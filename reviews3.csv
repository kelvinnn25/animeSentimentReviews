Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I love this anime for many reasons, but the foremost being the way it delves into the mind of the human machine. It shows just how hard it is to truly judge someone, and what lengths humans will go to if pushed to a certain point. 

Entertaining, original, visually appealing, somewhat gripping story, and characters that are easy to like. Although, I never truly got attached to the characters, which is really the only downside... at least for me. 

I would recommend this anime to anyone. You will be entertained, if not intrigued, throughout."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"When you finish watching something and your biggest complaint is that it wasn't long enough, it was probably pretty good.  Such was my reaction to Death Parade.  From an aesthetic perspective, the animation leaves little to be desired, and the premise is  fresh and thought provoking.  However, much of the show's time is spent developing (very) minor characters whom are featured in at most two episodes, leaving very little for the recurring members of the cast.  This is disappointing, as each and every one of them seems interesting enough to at least merit their own episode.  Of all of
                  ...
them, only the central pair is afforded significant development; the rest remain largely static for the duration of the show.

That said, I enjoyed every episode, and appreciate the attempt to bring the strange and arbitrary nature of death to mind.  If you are looking for an anime with a cast of colorful, if somewhat under-involved, characters, an unusual plot, and don't mind a bit of morbidity, consider giving Death Parade a shot."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Where do you go when you die? How the fuck should I know? Death Parade answers this question, which possibly could be the truth or not. We can't kill someone and ask them to see if it's true, because once they're dead... they won't come back.

Story: 8/10

Death Parade answers the question ""What happens when you die?"" in a great way. People randomly find themselves in a bar called Quindecim, where they get greeted by a mysterious white haired man named Decim. He askes them to play a game and shows them a bunch of mannequins, which would be what happens if you do not play
                  ...
the game. The people who walk into the bar are dumb, so they don't know that they're mannequins. They just think they're regular, dead corpses in some random room.

Before you die, you are either sent to heaven or hell. I exist to preside over that judgement. Something along the lines of that is what Decim says. But, it is not heaven or hell, it is the void or the reincarnation. Decim draws as much of the darkness out of the soul of the human as possible, and he takes it in. That is how he judges.

Art: 10/10

It's from MADHOUSE, which MADHOUSE makes fascinating animation. MADHOUSE has made a number of great anime series, so, if you want a good anime adaption, just go to MADHOUSE I guess. Unlike most series, Death Parade is a pure anime series. Manga is non-existent.

Sound: 9/10

The soundtrack is great, but the opening to the anime is kinda trolly. All the cheery things it shows in the opening have nothing to do with the deep shit that goes on in the anime.

Character: 9/10

The characters are good, I find myself to have enjoyed both arbiters, Decim and Ginti. Chiyuki was especially one of my favorites, considering... I don't know. I just have favorites but I don't have good enough reasons for why they're my favorite.

Overall: 9/10

Death Parade is a great anime that you should watch if you want a theory on what happens after you die. That's not really the reason you should watch it, just watch it if you're after a deep anime with a troll opening. 'Kay?"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Death Parade is now one of my all time favourite anime and I truly did not believe anything could rank so highly in my mind. This wouldn't be an anime that I would tell someone is in my top three - purely because anime with stronger fandoms seem better to me in the sense the fandom is always there - but I would think about the plot and the characters etc to this day.

Story (9) ~ Taking place in a bar called Quindecim hanging on the borders of the worlds of life and death, Decim - the quiet bartender - decides where people will go
                  ...
in the afterlife by testing them in psychological games that show their true colours and morals. Even though the story did have some plot holes and was confusing at times I was still rather engrossed in it and finished this anime in one day. And I guess the story contributes greatly to every other part of the anime that I love so much, building on the character of some just by being there.

Art (9)~ Things were a little too angular for my liking. There was an appropriate use/lack of colour depending on the situation, but I didn't like the sharpness to all the characters features. I guess it is the art style of the anime but it still bothered me a bit. 

Sound (10) ~ Good bejesus that opening song! I hated it and loved it at the same time. Come the final episodes you will understand why I hated it. It is one of those where you just have to sing along, like Shingeki no Kyojin I guess. The soundtrack of the whole anime is beautiful with one of the best pieces in episode 11 (I think) and really setting the mood perfectly and making me more emotional than I already was!

Character (10) ~ This, I believe, is the very element that is meant to draw you into the anime in the first place. Even characters that you only get to see for two episodes will make an impact on you with their personalities and backstories. All of them are intriguing and the main cast pretty much just makes me cry. 

Enjoyment (10) ~ This anime has made me laugh, cry and sing so ultimately just messed with my emotions. I was always invested in some way, scared for someone or feeling raging hatred for another, or crying for a few more. The characters are what gets you most invested in the story and they will be what you take away from this.

Overall Death Parade is an anime that I believe everyone should watch. Not only for its sadness and joy but also for the questions it raises and its own view on the world we live in. It is slow paced at times but that is mostly to build the mood, and this anime contains no fluff! Hallelujah!"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"This is quite a different fresh anime. You can tell right away by the art style. The art style is different than the usual and a little more realistic looking. This anime gets really intense at times and it does a good job at showing the full view of a human. It shows the darkest parts of humans souls. It shows that life is not always fair and that things are not just black and white. But this show is not just all dark and serious. It also has some touching, heartwarming and funny parts and the theme song is like the best thing ever.
                  ...
lol. Basically this show is about judgement after death. It is for sure worth a watch."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Hey everybody I try to write my first review on this page, so I chose Death Parade. I finished this one in 2 days and I was overwhelmed. A friend of mine gave me the hint to watch this anime, he only told me something about a bartender who let persons play a game of life and death and that was all. I liked the basic idea and so I gave it a try. What I find very fascinating in this anime is the development of the characters and for spoiler reasons I won't go into details. But what I can tell is that it's
                  ...
one of the best emotional animes I have ever watched. There are only a few anime and movies which made me cry and I count Death Parade also to it. 

Do you need to watch Death Parade? Yes, if you want to see great characters, which can not be any more different to another, a good and solide story, good animations/graphic then you will make the right choice. 

I hope this was not as bad as I think it is xD please forgive me for any grammar or writting mistakes, english is my foreign language."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Really interesting concept and enough is explained about the world to make it enjoyable without making the whole idea too complicated. This show has to be taken with a pitch of salt and just believe anything that is thrown at you… If you can do that then you will really love this.

This show is mainly episodic but I still couldn’t stop watching, the pacing is almost perfect and it seemed like the episodes were a lot shorter than 24 minutes. 

There are quite a lot of characters and I think some deserved more screen time than they got but that can be overlooked by the
                  ...
very deep understanding of the main characters that we get.
Just want to mention that I love the character designs, especially Nona. They’re fantastic also the colours and designs of different areas are also beautiful. Especially planet billiards!

The opening, ‘Flyers’ by Braido is one of my all-time favourite songs, (I really recommend having a look at the official video release too, it’s really…. Something…) 

Also... See if you can find the Death Note reference! ^_^"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Hello; 
So, i like short  and simple reviews but unfortunately i can't do that here, because they've already deleted one of my reviews, any way

Let's talk about Death Parade : 

Story : 7

The Story of this anime is based on a really Interesting idea, After death People must face one last challenge; a simple game with Bizarre conditions so they can be judged by certain ""Arbiters"" which they will  Decide where each person should go whether ""Heaven"" or "" Hell"" . 

The first few episodes are really good and fun to watch; you'll be learning about how this judging thing work and meet
                  ...
different characters, but after that the show became repetitive and slow paced , it feels like it's not going any where and there is no more action or a psychological thrill like the first episodes

Characters : 7 

The main characters on this anime are few, but they are really interesting like ""Decim"" and ""Nona"" but unfortunately we didn't get to learn more about them because the anime is really short, there are even some more persons we would've liked to know more about them like Oculus and Clavis and who actually they are .

Sound and Art : 8

The Animation is really great on this show, the scenes are well detailed , the art is really impressive and enjoyment for the eye , the same thing goes for the sound and the soundtracks; they are very good and really emotional and as you can see in the other reviews the opening is really catchy and fun 

Conclusion ""Overall "": 7

Death Parade have a great concept and an Original idea, but they failed to develop that it into a Complete anime, basically what i want to say is ""it could've been better "", any way its worth watching because its something new and you have always to try the new thing :) 

Thank you and Sorry for the bad grammer ! 

Selam"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Another Wonderful Piece made by Madhouse. This Anime conjures up the needles and threads about 'Death', into one entertaining, addicting, irresistible show! Going through the start of 'Death', and making it's way towards the end of it, it is certainly one of a kind.
-
Story: 10/10
Even though some people say that 'this story isn't getting anywhere because it's in a bar', has no right to say that. Just because an anime is secluded in a small area, doesn't mean it doesn't go anywhere. The story goes through people's 'death' and explains it from start to finish, through mesmerizing scenes. It does it in such a way
                  ...
that it both benefits from entertaining it's viewers, and showing what actually happened.

Art: 10/10
I am such a fan of art, i love cute anime's with awesome art. And I totally have noticed it in this anime as well! Sure it's not...specifically cute, but it is still AWESOME art! Definite 10/10!

Sound: 10/10
Oh man, what marvelous music! The soundtracks are so ... so...befitting of the anime! When it comes into 'mysterious' scene, the music they chose fits it so perfectly! It's truely amazing.

Character: 9/10
The characters could have had a little bit of help, maybe in 'growth', but then again it's not one of those anime's that focus on Character Development, more like 'Summarizing' the Characters. However, it still has great characters, i love them all! 

Enjoyment: 9/10
The way how the flow of the anime, it's just so soothing and relaxing, and then when the B.A. scenes come in, it's like WHAM! right in your face, and it's like you're experiencing what the characters experiencing! I'm so amazed that they've actually been able to Make it seem like its First Person. 

Overall: 10/10
This anime certainly deserves to have a high Rating. It's both 'educational' (to the extent of it not being academic educational, but educational in a way that it explains what goes on in a very entertaining way, you won't get bored of it!) and cinematic! It's not like those kind of anime's that explain things like they're writing on a chalkboard, no. It's one of those anime's that grabs you and throws you into the anime, guiding you through what goes on and this and that, it's really amazing."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Overall: 9/10
Death Parade is short anime about life and death.  It's presented somewhat episodically, but with a strong enough overarching narrative to keep the plot steady.  While somewhat abstract, the questions Death Parade asks its viewers (and characters) are intriguing, and it's the type of anime I was thinking about well after it finished.  

Story: 8/10
In Death Parade, characters called ""arbiters"" judge the recently deceased as they pass through a purgatory-like world.  The dead are tested in a game to determine the quality of their soul, and then subsequently sent to either Heaven or Hell based on the arbiter's decision. 
                  ...
Every game attempts to push the deceased to a point where they'll show their true character, so there's an element of mystery to it as you and the arbiter are trying to discover what type of person they really are.  As a game designer, I found this aspect of the series to be a lot of fun, and it works well to supplement the more emotionally heavy segments.

While the trials the deceased go through are entertaining, the real meat of the series is in how the arbiters themselves are judged.  How can one truly judge humanity without any humanity themselves?  Doesn't everyone have at least some capacity to do evil?  These are the types of questions Death Parade asks.  It's subtle about it, so there isn't really a point it's trying to shove in your face, but the themes are there.  

As I mentioned earlier, the story in Death Parade is fairly abstract, so it asks you to suspend your disbelief almost immediately.  While the world is adequately fleshed out, there could definitely be some more clarification on the setting and overall structure of the arbitration system.  A little more stipulation on the setting and mechanics of the world would have gone a long way.  Still, I very much think these problems are negligible as the show is almost entirely character driven.

Art: 8/10
Death Parade has a fairly standard art style, though the quality of animation during the more emotional segments is very powerful.  When the theme is designed around pushing characters to their emotional limits, the animation has to reflect that, and it does so in spades.  

Sound: 9/10
In terms of voice acting (sub), there was a large task of portraying the huge range of emotions characters had to express, and like the artists, the voice actors deliver.  The two leads in particular give some very great performances throughout the series.  

Character: 10/10
As stated before, Death Parade is a very character driven show.  Every so often, new side characters are introduced as simple archetypes, but slowly evolve throughout their judgement into three dimensional human beings.  They don't know they're dead upon reaching the arbiter, so seeing how each person deals with their slow realization of the situation is very compelling.  Some I sympathized with, some I pitied, and some I disliked, but there are no characters I completely despised. Every single character is justified in his/her motivations, which makes it all the more challenging for the arbiters to judge them.  This pattern is extremely riveting, and the questions it presents for the main characters are what really push it over the top.

The main characters themselves get the benefit of having the entire show to develop, and the payoff is truly wonderful.  Decim and his assistant are the primary arbiters, though they have conflicting ideals in how an arbiter's job should be done.  The growth created from this conflict was very real, and you wonder yourself how you'd judge the deceased were you in their shoes.  Both characters serve to show how complex an arbiter's job is, and they do so masterfully.

Enjoyment: 9/10
Death Parade is something of an emotional roller coaster.  I went from happy, to sad, to angry, to heartbroken - it's really a tough one to get through.  I tend to binge shorter series like these in a single sitting, but I simply couldn't do it with this one.  It was only 12 episodes, but it felt much longer to me due to how emotion-packed it was.  The show is great, but there were times when I simply couldn't watch another episode due to the previous one leaving me so weighed down.  

The questions it had me thinking of after the fact, however, really bring it up several notches for me.  I'm not particularly religious, but it makes me wonder how you could even judge somebody based on their past experiences in life.  After watching this series, it seems like an impossible task to me.  I commend the creators for taking on such bold material.

In conclusion, Death Parade is sort of a conduit for posing questions about life and death, though it's never in your face enough to subtract from the core narrative.  It has its underlying themes, but it's still a solidly told story with well-written characters.  Suffice it to say, Death Parade is a very mature anime, so while I do recommend watching it, do so when you're ready to really sit down and take it all in."

Review : 

A lot of anime try to pull off the deep, 
psychological route, exploring themes that run a 
bit deeper than ""how can I get senpai to notice 
me"" or ""the power of friendship."" Unfortunately, 
most of these shows fail, either by fault of not 
...
committing enough to the idea, sacrificing depth 
for shallow entertainment, or by taking themselves 
too seriously, mistaking false depth for 
watchability. 

Death Parade, thankfully, is neither of these. 

By merit of its effective use of episodic stories in 
an overarching narrative, Death Parade manages to 
explore many themes surrounding death while not 
coming off as overly macabre or dismissive. It 
acknowledges that life is both cruel in its fairness
and merciful in its unfairness; that humans are 
both kind and monstrous; that death is both a 
tragic loss and a comforting conclusion. Better 
still, Death Parade does this through interesting 
stories, gripping even at one-episode lengths, and
through well-designed characters, who remain 
memorable regardless of their screen time. 

The show isn't without its flaws, but they're largely 
marginal. Some of the plot elements introduced in
the latter half of the show are poorly fleshed out, 
though whether this was a product of poor pacing
or intentionally vague storytelling is anyone's 
guess. Likewise, while the show remains 
entertaining as an episodic work, the show has the 
pacing of a Slice of Life while dangling the 
foreshadowing of a drama, which inspires a feeling 
that's less ""anticipation"" than ""confusion."" 

The OST, courtesy of Hayashi Yuuki, is nothing 
short of brilliant. ""Moonlit Night"" is currently one of 
my favorite instrumental tracks, and I can see it 
staying in my top 5 for quite some time. The same 
can be said for the OP - there's just something 
about FLYERS that puts me in a great mood, and 
it's such a FUN sequence. I usually skip the OP to 
shows once I've seen it a few times, but for Death 
Parade the OP itself was a highlight of the week. And, the ED, Last Theater by NoisyCell was such a brilliant and polarizing track that I can't come up with words to describe it. 

Death Parade is, in a word, fantastic. It was a true 
pleasure to watch."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"After successfully throwing people off with its awfully deceptive opening that makes you think otherwise, this show brings forth nothing but serious themes and questions. It is, in essence, a case study on the depths of humanity’s dark hearts. As such, labelling it as a series with “loosely connected episodes containing nothing but death-games” would be a rather large disservice to it – despite the fact that the statement isn’t necessarily a lie. 

Human beings are selfish creatures by nature. By pushing them to the limit – to the doors of death – you can see them unleash their ugly side. That’s the concept utilized
                  ...
by the “arbiters” – the people who judge you during these trials by them and based on your actions either sentence you to “nothingness” or “reincarnation”. If only things were as simple as that, though, then the show wouldn’t be as interesting as it is. There are various instances where you’d be presented with cases where everything’s been painted in different shades of grey. You wouldn’t know who to side with – empathize with the person who did the “right” thing but ended up going against something you’d consider the “humane” thing to do as per your conscience? Or side with the guy whose situation you clearly empathize with but has clearly done something wrong? But then again, what if whatever you're thinking is probably the farthest thing from the truth and you're wrong about the characters, their motivations and your judgement regarding their ""deeds""? It just makes you question and does it perfectly without coming off as obnoxiously vague. 

The episodes are structured in such a way that it keeps things from feeling repetitive and redundant. Had a super serious and super depressing episode? The next one would probably be a little more on the light side and would show the brighter side of human beings. And just when you’re about to think that it’ll stay fully episodic till the end, it throws an arc that spans multiple episodes at you. So on and so forth. It definitely knows how to keep itself from going stale – rest assured, there’s enough variety in the games to keep things from feeling same-y.   

With all that said, one aspect where Death Parade falters a bit is its usage of characters. It tries to do quite a lot in the short span of time it possesses and succeeds to a degree with a few characters but a large part of the cast just don’t get enough attention for them to develop into something substantial. Which is a shame since they definitely do not lack as far as characterization is concerned – they’re a colorful bunch who definitely would’ve benefited from just a little more time in the spotlight. 
The art is consistent and animation is fluid. OST serves its purpose well. Madhouse definitely didn’t slack off as far as production values of the show is concerned. It, simply put, looks and sounds really good. Both the opening as well as the ending song deserve a mention – they’re both fantastic tracks.

All in all, Death Parade isn’t a show to be missed. It is a flawed gem that you don’t often come across. If it wasn’t on your radar till now, I hope this review changed things for you.  

Overall - 7.6 ~ 8.0"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Overall I found this anime to be quite good. I enjoyed watching this and would highly recommend watching it.

Story7/10
The story was pretty interesting, especially for being only twelve episodes long. In the beginning episodes, it delves into the stories of multiple people and does this throughout the series without becoming confusing. The background of each minor character was revealed just enough. Not too much to become overwhelming, but not too little to become confusing or to make you feel left out. The concept of the story itself was interesting and captured my attention. I remember thinking: ""So this anime is about an arbiter that judges
                  ...
a human's soul? Cool!"" I awaited finding out who would be reincarnated and who would be sent to the void.  However, the story did have some flaws. As I previously mentioned, I enjoyed being left to wonder who would be reincarnated or sent to the void, naturally I wish there was more of this. Episode 9, being my favorite episode because of this. Honestly I felt that the story line in that particular episode could have been a series in its own. In addition to that, I did find myself asking some questions at the end of the series. Originally I was confused about who was sent where, the masks above the elevators were never explained even though they were extremely critical to the story and characters. This annoyed me. Another question I found myself asking concerned Ginti. Ginti is a usually pissed off an impatient character, but enjoyable as much of the humor in the series usually concerns Ginti. So my problem with Ginti? If arbiters have no emotions why is Ginti always angry? Decim remained apathetic until the last few episodes, but Ginti? It is mentioned that there have been arbiters with human emotions planted inside them, but only briefly and vaguely. This remained unanswered throughout the series. 7/10

Art 9/10
The art was both dark when it needed to be and light when it was necessary. As an artist myself, I found the facial anatomy of some of the characters to be slightly disproportionate, for example, The spacing between Decim's mouth and nose was a bit too exaggerated, but it still fit his character and did not bother me too much for that reason. There was a good attention to detail in both major areas, such as the bar and minor places, such as Clavis's elevator. 9/10

Sound 9/10
The voice acting in both the English dub and Japanese dub were very good. I usually don't watch dubbed anime and prefer it in its original format, but I found the voice acting for the English version to be more than adequate, even superior to the Japanese version. Both versions are dynamic and exciting and I would recommend watching both versions if you can. The ending and opening of each episode was well represented both vocally and artistically. The opening is upbeat and fun! To the point where I found myself bobbing my head and humming along. The ending is dark and powerful, especially so in the last episode and was a great way to end the show. 9/10

Characters 8/10
Each character was dynamic and well rounded. Enough information was provided about each minor character just enough to hooker the watcher. Characters were a far cry for each other which allows for mass appeal, from subtle characters like Yousuke to outgoing characters like Harada. All of the ""judged"" characters had just enough mystery about them that you don't know what they may do, which kept me on edge. However the only problem I had with the character design in the series, is probably the most important. The problem resides in the main characters who at times were.... For lack of a better word, boring. Although Decim and Chiyui are interesting and dynamic characters, in about the middle of the series I grew bored. Chiyui has no memories and therefore I felt disconnected from her and Decim had no emotions until the end and is therefore very, very reserved. However both characters were redeemed in my eyes towards the end, especially in the last episode as both became far less flat. 8/10

Enjoyment 9/10

I felt very excited at the start of each episode to find out who would be saved and who would be sent to the void. I also felt a great deal of suspense at the end of each episode and wanted to find out what would happen next. Action packed episodes were well done, but there were far to few of them. I would have liked to see a game between two people being judged more than Chiyui and Decim being awkward at the bar. 9/10

Overall 9/10

I would greatly recommend this anime to anyone who would like to see a suspenseful, interesting anime. The art and sound are great, the characters are dynamic, save for a few.

Pros:
Art is dynamic and there is a great attention to detail
Great voice acting, both in dub and sub
Great music and openings/endings
Interesting concept
Interesting characters
Interesting and suspenseful judgements
Great feeling of excitement and suspense when watching
Fantastic last episode

Cons:
Unanswered questions
Main characters need to be explained more than the minor characters!
We need more action packed scenes!
Boredom mid way through until the last couple episodes.
I have to wait for season two!"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"The best thing about this anime is that you can discuss a bunch of serious topics with the people that watched it. It touches subjects referring to judgment and how it is passed onto people. It touches the topic of death. It touches the topic of the purpose for life. And it also touches the topic of sins on people's souls, the worst ones, the ones that stay with you forever, because they change you.
You yourself will be the judge of judges, you by watching will be the person judging if they are doing things right or wrong. You will judge if eternal void is
                  ...
a good place for certain person, or if heaven is destined for the other. You will be the arbiter.
Coz this piece is about judgment, represented in a twisted way of a elegant bar, and mysterious bartender, watching every move and listening to every word spoken.
Better prepare yourself for a mindful session of hard thinking. 

VIBE:
Here you find yourself at a bar. A very stylish one, with chandelier, fishes in water glasses, classy couches and a bunch of standard games, such as pool, poker, darts. Very basic.
And yet so complex. 
The bartender glances at a pair of people with no expression on his face, saying ""Please sit down, Im Decim and I will be your bartender today""
And then it just go top. Through these purposely simple games he will judge people. Judge their lifes, judge their sins, judge the actions. How they react, what they do.
He will push them into extreme situations, to see how they behave and will their response be like.
Basically it's great, you feel the tension. Sometimes you might get anxious, sometimes you might say ""That was justice"" and sometimes you just might be said for how unfair things can be. My advice: watch closely, for that little things are important in the series, stay focused. 
I don't really have to say much, first episode is one of the best introductory episodes I have seen. It just explains everything in one go.
I'm just gonna behave like a person sending you there, giving you a small peek of what you CAN experience, and what you SHOULD experience.
Bartender waits for you.

ART STYLE:
It is amazingly beautiful, it's almost like an anime movie. You know anime movies always look better, and it almost looks like one. 
All the characters, with no expetion, look attractive in their own way, you can't look away, you want to enjoy every and each detail of them. They are designed in a way, where every and each one of them has different trait, all of them are recongizeable by something cool, and so small that you won't notice it's a thing, marvelous job.
I don't even have to talk about animation quality, it's the top end of the line. Just please make more of these animes, they look gourgeous. Im tired of Kyoto Animation style all over the place, give me something new and original!

MUSIC/VOICEACTING:
Let's start with music. I really like the opening. It just makes you wanna dance, no jokes. It doesnt correspond to anything in the anime, it's totally random, with the exception that they really are in a bar. It's fantastically animated, and the music is great. As well as the ending, which is actually epic. I love it, they managed to make so universal, that it could be used during the episode making it more epic, great stuff.
Voiceacting is nice. I think that the most difficult part in recording the voices were the bits that required emotional shouting or the bits that were supposed to show a certain emotion, a negative one to be clear. They managed to do so, they managed to show what is speaking through these people, and how different all them can be. 

STORYLINE:
As much as I would like to say that the storyline was good, I cannot really. The thing is that there was some main plot going through it, but it was not executed in a way that I would consider it finished. I loved the little plots, that were running around through like two-three episoedes, all of them were great, and it is great to watch it, I liked it a lot. It's just that they ran out of time to finish everything properly, and that I am sad about. And that also gives us a suggestion for the second season. Hopefully it will be as good.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion Im just gonna say, that it's a good experience, and it gives you a moment to think about stuff. Is your life meaningful? What is after death? How will you be judged? These are great questions to talk about. Find somebody to discuss it with, you will get much more from the series.
And my advice, look at small things, sometimes they might give a hint to understand a bunch of stuff. Be focused. And otherwise, ENJOY!

Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"This my friends is what I can call a true, anime masterpiece.
I will now explain why :


FIirst, there's the story, it's also very original and catchy. To put it simply, it's about when people die, they go to Heaven or Hell but before going to either one, they must be judged by an arbiter (like Decim for example, but he isn't the only arbiter).
However in this anime, there is no Heaven and Hell, instead, you have the ""Reincarnation"" which means the dead peeps get to live again on earth or you get ""The Void"" *creepy dramatic music playing* xD (it's basically on other term for
                  ...
Hell, I guess, Idk) 

Anyways, to judge dead people, the arbiter has to make them play a game...and that's when...""SHIT BE GETTING REAL!"" xD.
I can't really explain the complexity of the games because that would make my review way to long though, and I don't wanna spoil. But what I can tell you guys is that the games are meant to discover the ""dead people"" most inner rage, or evil intentions, or perversion, or anything bad. Then the arbiter chooses if the dead person gets to be Reincarnated or gets to go to ""The Void"" *more dramatic music plays*

Also, the two main characters are really lovable and fun, now Decim: this man, is just an amazing and extremely original to the anime world. Handsome, white hair, a sexy voice and blue eyes, this guy has a very interesting and complex personality, it's not hard to crack but interesting to look into. Even though at first, he appears to be abit strange at first, a little bit unjust and cold-hearted as well, but we slowly discover little by little an extremely nice man. And everyone ( and I mean EVERYONE/ men and women) should love him at the end of the show.

- Then there is Chiyuki: This is actually my favorite character of all. She is a nice, cool, composed and beautiful. It's actually thinks to her that, we the viewers get to see Decim change from a ""rock"" to a really sweet man. Love Them.


Anyways, this show, will make you laugh and cry (Yes! in this show THERE IS COMEDY!!!! hooray! x3), it kinda helps get through that sadder moments of the show, so that's good. And an other good thing, it doesn't have a crappy, gloomy feel to it about death and stuff, it's actually cute and nice.
Overall, I definitely recommend Death Parade, it's great, and I garanty tons of enjoyment."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"All hail Madhouse! All hail Madhouse! The best studio as far as I'm concerned took another leap in the anime world with adding Death Parade to its resume. Death Parade had the potential to be the ANIME OF THE YEAR in 2015, until Saitama one-punched the shit out of that hope (another Madhouse production). but with further ado let's review Death Parade.

The story was unique and captivating on all aspects that it flashed. The story in 13 episodes raised so many interesting questions, and the premise of these arbiters judging where humans end up in afterlife was thrilling to say the least. The story didn't
                  ...
stray or falter not once in my eyes, it stayed true to the beginning and end.

The art of this show was beautiful, and I can't say enough about the opening of Death Parade it is AMAZING, and it is kind of needed because this show can be dark when it wants to, so the upbeat music plays off the serious theme of the show.

The characters aren't much to brag about the arbiters are devoid of human emotion, and the humans that are in the show aren't there for long, so you don't get the luxury of getting much character development.

All in all this show is worthy of an anime of the year tag, so it's not much else to say other than, if you haven't seen this anime by 2016, gets to it, it's never too late to witness greatness."
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Ok, this is my first review, so I'm going to be frank. This is one of the best animes I have watched recently, and I highly recommend it. 

Story 10/10
Why? because it was completely original like nothing I have ever seen. Had me guessing the whole time about what was going to happen...

Art 10/10
I just loved the art on this one. Especially the eyes...

Sound 9/10
Even though i absolutely LOVED the opening, the ending didn't appeal much to me...
...

Character 10/10
Every character is well thought out, and completely understandable. Great character development throughout the series.

Enjoyment 10/10
I enjoyed every second of this anime. And when i say every second, I even mean the opening theme.

Overall 10/10
A must watch anime. Whether you are planning to watch it or are already watching it, It is perfect for everyone (except maybe for people who are not into sad memories and such...) But it was worth every tear I shed... go watch it now!"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I think what really stood out about this show is how they portray death. According to Death Parade, when you die, you'll be sent to be judged for whether you should be reincarnated or enter the void. However, there are flaws in the judgement process that Chiyuki, and eventually Decim notice. Emotions play a huge part of this anime-in the story and with those who watch it. Every episode is unique, and sort of toils with the mind. I don't find any flaws with this anime because it has its own type of story:)"

STORY: 9
The plot of Death Parade seems to be simple, and it kind of is. Even so, the series always have something unexpected. Each chapter is completely unique, and you will never get bored. The final is outstanding.

ART: 9
Charachters designs are quite cool, the eyes of the arbitrators are amazing, and each puppet is dressed in different ways. 

SOUND: 8
Favourite opening ever! I also loved the ending, by the way. Even so, the soundrack
                  ...
in general is not outstanding. Still, it has good piano and violin music.

CHARACTER: 10
I fell in love with each one of the characters. Every one of them is so one-of-a kind, and you get to know them really well. Human feelings are amazingly explained, and you are able to know how people think using their memory fragments. 

ENJOYMENT: 10
I love this show. Watching it was never boring, the plot and the characters are so good that you have to keep watching.

OVERALL: 9
I would give it a 10, but I reserve it to masterpieces. This anime has made me laugh and cry. It is highly recommended. You will love the story. 

Thanks for reading!"
Death_Parade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"There are some anime series which promise you the world then never take you anywhere, and then there are some series that never make any promises or guarantees but simply show you what they've got by taking you on a magical journey instead.

While ""magical"" may appear to be a strange word to describe this series (since magic is apparently never even used in it), for me it was an experience that took me to another world not only visually and artistically, but also emotionally and psychologically. 

Having previously watched some of the most popular anime series in the last couple of years and being utterly
                  ...
disappointed by their failure to deal with themes such as death and purgatory (Angel Beats) as well as their need to recur to incest for the sake of shock value and audience interest (Oreimo), I was beginning to question what happened to good ole, heartfelt, tear-jerking anime (and before you ask, no, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is not one of them). Luckily, I managed to stumble upon this little  gem before it was too late and I started regretting watching anime altogether. 

Suddenly, enduring the pain and boredom that came from watching all the incompetent shows mentioned above seemed finally worth it. Here was an anime that actually took life, death, and its audience seriously. A story about survival, sorrow and despair that didn't need to turn into a half-baked harem in an attempt to make it more enjoyable (yes SAO, I'm looking at you). 

Although the ""toughest"" psychological parts are contained in the first and last episodes, there are enough unanswered questions and mysterious clues to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. In the meantime, you'll get to enjoy seeing ""death game"" scenarios play out in creepy settings and hear disturbing stories that sound like a teen goth's fantasy come to life. 

Fear not, however, as this show is anything but immature. From the plot itself to the animation as well as the use of CGI and background music, many aspects of this show are beautifully subtle. Sure, you may see fighting, screaming and crying (as well as the odd puddle of blood), but the story is all in the details, and, of course, your own conflicted thoughts and feelings  towards it (that will likely evolve as the story progresses).

As a result, this anime can become rather personal, for you are the one who decides just how much you should read into it and what you should make of it. 

It is perhaps for this reason that I don't really want to say anything about the plot other than the fact that it's definitely there and it's definitely beautiful (albeit in a somewhat tragic, melancholic way).

Nevertheless, this anime is not without its flaws, for some people often complain about how the ""supernatural"" characters could have used more actual character development as well as some back stories (therefore also focusing less on the ""humans""). While this may appear to be a valid argument initially, if you actually watch this show, you will eventually understand why their ""lack"" of character development and participation is in fact necessary to make the story work. 

While I do think that there were perhaps too many characters and that a smaller cast would have perhaps left the viewer with fewer unanswered questions (since the
world of the non-humans as well as their origins could have been explored in more detail), I personally had no problem with coming up with the answers myself. By asking the viewer to use their own brain and imagination to complete the missing pieces of the puzzle, this anime once again reminds you that it likes to do things differently by provoking your thoughts and emotions instead of spoon-feeding you pointless fan service. 

Furthermore, by sacrificing some parts of the story (or rather, avoiding coming up with additional and often unnecessary subplots), the series can actually be perfectly condensed into 12 episodes, hence making it a ""short and sweet"" piece of art instead of an over-milked cash cow. 

Besides its eeriness and originality, the one thing that really surprised me about this show was the opening. Although I personally don't consider it to be ""the best opening of all time"" like many other people do, I certainly loved it and found it to be somewhat shocking after having already read the premise and some general comments about the story. (I really don't want to spoil it for you, but think Madoka Magica).

Besides the lovely opening and ending, the OST is generally enjoyable and the music is cleverly employed to make your ride on  ""the feels train"" all the more of an unforgettable experience. 

Although I would have probably liked the trip to have lasted a bit longer, limited length is no problem for a show that knows how to properly deliver its content. In fact, it only makes it better. 

Despite watching a lot of anime, I rarely watch more than 4 episodes of the same series in a single day and have pretty much never binged any one series. Until I watched Death Parade, that is. 

This unusual behavior further confirmed my theory that, this show is, in fact — a masterpiece. My only regret comes from not having watched it sooner as well as from seeing it ranked relatively low compared to some of the appalling anime ranked above it. 

But that, my friends is a different story. If you're still reading this review instead of watching Death Parade then I can only ask ""Why What are you waiting for? Hurry! Stop reading this and go watch it now!"" I promise you won't regret it."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"There it is, a body on display, delicate fabric hugging its frame as if a part of its existence from the very beginning. Porcelain skin adorned with silk, the material complements the complexion. The figure stands there without concern for the wondering gaze of any passersby, a translucent wall erected between it and the endless faces. Society is kept at bay. The soft glow of light dancing on the surface of the sheet of glass serving as its imprisonment. It shimmers ever so slightly, creating prisms of color in the endless shuffle. The rays of light trails over the delicate frame of the figure. Beauty
                  ...
blossoming from a thing of tertiary value.  

But this is not Violet Evergarden I'm describing. 

Look beyond the object, beyond the fabric; zoom pass the crystalline glass wall, and suddenly, the true image of my purple prose takes shape. There it is, coming into focus, a JC Penny's mannequin positioned at the window front of a shopping mall district. The dancing lights, nothing but the cheap glow of neon signs from neighboring competitors adjacent to it. The wondering gazes, nothing but customers with money to spend.  

If embellishments for something so minuscule is all you need to be entranced by the item being described, then Violet Evergarden will not bother you. However, if you desire content equally as deserving of the words being used to describe it, then it might benefit you to move on to greener pastures, because like this opening paragraph, so too is the material on display hyper-stylized rendering of a truly insignificant thing. The main difference being the tool; flowery words traded in for audiovisual frontloading. Layered color gradients supplemented in place of proper diction. Lots of icing, very little cake. 

But it's not all a lost cause. VE's story is one of relation. Or rather, everything surrounding it facilitates sentiments easy to relate to. One that practically writes itself. A person used as an instrument of war attempting to find ways to rekindle their lost humanity. An appointed position that gives opportunities to do just that. A girl disciplined in strict military decorum. A puppet with its strings cut loose, unsure as to what to do with her newfound freedom. She's a lost child, forgotten by society, forced to start from scratch. A holdover from a wartorn nation whose usefulness is brought to a crossroads. The story ends with the closing of one chapter, as we begin the journey of another. The journey is that of recovery. A journey aided by the guiding hands of someone not there in the flesh. Efforts made from beyond the grave for her betterment. One that will serve as her driving force towards improvement as well as the source of her grief as she draws closer to the answers she seeks.

Through her, we're introduced to this world. One made up like a quilt of different time periods and cultural influences, all stitched together to create something new. Victorian-era structures serve as the city skyline while the undeniable look of early 20th-century technology takes the form of motor vehicles, as well as a wide assortment of widgets and trinkets littered throughout the environment. Our person of interest, Violet, equally as blended. Her appearance is that of an unassertive young woman, while her mechanical limbs tell a different story. A story of violence and darkness. This temperament reflected in her personality. She only sees things in utilitarian ways; typewriters are weapons, school is a mission, her job becomes headquarters, saluting whenever given orders, requesting permission for all her actions. Social graces are completely lost on her. Her upbringing robbing her of the privilege to decide. There was only ever one path for her to take. Until recently, her actions were that of a blade, sheathed, just waiting for the time that its usefulness was required once again. An instrument of death whenever its wielder sees fit.

Her new job changes that. She must write for others as an ""Auto Memory Doll,"" a profession where she's tasked to transcribe the feelings and thoughts of others, giving a voice for those that have trouble doing so on their own accord. A job where recorded sentiments are captured in a letter. A chance for an emotionally stunted girl to learn what feelings are. A ""doll"" wanting to become a doll, when in fact, the act of becoming one is what brings her closest to humanity.  

As I said, the show writes itself. 

A self-oscillating arbiter of ""good content"" for anyone wanting to express why it's ""good content."" The mere act of explaining its basic premise does the legwork for them. Except for the fact that when the content is lifted from the pages of its screenplay and brought to life by the magic of animation, it's equally as flaccid as the diegetic information would have you believe when following a character of such stunted social growth. It's a show perfect for overthinking, perfect for negating any naysayer, where issues are fended off as ""it's meant to be that way."" Subject matter created to facilitate a drab character doing things in a drab fashion. A machine-like girl with mechanical limbs given a task to emulate empathy. Her stilted, often wooden personality is accounted for by her upbringing. She's that way because she's SUPPOSED to be that way. It's all very self-serving. ""To wear one's faults on their sleeve"" taken quite literally. 

It would have worked too, had there been no viable means to circumvent such insular logic. But here's where knowledge supersedes those counterarguments. Where one's experience can allow criticism to stick. This isn't the first anime to house such themes. And of those that did so before it, there are definitive examples of ""better"" out there disallowing the open acceptance of wooden behavior solely for the fact that the character's given circumstances allows it. Humans aren't that flat. To enable such simple-minded evaluations in place of spotting genuine issues is to trivialize the complexities of the human race altogether.

We already know what it would be like for an apathetic person unable to function without the strict regiment of paramilitary life because we've seen it done with a pedigree of writing befitting the serious subject matter. People that carry the baggage of their actions, the haunting memories of the things they've seen, unable to let go, to fully allow oneself to be integrated into society. We know what this looks like because well-developed personalities like Kazuki Fuse from Jin-Roh exists. Major Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell exists. Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist exists. PTSD is not a scapegoat for underwritten performances, and it should never be accepted as one. 

These issues are made visible by VE's very crowning achievement. Pristine art and animation that ends up highlighting the thin veneer of its inherent value. The undeniable look of sterile sleekness. The artifice of humanistic warmth made bare by the prim and proper order towards everything on display. Everything and everyone is made beautiful. Age, circumstances, genetics; none of it matters. Mandated aesthetics dictate this world. You die beautifully. You get angry beautifully. You get beaten up with style. Even tears are delivered with streams of diamond-like orbs, with the owners' faces made for the camera. Everyone in this world like that of runway models, all given a chance to play civilians. Realism made implausible when all inhabitants look like they should be doing photo ops for H&M brochures. Any attempt at realism placed further on cease-and-desist when glimpses of battles are depicted with shounen-like fight sequences. A place where even the grim outcome of war must be performed with a sense of commissioned poetics, all done to appease the vision of a director too busy with their pursuit for a particular aesthetic to let the content speak for itself. Content that effectively gets in the way of its own vision because it's never granted the chance to breathe. 

Natural light emulation that aims for Call Me by Your Name but lands somewhere along the lines of The Visit. How an anime could suffer from overexposure is beyond me. Goes to show you that when you emulate without understanding, the issues are copied as well. Time-lapse photography used in every episode, not for any purpose other than to show off. Lens blur effects used for flashbacks and present-time, not because there's a reason to but because the director can. Everything is in service of this perfectness. This very unnatural attempt at being ""natural"" utterly self-defeating of its intentions. 

This is equally true for moments underlined with genuine character outbursts. 

Silence is powerful. Playing music over every scene is amateur. Words drowned out by plucked strings, the steadily held notes of a violin, piano keys dolled out just as quickly; all of this without concern for what the characters are saying. Entire dialogue exchanges where silence is appropriate is washed out by a wall of sound. It doesn't compliment the material; it hijacks it. There's a time and a place for everything, this anime never come to realize that fact. 

It may take drowning out its content before one take notice of what good is there, but in that regard, Violet Evergarden is not without merit. Our protagonist may be an empty vessel with flickers of humanity tucked inside, but thankfully we're not made hostage by her presence, as every chapter in VE is in service of someone else. People of far greater interest than herself. Their emotional range not limited—even when presented with the same aesthetic brushstrokes that everything is painted in—their humanistic tendencies find a way to radiate outward. And as a vessel, Violet is given a chance to charter her clients' emotions to those on the receiving end of the expressed affection, and through that task itself, is able to find a way to expound upon her own feelings in return. The broad spectrum of accumulated emotions serving as the proxy towards finding her own. The idea itself is very appropriate. I would even go as far as saying that it's thoughtful. It also operates with a pace befitting the subject matter, even if that pace is considered to be a problem to some. These things need time to happen. Thankfully, Violet is alotted that. 

It's all told through carefully selected vignettes, being brought together by motifs relating back to nature, its seasons, and the various foliage that comes to represent them:

▸The story of Iris, a girl named after the flowers in bloom in her small village, seeking out an existence away from her meager upbringing. Unwilling to accept rejection, an act of stubborn pride catalyzes her steps forward. 
▸The story of Luculia, a pleasant disposition befitting the flower she's named after. She puts the feelings of her loved one ahead of herself. Hoping for their eventual emotional recovery from a tragedy that robbed them both of normalcy. 
▸The unofficial sigils of two kingdoms: one a white rose, the other red. Lovers-to-be and penpals brought together by political circumstances, but share a love that aligns beyond the expanded power and peace of their union. 
▸The final days of a mother, the autumn leaves fall as a countdown to her departure from the land of the living, wanting nothing more than to find a means to comfort the daughter that she's leaving behind. 
▸The blanket of snow that covers a warring nation in frozen stasis. People refusing to move forward. Like their winter surroundings, they too remain cold towards each other, leaving their country in a state of civil unrest.  

And then there's the story of Violet herself, named after a wildflower in bloom; she's plucked out of the custody of a heartless man and into the care of one that sees beyond her reduced form. A disheveled mess, only treated as a tool, one meant to be used and later disposed of; the man sees differently. He wants her betterment at any cost, even if that means paying the ultimate price. 

There is a beauty here when you view the intentions behind every chapter. The problem stems from the execution itself. Beautiful on paper doesn't translate to well-done in reality. Funny enough, the doll-like nature of the protagonist and her initial attempts at writing serves as a sort of meta-commentary for the content on display: 

Her intent is earnest, she wants to understand the expressions and feelings being directed her way, but like her mechanical limbs, so too is the show written with a sense of artificiality. An emulation of real-life that can't muster up to being anything more than that. 

Violet Evergarden is a beautiful plastic rose with stuck-on water droplets. It's well-kept. Never finding the beauty in decay. Never needing to accept the full spectrum of life simply because its creators are wholly content with being ""perfect."" True beauty is found in the blemishes. Within the scuffle of humanity's futility towards greater ambitions. True beauty comes from the majesty of life itself making mankind a mere moment in a pool of infinity. True beauty is humbling. 

It's through the imperfections that true beauty is emitted. Violet Evergarden is pretty to look at, but with the absence of this understanding, it could never be the real thing, it could never be ""true beauty."""
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Waking up one day and discovering Violet Evergarden getting an anime adaptation by Kyoto Animation should be a blessing. At least that’s what it looked like on the surface. The light novel series earned the grand prize from the Fifth Kyoto Animation in the novel category. Even with two volumes, my expectations going into this anime was high. In particular, the sheer visual quality is a sight to feast on. However, Violet Evergarden isn’t exactly just known for that but does that mean it’s something to be praised?

Written by Kana Akatsuki, the light novel series is a story about Auto Memory Dolls. They are dolls
                  ...
are made by Dr. Orland, a scientist who used them to assist his wife in writing novels. However, these dolls were also rented out to others for service. The main plot revolves around an Auto Memory Doll named Violet Evergarden as she tries to discover her purpose in life.

As someone who came into this series half prepared (I have read parts of the light novel), I felt I was ready enough. The first few episodes came in as anime originals and that left me with some mixed reception. However, I will say that the pilot episode was a terrific picture. Beyond the lush quality and the visual magnificence, Violet Evergarden presented a story with heavy emotions. It synchronizes with the drama and melancholy of what I had anticipated. However, the main selling point of the show is titular character Violet Evergarden herself. The story feels like a character study that puts over her above the rest of the cast. Every episode focuses on Violet in some way through her role in the story, her interactions with others, and how she develops as a character. The conflicts she experiences tests her feelings and how she responds to them by trying to understand others. It draws viewers into asking questions about how she can develop as a character and in a lot of ways, I think the show did do that quite well. For instance, Violet displays a lot of human characteristics and tries to understand others. The most prominent scenes features her desperately trying to learn what “love” is and to me, this series chronicles her experience like a life journey of discovery. Unfortunately, I can’t really say that the first few episodes were well thought out in characterizing Violet as a memorable character. Beyond her expressions and role, it seems the show repeats a lot of the same things over and over. The example includes Violet expressing why she is an Auto Memory Doll and it gets tedious fast. It also doesn’t help much that the other side characters seemingly react in similar ways to Violet. My main concern for the first few episodes were mainly how this can keep viewers interested with such a way of storytelling.

Fortunately, the series does get better and puts emphasis in some of the side characters. While the plot feels non-linear at times, some of the other characters do get spotlight through effective background storytelling. For instance, one of the episodes featured a 14 year old princess who gets engaged to a prince and while this seemed like a cheesy love tale at first, it resolved in a very emotional way. It gave me the impression that certain side characters are worth investing time into. In the meantime, the series does eventually step into the light novel adaptation territory as we learn more about Violet’s past and connection with someone very important to her. That person would be Gilbert Bougainvillea, a major in the Leidenschaftlich Army and someone that influenced Violet a lot since she met him. As we look at Violet’s past, we learn how they met and how much he treasure her like a person rather than a doll. It’s also important to note that Violet feels comfort whenever she is around him and not lonely. The anime in the present timeline portrays Violet as a very lonely character and doesn’t have someone to depend on. In doing so, it establishes Violet as a character that has a hard time understanding others. This is especially true for her after she heard Gilbert’s final words. The show dedicates time to explore Violet’s change since the past and how she reflects her experiences in the present. As I mentioned before, the series takes a lot of time into examining Violet as a character and getting viewers to understand her. The side characters play important roles in later episodes to make Violet reflect on her past deeds. To me, it’s effective storytelling as it really made me understand her behavior. The more I understood her, the more compelling her character became. I don’t know if this was the creator’s intention from the start but honestly, it does come together as a well delivered plan.

Now you’re probably thinking of the story contains too much drama for its own good. In some ways, it does but in other ways, it’s also important for the main story. You have to remember that the timeline takes place after a war that Violet was previously involved in. Stories about war often involves pain, tragic memories, and even death. For Violet, she experienced the realities of war. Obviously, there’s going to be a lot of drama and its effect on the storytelling can be received with mixed receptions. I had some mixed feelings in general about Violet’s past as while it can definitely evoke emotions, it doesn’t feel unique enough to be memorable. In other words, I’m more interested in how she develops as a character in the present rather than focusing on her past. Even if it’s significant for her characterization, the drama presented in the background stories doesn’t always feel too impactful. I get it though. Some people will probably point fingers and say that it’s necessary. Others may agree with what I mentioned here. To me, I’m still more interested in Violet’s development in the present than who she is in the past. Otherwise, Violet’s role in the show feels more than just a protagonist. She is the character.

Anyone watching this series will easily recognize the powerful production of the show. This is perhaps one of Kyoto Animation’s best work yet in terms of technical quality. The world setting has natural and lush landscapes with European style architecture detailed with vivid colors. Every camera shot feels impactful and there’s no drop in quality in any episode. Body movements are also timed precisely well to highlight every fine detail such as Violet’s character expressions and role as a doll. Speaking of which, Violet’s character design makes her look very elegant. If you haven’t known about her background story, it’s hard to recognize her as a former soldier. Her signature hand is also a trademark animated with impressive features. It communicates the message to viewers as what she is. Other characters in the show also stand out with their human characteristics. While there’s no fan service in the show, there are characters such as Cattelya that can be very pleasing to the naked eyes. It’s clear to me that Kyoto Animation and the creative team poured a sheer amount of effort into making this series as a whole. The theme songs also highlights a sensitive feeling of melancholy to match the series’ tone while character voice mannerism for the majority of the cast are able to keep up with their momentum. The music and OST also hits the mark to deliver what's intended especially for the emotional drama.

It’s definitely a series that felt different to me compared to some of other Kyoto Animation’s recent works. This one was an emotional storyteller that gave us a reason why we should care about Violet Evergarden; not just the story but Violet’s own journey of discovery. While I can’t say it’s always an effective tearjerker, it’s still a show that’s worth investing time into. Well done, Kyoto Animation. You gave me a better hope for your future."

From the dome of quality differences comes Violet Evergarden. Show half episodic, half character-driven, half story-driven. Yet all these halves barely make one show. 

We mainly see try-hard attempts on making the viewers cry with melodrama. Most of the time it feels like spoon-feeding. Open your mouth, the emotions are coming! Let's take a bite whilst this every-sad-piano-song-ever plays on the background. 

The show does bring some interesting topics on the table, but instead of trying to do much with little, instead of developing
                  ...
the characters and playing around with all the good things the series already had, it starts expanding itself with irrelevances, 3rd parties and events so unnatural it felt like Hachimitsu no Clover S02 all over again. The focus always being on emotions, yet 0 emotional depth is present. 

The characters on the other hand are bland and make no sense whatsoever. Violet comes with different personality and reaction based to the current episodic plot. Emotionally dead, hysterically crying little girl, I AM A WAR MACHINE - CYBERNETIC ORGANISM - LIVING TISSUE OVER ENDOSKELETON. Just choose your favorite version. Mine was the one in episode 6 who liked stargazing. I wonder where that personality disappeared for the remaining episodes.

Gilber's brother makes even less sense. ""You will be my brother's dog."" And 3 episodes later ""There is no emotional bond between my brother and you."" Who wouldn't bond with their own dog? I don't get it. Does this guy hate dogs or what is he even saying. What a cunt. 

At the end of the day, Bialetto Evelugalden is a common drama series to this industry, and its saddest part is not the actual drama writing, but the waste of potentiality, the single thought about -not only how much better this series could have been- but how much better it should have been."

This is the most memorable quote that had gone through my mind whenever I watched Violet Evergarden, and led me to ask myself this question: how do you learn an emotion? 

Experience? Knowing its definition? Or perhaps... By writing letters for others? Thus is VE's answer.

Story: 7
I liked the novel, so obviously I liked the story. They did make me get worried with those original episodes at the start but later on they managed to adapt most of the best chapters. There are
                  ...
quite a few which are standalone: 5,6,7,10,11. The rest involved Violet and her co-workers. 

The first half didn't look that promising, but the second half improved a lot. I think it's because they put in a lot of her adventures in the second half, only involving Violet and the customer, which gave a lot more room for growth instead of being surrounded by the other workers. She's the type who learns fast when she's alone, you could say. Watching her change bit by bit  a girl from emotionless and to some extent irritating to one who is able to experience emotions was very enjoyable. 

The story is not unique in the sense that she's trying to find the meaning of ""love"", but as it unfolds she learns other feelings as well, and soon enough we don't get the ""I want to know the meaning of ""I love you"""" line.

Pacing has sometimes been a problem, for example episode 6, where I barely got to know about Leon. They could've done more but I guess you have to expect that when you've got less than 20 minutes to cover an adventures. But in most cases they provided us with the right flashbacks and details to get to know the customers well. 

The anime did remove parts of the novel which were pretty bad: I'll start with witchcraft, a giant battle axe almost twice the size of Violet. I just couldn't believe that she could maneuver the axe so well, before she even got those robotic arms. Glad they got rid of that. They also made Violet very pacifistic compared to the novel, which helped to emphasize her growth even more, but this was at the cost of making her fighting scenes towards the end of the series ridiculous, since she chose to go head on without weapons at all, but still managed to take them down.

Other reviews have pointed out the technological and cultural inaccuracies in VE, but personally it didn't affect me that much except maybe for those robotic arms which seem to be more advanced than one we have today... Rather, I was more annoyed by the battle scenes: a 14/15 year old girl fighting against trained soldiers, sometimes without weapons... I get that she is OP, but... the way her adventures unfold so conveniently at times was one of the main weaknesses of this show.

There were some parts of the novel I would've liked them to include, for example Hodgins was supposed to visit Violet quite a few times when she was in the hospital and that helped to develop a parent-child relationship. They kind of tried to fit it in in between the adventures, but I don't think it was sufficient. The other thing is Violet's origins. They didn't go deep enough on that, and made people think that she became emotionless because of her time in the army. 

Art: 10
This is probably the best part and what made VE get such high expectations.  The face expressions were great, the landscapes were great... If I was to point out the best ones, I'd say the scenes of the starry night (Ep 6), street lamps and the city of Leiden as a whole. I also liked the way they included flowers a lot throughout the series (especially Ep 5, you could see one almost very 5 seconds). The reason I'm mentioning this is because flowers are an important theme here: if you look at the names of most of the characters, they're all related to flowers.

""People’s names always have some sort of meaning."" —Akatsuki Kana (author of VE)

If I was to point out a negative... Sometimes, maybe this was just once, they put too much emphasis on scenes which didn't really deserve it. In Episode 4, when Violet was first introduced to the villagers, they suddenly went all out with the animation, including sudden gusts of wind and leaves dancing everywhere. It was amazing, but not really worth it.

Sound: 7
I liked the OP and ED, but that was about it. It didn't make me listen to it over and over again like Aimer's Ref:rain (best ED for me this season). The background music was alright, but they were often hit or miss: they would sometimes repeat it for too long and in other cases the music just didn't match the mood at all. But still enjoyable overall.

Character: 8
From the blind obedience to kill to the development of a conscience which can heal, Violet's growth was truly remarkable, with the difference between her past and present crystal clear. Her blunt and fearless character had often been an obstacle against her success as a doll, but as the series progressed she managed to use them in the right circumstances. Her military salutes, her formal language, her expressionless face... They all changed. This is what the novel couldn't provide, those subtle details that show signs of growth.

Only disappointment is the development of the other characters, especially Hodgins, Cattleya and Benedict. The novel lacked this as well, but I guess it was expected since so much was invested into Violet and her customers.

Enjoyment: 8

Overall: 8
Good, but not a masterpiece.

Would I recommend you to read the novel? Give it a try unless you hated this. But there are going to be differences, both good and bad.

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"*I wrote this review a while ago and decided to finally update it to MAL*

Violet Evergarden is a story of love and of lost, how do you cope with losing the person whose life filled your own? The playwright who mourns his daughter, the soldier who never came home, the little girl who lost her beloved mother but at the heart of it all though is the girl who wants to know the meaning of the words the major said to her ""I Love You"" the girl named Violet Evergarden. 

She can be described as someone with a slightly different sensibility to that of the
                  ...
normal person. It’s not that she doesn’t have these feelings it’s because she was in a environment where she didn’t learn these lessons in humanity. She possesses these emotions she just doesn’t know how to express them or understand the feelings of others yet but through the people she meets she finds how to improve herself and begins to go through these complex, heavy emotions but the pain she experiences throughout the anime results in her growing as a person and it’s truly beautiful to watch. 

""I know we said goodbye, but I didn't know. It was forever."" - Violet Evergarden

Violet Evergarden will always hold a very special place in my heart. No anime has truly touched me so deeply and made me cry so many tears but tears of joy, despair, empathy and so much more that this anime expresses. I got so emotionally attached to Violet and her pain in the search of understanding and accepting her feelings and things that can’t be undone/forgotten. Violet Evergarden in my opinion is a truly emotional masterpiece and I am eternally grateful to experience it. 

She brings hope and love to people.
She brings hope and love to herself.
How her letters can bring you so much

Thank you KyoAni for this masterpiece.

Hope you enjoyed this review :)"

                                      (4/13 eps)","Violet Evergarden, the anime that has been hyped for a year, has finally arrived with controversy and concern. Is it the masterpiece that’s deemed from most? Certainly not. That does not mean VE could not deliver. I’m not gonna try to defend the anime just cuz it’s KyoAni and it’s highly placed by many, but I will give credit where credit is due. So let’s get started.

There’s no doubt in my mind that VE is visually appealing and accompanied by a great OST. However, do the characters and plot live up to it? So far, it’s too early to say despite 4 episodes still out.
                  ...
But we can kinda take a guess at this point. However, I do find the setting to be quite interesting and how the characters act seem to be somewhat realistic. 

There’s many reasons why people can rant on about this series, and no, “It’s KyoAni” and “It’s Overhyped” aren’t some of them despite people using these as reasons regardless. Violet’s introduction left many questioned, many thinking “She’s not interesting.” “She’s Bland” or “She’s 1-Dimensional.” But to be quite honest, the fact that she’s uninteresting and bland means there’s room for growth, and anyone can figure that out considering this has been done quite a lot. The start of the anime really showcases violet and her imperfection. Monotone, Boring, Lacking. Which is all the more reason for me to look forward to the end result of her character after upcoming development. Sure, maybe the way it was executed or presented seems questionable, but what the hell do you expect from a child that's been practically raised in war, got constant blood on her hands, and kills people without batting an eye? Anyways, I believe there’s a bigger picture to this and that this sort of direction has a purpose. Or it could be just bad directing, but I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt.

I see no reason to give lack of growth or undeveloped as reasons to criticize characters so early on. It’s like people expect 14 episodes worth of developed from Violet in the first couple episodes. There’s reasons why developments exist, and it’s to further a character and make them more interesting as people would expect to see. However, it’s how they go about this development that makes me question the series a bit. The direction it’s taking can go either way, so we’ll have to see.

Like I’ve said, there’s so much room to give more proper development on violet’s character and the rest, but if it’s accompanied by mediocre writing, then this development would be half assed. Now the writing isn’t horrible for what it’s worth, but sometimes it’s hard to care about what dialogues these characters decide to use. There’s only a lack of substance since it’s still too early for its full potential to be known. So there’s really no “substance” to rate upon anyway. But that’s why although I’m not fond of the writing so far, I look forward to the conclusion and hopefully they successfully develop the characters enough for us to sympathize or to understand them much better. I think people expected this to be somewhat deep and thought-provoking. But this is somewhat a simple story about a girl trying to find herself. Just that it takes on a more dramatic approach.

Despite the inner contents of the series itself, it definitely does the outer contents right. To the art style, the character design, the colours and background, as well as character movement, which makes them feel more realistic and humane. Sometimes the interactions between characters are fun to watch as well.

I think that VE is one of those shows that needs time and a slower process to really form the bigger picture and its true purpose. Although the pacing seems...awfully slow, I wouldn’t go as for to deem it “boring.” For me, I don’t think that at all. It makes me curious for more and how they decide to execute the given scenarios and how each character grows from it. Sure some of the drama hasn’t been so impactful or meaningful thus far, but it’s been mentioned many times here that with enough time, I believe the drama then will carry more impact and weight than before. 

I don’t think people should try place this anime on some sort of pedestal because it’s simply KyoAni or it looks amazing. Violet Evergarden is FAR from perfect, but it’s also not horrible at the same time. It’s been mentioned before, I believe it’s one of those anime that requires time to be able to fully understand VE’s potential. So I recommend lowering your hype level of this series and treat it like any other show this winter, because you'll probably ruin the show for yourself if you don’t. Violet Evergarden doesn’t offer much but great visuals and soundtracks along with it. Look at what type of series it is and see if it interests you. I understand many people feel obligated to watch it because it’s solely KyoAni (Me Included tbh). But see if it truly catches your interest. If it doesn’t, then don’t bother. 

I think VE may carry a simpler story than one might think. Not insanely thought-provoking or riveting, but I believe that since this show focuses on Violet’s Character, we’d be able to go more in depth on her past life and her adventures later on. We will see Violet grow as a character as she learns from others’ experiences. That’s her job after all, to deliver letters to people and to fully express their emotions onto a piece of paper. 

Overall Violet Evergarden has caught my interest personally and although it’s hanging on the edge, I do hope that the staff finds a way to really bring out the full glory of the series into its full light and shows us a great series with fine narratives and well-developed characters (although sometimes the development is being dragged out a bit too much). Not sure why some of the side characters are original, but I suppose they add a bit to Violet's character.

Thankfully, I’ve learned not to give a damn about MAL scores a long time ago, because those “scores” used to influence me whether to watch something or not. I don’t give a fuck if VE ends up in the 6’s or low 7’s once this is over. If I enjoyed it personally and loved it, then that’s that. But again, my opinion on this can change easily. I’ve only read a couple chapters of the source material so I can’t really determine how well the adapatation is so far. But VE shows promise, it’s up to the staff to live up to the promises and opportunities they’re given. Both the OP and ED were beautiful and the OST's are just great, really not much to talk about there.

Overall (as of Episode 12):

Story - 7
Art - 10
Sound - 9
Character - 8
Enjoyment - 8

Anyways, I truly believe Violet Evergarden can come out as one of the best from Winter, dare I say year, if it’s done right…

                                      (9/13 eps)","I'll start by saying that after watching 9 episodes I was compelled to write my first review for an anime on this site. 

It's true certain aspects of a show can appeal more favourably to people depending on what they value. In saying that, I will focus on what this show does so well for me and why I consider it one of the best I've seen.

Story: 
The introduction of Violet can understandably come across as odd due to the monotone way in which she addresses other characters. This may be off putting to viewers as I've noticed in some other reviews, but this set
                  ...
up is to a soon to be deeper story is just that: a set up. From what seems to be an ordinary show with a simple premise, rises one with humanity and heartfelt emotion. The character Violet is the canvas and each one of her encounters adds another layer of life to her story. I respect the writers for having the capacity to create these memorable moments through subtle recalling of other plot points that makes the show feel tied together. On top of that the dialogue has this poetic nature to it, whereby it doesn't attempt to add unnecessary complexity but simply lays bare the message it wishes to communicate.

Sound:
There is so much I would like to say about the music of this show but I will keep it to a minimum. What music should do well in any show is add to the emotion the story is trying to communicate. VE does this exceedingly well, providing a different variety of sounds depending on the situation. There are those intimate moments where it's often accompanied by one or two instruments, and there are more intense moments accompanied by orchestra. Overall there's a large variety of well written melodious music, and it has to go down as one of the best anime soundtracks I have heard to date.

Art:
You only have to watch the first episode to understand the quality of the visuals, and I would have to put this anime in my number one spot for that department because it is truly beautiful. It's only after watching VE have I realised the full extent in which visuals and sound can make the watching experience better. The colours are vibrant and there is a consistency of detail in every scene which keeps your eyes fixated on the screen in awe. Detailed facial expressions make the heartfelt moments of the show much more impactful. There is also this tendency to cut to exquisite detailed sceneries whether it be the backdrop of a starry sky or a field of flowers. But it doesn't stop there because these moments are scattered across every scene, with the environment, objects and camera perspectives adding unbridled levels of detail. If I didn't like the story, I would still be looking forward to seeing VE because of how aesthetically pleasing it is for the viewer. I applaud the artists of this show for the work they have done, as you can see the amount of love and effort they have put into it. This show is an artistic masterpiece in it's own right and I have no problem making that claim to anyone.

Character:
I can't say too much without giving away plot points but the focus of the show is almost entirely on Violet, with additional characterisation given to those that appear from episode to episode. I have invested in this journey Violet is on, as I can see how her character grows each week as she experiences more of a beautiful world she has never seen. I believe that everyone who watches the show will relate to Violet in some way as we have all seen the world through the lens of beauty or wonder at some point, and we are all on a similar path of discovery. Episode 7 is a particularly memorable episode and is a contained story featuring just Violet and two other characters. Minimal characters and concise well-written stories allow this show to shine and provide something that many anime's take several episodes to build up towards. It is a bold attempt at providing viewers a sense of fulfilment in just over 20 minutes, and I can say that it has given me that almost every week. When I began VE I thought of it as something that was 'pretty' and had potential, but now I look forward every week to see where it will go next.

Overall:
The scores I am giving are based on what I have seen to date. If I was to review the first 3 or 4 episodes, certain scores would have been lower. Story for example, picks up significantly from about episode 6 and is now consistently outstanding in my opinion.

Overall Scores:
Story: 10/10 
Art: 10/10
Sound: 10/10
Character: 10/10
Enjoyment: 10/10
Overall: 10/10"

It’s a journey of words, words that hold the power to influence the future of a person and change their perspective about the world. Finding the right words for the dear ones isn’t easy and Violet learns that through her encounters with different people who have a story to tell.

The story is made with words, words on a piece of paper that can save a dear brother from despair, can show the love and carrying of a mother for her child even after she is gone, can make the parents understand
                  ...
what their child wants to do with his future, can connect two distant hearts that yearn for each other, can bring news of happiness or sadness to someone dear and finally can make people come to a mutual understanding. 

The letters that contain those words are the key to unlock the locket on people’s heart and break the iron shackles that put a restrain on their emotions. Each letter needs to be delivered to its destination because each written word represent the genuine feelings of its senders for the dear ones.Violet having a past filled only with cold words slowly starts to experience new words during her journey as a Auto Memory Doll, warmth words filled with compassion, affection, and love. Those words melt the ice around Violet’s heart and contribute to her growth as a human being. 

During her journey the world is filled with bitter words too not only happy ones but that doesn’t discourage her despite bringing back sorrow memories, in fact she comes to accept those words as part of her and grows stronger. She does her best every time to understand the meaning behind those words and give the right words to the persons in need of them. A sweet girl that lost the dear person to her on the battlefield, she stands up, raises her head from the ground, takes the first step and moves on in life despite the pain that weights a lot on her shoulders. I love you Violet!

The pace is slow fitting for our characters and Violet’s growth, because life isn’t meant to be hurried, each happy moment needs to be savored and each hardship needs to be overcome, life is a battlefield were each of us has its own fight, it’s all part of being alive. The emotional atmosphere combined with the subtle visuals and gorgeous ost  created around the character’s stories draw forth the raw emotions of its viewers and tears will be spend as an exchange.

Violet Evergarden is a letter of love addressed to life, a lesson about the hardships and happy moments in life, it’s about getting up and moving on despite the obstacles that await for you and it gets better after each episode like the taste of a wine as it gets better with age. Thematically rich, visually breathtaking with alluring ost Violet Evergarden is a gem that may be hated by many viewers or hold a special place in the hearts of its audience, can bring peace of mind and sooth your hearth, it’s a show that needs to be savored for its special flavor called LIFE.

As any journey that comes to an end it’s time to say farewell to our main heroine Violet who has reached her final destination but her fight with life will continue as long as she doesn’t give up, so my review of this enchanting show has come to an end. I wanna thank all of those who allocated a little of their time to read the words that I put on paper to create something that I hope will make a little change and give this show a try."

                                      (10/13 eps)","I was surprised when I saw the top 3 reviews for this anime were all negative because quite frankly I have nothing negative to say about VE and I'm on episode 10. If I'm being honest I think most of the people trashing VE are doing so because they want to be contrary and ""cool"" for not liking a popular anime. You know, the same old pretentious anime fans we all love (if you can't sense the sarcasm, you've misunderstood).

Story - 9/10

Violet is about a young woman who was used as a war machine having to learn how to live a ""normal"" life after the
                  ...
war ends. The series is episodic with the main overarching focus being on how Violet grows as a person. Maybe the only negative I can say about VE is that, yes, some episodes are predictable but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.

Each episode introduces a new character and their struggles, and ends with how those struggles get fixed or dealt with, typically with Violet helping to the best of her abilities despite struggling herself.

I'm not a big crier but I'll admit episode 10 made me tear up. VE has a wonderful way of making you care about characters and a story in just one episode. Kyoani always has pretty decent anime, but they really show their talent in VE. 

Art - 9/10

As per usual Kyoani delivers amazing visuals. Absolutely nothing worth complaining about here.

Sound - 8/10

Usually I don't pay much attention to music in anime honestly, but I will admit VE has a way of putting the perfect music to make sad scenes even sadder.

Character - 8/10

For one, I love Violet. The more the series go on and the more she grows, the more I want to protect her like she's my own child. The other characters could do with more development, but on the other hand since the series is episodic and has to spend time making you care each episode for a new story it's understandable our mains don't get much time themselves, but they all have wondrous potential. 

Enjoyment - 10/10

This is easily becoming one of my favorite anime of all time. That's all I have to say. Please don't listen to the negative reviews and watch VE for yourself. You will understand why I feel so passionately about this series.

Overall - 10/10

Again the only anime to ever get a 10 out of 10 from me and it's not even finished yet."

grotesque. 


Art & Animation: 10/10 (""Outstanding"")
The art is stunning and consistent with its pseudo-European world. Hard work has gone into to animating even the most mundane moments, adding brief glimpses of humanity to otherwise lifeless characters.


Sound: 8/10 (""Very Good"")
The Orchestral music is apt. Yet at times the music clashes with scenes, taking away from moments are best left quieter. Some of the best moments in cinema and animation have relied on sound effects over dialogue and music.
...


Story: 3/10 (""Poor"")
Some changes must happen when adapting a light novel to anime. Yet, the changes made in adapting Violet Evergarden are lackluster and timid. The writers must have recoiled when faced with a story that begins in medias res. (Lit. ""Into the middle of things"") So instead they altered the flow of events. Even if it was disruptive and even if scenes no longer made sense. 


Further, the anime has taken a complete departure from the adaptation. In fact, it would be best to say there is no central narrative. The directors have instead chosen to adapt Violet Evergarden as an omnibus. (By their own admission.) As a result, Kyoto Animation has opted to abandon foreshadowing. These changes have weakened the story on the whole. It has become something that is disposable and lacks character. Kyoto Animation's use of brute force and crude manipulation is unsuitable for a story about post-war recovery.


Characters: 1/10 (""Pathetic"")
As bad as the story is, the characters are worse. A weak story makes weak characters. The shuffling and omission of events make attachment to any character difficult. Violet's desire to learn what ""I love you"" means is too grandiose to empathize with. The scope is too far removed from reality to be the sole string which ties the omnibus together. So, each episode Violet manages to feel less and less human. 


To conclude, I find this show guilty. It is guilty of being bad despite the clear hard work and talent that went into it. In some ways Violet Evergarden is a bigger travesty than a bad anime which had no effort put into it. This show could have been great, but it isn't, and nothing after these first four episodes can repair it. This show is a solemn reminder not to judge a show based on the quality of its original content, animation studio, or appearance. 

My recommendation is to read the light novel, or watch Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu instead."

This quote perfectly sums up Violet Evergarden and what the show is trying to get across. After reading the synopsis of the show I was intrigued to see just how they are going to portray this type of character. In my opinion, they've done it almost perfectly. Knowing nothing but war, pain and suffering. Showing us how she finds meaning in these new emotions and how she experiences them for the first time.

Story:
Starting off with the story. We follow the journey of a girl named Violet Evergarden. Who has been in the army
                  ...
as  ""the weapon"" from a very young age. Knowing nothing apart from how to follow orders. The story starts in a hospital where we discover she was greatly injured in the war costing her both arms. When she wakes up we find out the 4-year war has ended and this girl who missed pretty much all her childhood now needs to discover emotions for the first time and so her journey begins to discover the meaning of these emotions. Although you might think the story seems pretty simple it's actually the exact opposite. With flashbacks to show what happened to her in the war as well as meeting new characters and dealing with new emotions with every person. This actually turns into a pretty complex storyline. 

Although the first few episodes may suggest this is a generic anime with stunning visuals I can pretty much guarantee that it's not. The story might also seem very basic to people but the way its executed is honestly astounding. You can really sense what the author is trying to get across in every scene. The studio really outdid themselves when trying to make every scene perfect. Each scene has something to be learned from... not just Violet but even the viewers can take away these emotions. You can find yourself emotionally sucked into the story within the first few episodes. Even if you don't like how the story develops you still want to know how she turns out in the end. Which just proves how excellent the story writing is for the show.

Art:
I don't believe there is a word to describe the visuals in this show apart from mind-blowing. It's stuff you would expect from a movie budget. I'm definitely glad they focused on the art in the show. It's needed to flush out some of the emotions the character is trying to develop. One example is in one scene she looks out on the city during a sunset. Now that scene wouldn't have worked at all without amazing art. It just wouldn't show why the character appreciates it. Now it's not just the environment that has amazing art the characters also have amazing detail even just people in the background. The show does an excellent job of capturing facial expressions since is especially needed when trying to convey new emotions across. The fact this show has 14 episodes and keeps this type of art up is honestly astonishing to me. I would honestly recommend the show just for the art. Best I've seen for the budget of a show.

Sound:
This part is definitely the weakest of the show. Don't get me wrong it's still good but compared with the writing and art it just doesn't compare. The show does still deliver excellent soundtracks and the voice actors fit perfectly for the roles for both dub and sub versions of the show. They perfectly express the emotions the characters are feeling. However, I feel like the soundtracks are more just background music rather than dramatic music helping to convey emotions. Although it's still better than must it just isn't as good compared to other shows.

Character:
The story is focused solely on the development of one character and that being Violet Evergarden. At least that's what you would expect. However, that's not the case. Violet has this tendency to change the way characters think and feel showing us great character development throughout every episode. With new characters being introduced for a short time and some long-term character which we can see progressively change throughout the entire show. One of my favourite things about Violet Evergarden. Now I don't know if it was done on purpose or just how I perceived it but she was given the personality of a machine. Knowing nothing but how to follow instruction and orders similar to computers. Then we find out both her arms are mechanical which for me was a massive nod towards her being a machine emotionally. This was amazing character design if it was intended. Her full character is based on being this good soldier knowing only how to follow orders and getting things done according to what was specified. Which is shown a lot in the show like typing at a certain speed when doing a letter. Then we begin to see her develop new emotions and rekindle ones she didn't know she had like love which is a major development in 14 episodes especially when she started with pretty much nothing just a blank canvas if you will.

Enjoyment:
This show definitely gives me amazing enjoyment looking forward to every episode each week knowing its going to be better than what I expected. Each episode brings old and new characters into the mix allowing for new storytelling and new emotions to be developed and sitting watching her develop these emotions is honestly so entertaining. I couldn't praise it more it keeps me coming back every week wanting to know what will she discover this week. 

Negatives:
Now there are a few things people may dislike about the show which will ruin there experience so here are the main problems people are having with it. The first major problem is the story feels dull and slow which can ruin some peoples experience so try to keep in mind this isn't a fast show. It likes to go slow and let the characters built up progressively rather than being rushed.

Another major point would be the character development which goes hand in hand with the story. It feels slow and underwhelming. Making people dislike the show straight from the first few episodes. So if you aren't a fan of slow shows I would suggest staying clear of this show or a least give the first 3 episodes a try.

Now my last negative point isn't too much about the show itself it's more for other people's comments on it. A lot of people were really hyped about this show and feel let down by its performance so far. I would suggest just giving the show a try regardless of what they say. Usually, if something is hyped up too much it just can't reach what people are expecting. So try to go into the show with an open mind and if you don't like it by the end of episodes 3 then its probably not for you. 

Overall:
This show is a much watch for any person looking to get emotionally invested in a show for a complex storyline. With amazing visuals and stunning character development. There are few negatives I can give this show apart from the pacing feeling off in some early episodes. However, this is soon fixed after a couple of episodes and we are left to completely get sucked into her world and what she will discover. If anybody is thinking about watching the show but not sure. Highly recommend watching until the end of episode 3. I think by that point you should have a clear direction for what type of story the show is trying to get across. This definitely has the potential to be the best anime this winter. That now concludes my review of the show. Feel free to add me if you want to comment on my review or discuss anything.Thanks for reading.

                                      (4/13 eps)","Violet Evergarden feels like the anime equivalent of Oscar bait. It's big and sweeping, trying desperately to convince you that its sappy story really means something, but it's ultimately shallow and entirely surface level. Everything that really matters, the meat of the story - its characters, its themes, its ideas - are so basic that it actually brings down the visual presentation. You're wasting this incredibly detailed art on this story, of all things? Why?

Violet Evergarden is a story about a girl who is some sort of superpowered golem woman (?) who somehow has just been given robotic arms (??) despite living in a setting
                  ...
where most people are illiterate and typewriters are still the new hotness (???). She was used as a soldier, but now she's a glorified traveling secretary, writing letters for others in the hopes that she can answer one nagging question: What is love? (Baby don't hurt me)

There are problems with this setup. The setting is a mess, and I have been struggling to try and get a grasp on it. I'm all for alternate reality settings based on Europe (Fullmetal Alchemist nails it) but the schizophrenic tech levels and people's relatively muted reactions to Violet's robotic arms makes it hard to get a sense of anything. There’s other weird inconsistencies, like a scene where characters apologetically bow in a Japanese manner or when a character gets Chinese takeout, paper box and all. Violet herself is also confounding, as the show has yet to make her origin clear, and while that might sound like the setup for a mystery, it certainly doesn't feel like one when every character seems to take her existence for granted.

Violet's character is also a major hindrance. If you've seen one ""robot wants to be human"" movie, then you've seen all she has to offer. She's dull and monotone and utterly uninteresting to watch because she’s got nothing else to her. I can literally summarize her character in two words: ""Muh Major."" The emotional core of her arc is her relationship with her now-dead Major, but it's hard to care when they seem to be dragging out Violet's discovery of his death and we only see him in quick flashbacks. His story seems a lot more interesting than anything going on in the present; it's a shame the whole show couldn't have just been set around him as he trained Violet.

She's a weak anchor for the show, and the rest of the characters around her are even worse. For a show that presents itself so ostentatiously, it's really jarring when all of her coworkers are immature, one-note anime cliches that could be from any generic shounen or slice of life show. There's no chemistry among the cast, either, so I have absolutely no interest in learning their ""deep and mysterious backstories"". Episode 4 was probably the best so far because it actually fleshed one of the cast members out, but her story was predictable and thin so it's not like it makes her all that much more interesting. If that’s the level of quality I have to expect from the rest, I’m not holding my breath.

You can have all the pretty visuals in the world, and some of these landscapes really are gorgeous, but if you don't have a good story or characters to carry it through, what's the point?

And actually, I do want to take aim at the story's visuals - or, rather, the directing. I don't think enough people are ragging on this point, but this is not a well-directed anime. There are so many laughably overwrought sequences that it feels as if the show is desperately overcompensating. I was giggling during the opening of the first episode when Violet's letter flies out of her hand and then proceeds to fly around the city in GRAND, MAJESTIC shots until we've apparently gone from the country to the motherfucking ocean. It's like the opening shot of the feather in Forrest Gump, except whereas in Gump that feather is a visual metaphor for the course of his existence, in Violet Evergarden it's just a way too obvious attempt to impress the audience.

Another galling example is in episode 4. Violet gives another character a curtsy. This is not an important interaction, she's basically just saying hi, and there is nothing pivotal about the moment. Despite the mundanity of the gesture, however, we suddenly get a million cuts and the animation goes into maximum overdrive as a massive gust of wind causes her dress to flutter like the show is announcing, ""This is the most important thing ever!"" It's completely over the top. Look, being over the top can be great, but it's all about tone, and it totally does not gel with the feel of that particular scene and the general ""serious"" tone the show so desperately wants to convey.

The directing is a mess because it never seems to know when to stop or when to pull it back. It’s as if the director is convinced that if you make it look epic enough, then you trick people into thinking it’s actually deep and resonant. Instead, it has all the emotional resonance of a fucking Michael Bay product.

And while I'm bitching, can I bitch about the soundtrack? The musical choices (big, blaring orchestras) sometimes come in at the most inappropriate times, or the music is mixed so poorly as to drown out the characters' dialogue. The ED is complete trash, and sounds as if the singer dared herself to perform the song entirely through her nose. From Kyoto Animation, who usually nail the soundtracks and sound designs of their shows, this is just baffling.

Ultimately, Violet Evergarden’s biggest sin is that it’s mostly boring. Everything this show has to offer has been done a million times better elsewhere. Even the “sakuga” isn’t all that enthralling because, in the end, it’s in service to nothing. I can appreciate moving wallpaper as a screensaver, but I’m not going to enjoy watching it for 24 minute chunks. I guess I’ll keep watching to see if it ends up going anywhere, mostly because I don’t want to think Kyoto Animation would fuck up this badly, but I certainly wouldn’t recommend this show to anyone else.

Maybe I’ll be wrong. Maybe it’ll get better. And maybe I’ll win the lottery and they’ll finally announce Nichijou Season 2 and Donald Trump will fulfill his campaign promise of making anime great again. Fingers crossed, everybody!"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"RANT WARNING: Too many anime fans, apparently, have become accustomed to having things spelled out for them via some combination of long narration and excessively expository dialogue between characters.

Along comes Violet Evergarden, a show that dares not to hold its viewers' hands, and suddenly there's a backlash mob complaining about how the ""dialogue doesn't tell us enough"" and how supposedly that's an indicator of weak story. 

It's laughably stupid, because the opposite is true. A great film/show is one that you can mute and still understand. A trash show is one where you could drape a blanket over the screen and still understand it. 

Violet
                  ...
Evergarden, even the haters will admit, is beautifully animated. Thank Kyoto for that. But what the haters seem to miss is that the animation itself is telling the story, which is HOW IT SHOULD BE. And it would be the norm if so many studios weren't sadly forced to operate on a tight budget that incentivizes them to give us boring stills while characters explain things for us. 

All I can say is WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING. Watch the subtle facial expressions, the changing scenery, the moods that the different color schemes convey. Stop expecting walls of text to spell everything out for you, and you'll find there's a beautiful, tear-jerking story here. 

Violet Evergarden tells the story of a broken, scarred soldier who needs to find her place in the world. 

She spent most of her life as a pawn who just took orders and wreaked havoc. She spends the course of the show learning how to express and get in touch with her own emotions. 

Of course, Violet's lack of emotions in the beginning can be a turn off for viewers. She is somewhat difficult to empathize with at the start. But that, it turns out, is the point, as this problem is remedied in a truly beautiful way. Starting around episode 3, Violet (and we the viewers) begins hearing the stories of more ordinary people. These stories are easier to understand, and when Violet herself is able to draw a connection between an emotion one of her clients is feeling to an emotion she herself felt at a certain time, it allows us to start ""getting"" who Violet is.

And that's when the freaking water works start. Bring tissues if you're like me. Starting with episode 4, almost every episode that followed brought me to tears at some point. It's a good, ugly cry that they get out of you. Kyoto doing Kyoto things.

This is among the greatest things I've ever watched. You may not like it if you're used to easily digestable shows that tell you what to think/feel and have characters constantly spoonfeeding you exposition. You probably won't like it if you're only into giant robot battles. But if you're ready for a show that will make you feel, there is no better show to watch."

Although I understand the sentiment of this anime being quite boring for the first 4 episodes (as all the top reviews have listed), this anime is a masterpiece by KyoAni, and although it doesn't necessarily live up to all the hype it received, does that really matter when enjoying a delightful anime?

Story: 10

Although the first few episodes are seemingly pointless, they do a great job at developing the idea that Violet really struggles to understand emotions. Although many side characters seem quite flat, they really help boost the story in one of the best climaxes of a coming-of-age emotional anime I have ever seen
                  ...
(if you are wondering, it's episode 9). Major Gilbert and Claudia really develop as characters, gaining dimension in episodes 6-9, and it is just a joy to see Violet grow and learn how to express emotions.

Art: 10

KyoAni. Do I have to say anymore?
But in all seriousness, have you seen the graphics? They are STUNNING, and boost the show in so many ways.

Sound: 9

The soundtrack is very wonderful, and the orchestral music is very moving. I just think that some of the music is lackluster compared to others. AMAZING ending song, though. Michishirube is so beautiful and emotional, and fits the show so well.

Character: 8

I can see where some may be turned off. Violet is flat and uninteresting in the first few episodes, but if you can take this as Violet just being inexperienced with emotions, all the flat main and side characters really develop. But I can understand why some may give bad ratings for this show having only watched 3-4 episodes.

Enjoyment: 10

This show is just such a joy, and I look forward to each Thursday when I can watch the next episode. Violet's maturing is so heartwarming, and the side characters slowly becoming accustomed to Violet gives this show so much charm. I really recommend this anime for its enjoyable nature, if not for anything else.

Overall: 10

If you can accept that Violet is just mot emotionally mature at first, this show becomes a feels trip and a beautiful, heart-melting anime that is worth every episode. Looking back on the first episodes, having watched later ones (especially episode 9), there is a feeling of satisfaction and happiness just seeing how cold and unemotional she was before, and seeing how well she grew. I absolutely recommend this anime to anyone looking for great music, visuals, and a charming story that will surely make you cry."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"“♫♫♫ When you try your best but you don’t succeed…
When you get what you want, but not what you need… ♫♫♫”

Emotions play a powerful part in storytelling; holding the capacity to tell more through expressions than words could ever hope to achieve. Furthermore, the degree of sentimentality and pathos one feels when watching is able to override any logical fallacies or flaws a story may have. Because of their poignant effect, these “feels” are often used and abused by anime to hide a plethora of writing problems underneath obvious emotional manipulation on the viewers. But whilst there are shows that come off mawkish and melodramatic,
                  ...
there are certainly those where sentiment is deserved. Violet Evergarden is the most recent anime that struck a chord with the community, practically built as a masterpiece before the first episode was even released and I could see why: an award-winning light novel getting an adaptation by Kyoto Animation – a studio adored for their gorgeous art style and animation – sounds like a perfect match to many. But does Violet Evergarden live up to its expectations? And, perhaps more importantly, is the emotional ride warranted?

Violet Evergarden follows a titular young girl whose purpose was to be nothing more than a weapon bred for war; a dog of the military, actions akin to a beast fighting for survival. She was never taught how to speak, write or communicate at all, only to kill. Treated as property by the military she was gifted to Gilbert, a major in the army who feels sorry for her, taking it upon himself to teach her valuable skills so that someday she may live the life of a normal girl. As time goes on their relationship grows stronger with her initial animalistic nature subdued and instead displays a more robotic-like behaviour in public. A romance between the two also brews, but their responsibility as soldiers of war takes priority and their affection for each other forced into stagnation. Unfortunately, war holds no mercy on the battlefield and results in Gilbert’s death. His last words: “I love you” – words that she doesn’t understand from the man who gave her the name of a wildflower in bloom, Violet.

The aforementioned acts as backstory to the main plotline that is not revealed until later, whereas the series begins with the aftermath: Violet is found in hospital, bed-ridden with prosthetic arms. The war is over and her purpose fulfilled, now she must adopt a civilian lifestyle. She meets Claudia, a former army commander who had befriended Gilbert during the war and is now president of a postal company that provides mail and ghost-writer services. Initially hired as a postal worker, she witnesses how the ghost-writer department works and wishes to become an Auto Memory Doll – a ghost-writer for those unable to write in order to learn the meaning of words and the feelings of others. The beginning is honestly a poor first impression, coming off sappy, predictable and acts as a shoddy introduction to each of the characters. Violet especially comes off almost insufferable here; her backstory is barely referred to with most of the details left in the dark, effectively throwing viewers into her moment of crisis without any proper context. It’s a perplexing choice on behalf of the staff, considering that Violet’s personality here leaves her a bland, dreary main character to follow from the start, lacking enough reason to care about her struggles to begin with. This is made worse with how the story begins at such a slow pace, making it hard to judge whether the show is worth continuing. However, Violet Evergarden is not a show that should be judged from first impressions, as there certainly is merit to be found.

Over the next few episodes Violet finds herself working and learning from other Auto Memory Dolls from their interactions with clients. The contrast between Violet and her fellow workers easily shows how far Violet truly is from her goal: currently emotionless and blank in her interactions, yet her desire and drive to understand the clients shines across the screen. This is further touched upon as Violet attends a training school and is unable to convey one’s feelings onto a letter. On her own, she is still unable to properly recognise emotions, but through those around her she slowly begins to grasp what they feel and how they express such. Here Violet’s bland personality acts like a blank canvas where those around her can leave their mark on her, allowing for parallels between side characters and herself to cause short instances of growth in Violet and a resolution on the side-character’s behalf. However, the show is never able to capitalize on these instances well. Rather than take adequate time and focus to let these small but important moments have appropriate build-up and climax to truly have a resonant effect, the show just treats them as merely parts of the plot that could very well be considered isolated from each other, devaluing each achievement Violet makes in her development as the show goes on. I personally found it appalling with how Violet finally learns to effectively convey feelings in an extremely short and concise letter, then not even a few episodes later she is extremely proficient in her writing. If only writing IRL was that easy ☹

It’s at this point where the pacing takes a sudden shift and the shows changes to an episodic format, focusing on Violet’s travels away from her workplace for different clients, each with their own set of issues to overcome, but all revolve around the idea of awakening their true feelings. As an Auto Memory Doll her job is to help her clients express what they feel, but here Violet sees the inner conflict present and aims for them to address and come to terms with it, with her acting as a catalyst when necessary. Whilst doing so, Violet continues to gain more appreciation for different forms of communication and gradually shows more signs of human behaviour. Her facial expressions able to tell more and more with each passing episode. It also gives a greater sense of the importance of society learning to feel again, accepting the tender aspects of individuals and its value. Relearning traits such as kindness, compassion and knowing how to best care about each other, so that when her time comes, Violet will be able to do the same for the own problems. Knowing this, these episodes should be lovely short stories to sit through, but that’s not the case. The way emotions are expressed here sound all well on paper, but in practice come off sterile – a “clinical” sense with how an entire spectrum of emotions are presented. There’s certainly logical reasoning behind why each feeling is portrayed, but as a viewer, these sensations are only being observed, never experienced. A sense of detachment always lingering beyond the screen, breaking any chance to bond with what is happening in the narrative. The series never tries to be melodramatic in its attempts of sentiment and I can respect that; through sheer visual flare it seeks to emulate like none before it, only to end up feeling artificial for the rest of the show.

It’s hard to get passionate about a series like this with such a lack of connection, but following Violet’s journey to self-discovery holds enough value that’s worth mentioning. Understanding her background and circumstances is crucial in understanding what Violet Evergarden is trying to achieve. She is initially a tool for battle, completely devoid of human emotion and understanding, simply bred to kill. It is only when she is away from the battlefield where she is aware of her apathetic nature and slowly starts to change. Her development can come off sappy, but it’s justified here in my eyes; slowly grasping how to sympathize and feel for others regardless of her actions in the past. It’s a war with herself, can her bloodstained hands really be used to help others? Is she worthy to? Constantly told she is on fire, it’s when she finally learns about her former lover’s death does the burning sensation set in and eat away at her soul. She gives in to despair and unsuccessfully tries to end her own life. Just when hope looks bleak, she finds a letter sent specifically to her. It’s her colleagues; they miss her. Violet decides to help deliver letters at night, and witnesses the people that anxiously wait for these letters. Cheerful, elated to receive words from those they care about, their emotions key to her understanding her newfound purpose as a ghost-writer. Her hands that destroyed so much – can now bring people together. While the supporting characters will come and go at the drop of a dime, it is Violet who blossoms through the show.

The production of Violet Evergarden is constantly praised for the exquisite animation and beautiful art design, both of which are well deserved. Kyoto Animation once again prove why they are one of the best in the industry and raise the standard for TV animation to new heights. Everything looks beautiful… almost too beautiful. The fluid animation, impressive character designs and attention to detail are all obviously here, but I would not consider it all to be a positive. Violet Evergarden draws a fine line between breathtaking beauty and over-stylization; scenes are “too overloaded” with their artwork and digital effects, with the first few episodes smothered in excessive brightness, chromatic aberration and filters than hinder the great animation on display. When a pen is dropped, it doesn’t just fall, it descends in dramatic fashion! It’s overwhelming. Part of the problem falls to the directing which is just blatantly amateurish at times, as if the man in charge is unable to grasp feelings himself. There’s a natural beauty to be found in subtlety when it comes to emotionally-driven shows that Violet Evergarden lacks. The need to present itself in such grandiose fashion manages to expose itself to how amateur the artistic choices taken are; techniques such as depth of field and time-lapse photography are used with the sole purpose being imitation to previous works that did them better. Don't get me wrong, Violet Evergarden still looks visually pleasing, but rather than a home-grown garden gleaming with a myriad of colourful flora, the flowers are plastic, and knowing such loses its lustre.

So, with having finished Violet Evergarden, my thoughts are as followed: I rarely laughed, I never cried and this certainly will not change my life, but there is value here worthy of one’s admiration. While it lacks on an emotional level to me, the intent is pure and still holds a sense of beauty that deserves to be seen. It’s a nice show one can easily sit through to pass time, but unfortunately I can’t say much more. It’s just a shame that for a story aimed at learning empathy, this message never reaches past the screen. For it desperately wishes to be as perfect an emotional experience can be, it’s the stories holding imperfections that have the most powerful impact."

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Sincere. If I were to describe Violet Evergarden with a single word, it would be just that, sincere. It is a slow burn slice of life that makes up for its lack of narrative complexity with earnest, empathetic drama. 

A child soldier for the past four years, Violet Evergarden begins her journey with no place in a world without war. Upon awakening after the war's final battle with extensive injuries and no sign of her commanding officer Gilbert, she is truly in a world where she does not belong. Growing up as a soldier has not prepared her for everyday life. Unable to speak without
                  ...
a militant vocabulary and a solute, it became clear that a civilian's daily life is not suited to someone with her inclination. She gets taken in by former Lt. Colonel Hodgins, Gilbert's friend, who now runs a private postal service. Upon her arrival at the office, she becomes intrigued by the Auto Memory Dolls branch. 

Comprised of young women similar in appearance to Violet, the Auto Memory Dolls transcribe their client's feelings into letters. These women may look identical to Violet in their opulent Victorian attire; however, their capacity to comprehend emotion far exceeds our heroine. Violet is coded as a person with a disability. In this anime's time-period, the Victorian era or World War 1, people with PTSD got treated as crazy. Instead of treating Violet's mental illness as a sign of weakness, this anime portrays it respectfully. The show asks us to empathize with her just as she empathizes with the people she writes letters for.

This understanding and Violet's metal arms divide them, a blunt metaphor for her robotic personality. The career of transcribing letters is entirely unfitting for someone who cannot express emotion. However, what Violet lacks in an expression she makes up for in audacity. With the desire to understand the words ""I love you,"" said to her by Gilbert before they lost connection, she undertakes the endeavor of becoming an Auto Memory Doll. 

Violet's struggle is frustrating at first, but intentionally so. Affected by an undiagnosed mental disability, merely learning how to transcribe a single letter becomes her first great challenge. Her abrasively blunt personality leaves clients dumbfounded at best but furious at worst, occasionally creating understated comedic situations and displaying how she can barely function in society. The fluid setting reminds us that this could be anyone's story from any time. Mental disabilities are undiscovered during this era. That's why those around her misunderstand her. As the viewers, we also mistook her personality as a quirk, angered by her robotic demeanor. Not only is she isolated from the world, she inhabits, but also from those of us who observe her story. This perspective on her character is what made me invested in her arc right away. Her visible turmoil motivated me to be patient with her, to give her the chance to grow at her own pace rather than one designated by us as unsympathetic onlookers. At any chance he gets, the director reminds us we must follow at Violet's pace. We get drawn into her mindset with the dense atmosphere and an abundance of metaphors not to feel put off from the initial slow starting speed.

The most potent example of visual metaphors in the early episodes is the vast negative spaces Violet gets framed in, extenuating her loneliness even more. Complimented further by the atmosphere; brought to life through the excellent use of lighting, shadows, and layered colors giving the world a painterly appearance. At first, this dejected tone is what caused people to become alienated from the series.

Violet Evergarden has a purpose beyond the detailed environments and impressive lighting; there is more to it than one may initially ascertain. Stemming from the core theme of emotions are vignettes, a single story for each episode after the first two introducing the setting and Violet's life circumstance. The first of this episodic structure follows Violet taking classes to become a qualified Auto Memory Doll. Beyond her trained talent at calculated work, she falls short of her class's rest in expression. Violet's teacher does not accommodate her mental disability, forcing a friend to step in and help her to pass school with an unusual teaching method. A reminder to us, the viewers, that it's hard for some people to communicate their emotions; not everyone can conform to the typical education system.

A gripping realization that the world does not make it easy for us to communicate exactly how we feel. From this story of learning onward, we would come to see Violet gain more understanding of connection. Through the many clients she writes for, she grows gradually from robotic to self-aware. Through helping others, and in turn herself, she becomes a character embodying purely peace rather than the horrors that formed her life. Seeing Violet's life through the perspective of a young woman isolated, misunderstood, and struggling to conform to a society with no place for her, forms a visible arc throughout the entire series. 

Through merely observing different connections like familial love, romance, friendships, and more, the puzzle pieces of human emotion fall into place in her mind. This enlightenment comes quietly and gradually, but one of the most satisfying character arcs I have witnessed. In the beginning, she is a tool for the army taught to slaughter their foes mercilessly. In the end, she becomes a bringer of love with her letters. Like how the flower grows from bud into full bloom, she grows to be suited to the name Violet. Though simplistic, the artists often use flowers to symbolize her gradual humanization.  

The clients she writes for have drastically more emotional lives than her, highlighting how lacking Violet is. Over time, her demeanor rises to approach those of her clients in emotion. A change is most visible in how she speaks bluntly, never mincing words at the start and becoming subtler, and understanding how others feel by the end. A series so drama-focused as this got inevitably accused of being melodramatic, which is a fair criticism. Suppose you are only absorbing drama instead of analyzing the rich subtext; your experience may become tiresome. For me, this was never a hurdle to overcome. I loved following the trail laid out for us while devouring the drama at its most impactful moments.

None of this would be possible without compelling characters, but thankfully there are plenty in this series. Each with an intricate, freely moving character design, being in varying stages of life, and of course, a problem in need of Violet's elegant emotion transcribing. The many different characters are woven together in the same quilt, each with a dramatic life experience forming their personality. A personality that is satisfyingly deconstructed when Violet enters their lives. Seeing the various side characters have their inner turmoils put on display, then examined by Violet's blunt manner of speaking is incredibly cathartic. Her specific criticisms or encouragements of her client's personalities, unfiltered by concern for their reaction, create many satisfying moments of self-realization. Of the many characters, the protagonist receives the most development. Her inner turmoil is enrapturing. She was grappling with her bloodstained past and peaceful present, switching between gory flashback and elegant transcribing within the span of a single episode. Once we finally understand what experiences crafted her robotic persona, it is supremely satisfying after all of the misunderstandings she has endured. Viewing the series week by week only enhanced this more; the hate fired at Violet finally turning into understanding added more impact to these final episodes of realization.

These episodes wrought the most cathartic moments sheerly through the long period it takes to build up. Her new peaceful life feels haunted by the horrific deeds she committed in the past, shown with flashbacks, without knowing how cruel she was until becoming an emotionally comprehensive Auto Memory Doll. Throughout the series, she questions if she truly deserves to be writing letters of love rather than killing, even considering suicide in one of the series's most heartwrenching scenes. In the end, her self-doubt takes the shape of a full episode flashback, and others dispersed near the climax. The flashbacks showcase the base version of Violet, a pure killing machine who only takes orders. Booming explosions resound, overpowering any spoken words, pure chaos of fire and blood a perfect metaphor for the silencing of understanding the war causes. At the center of the cacophony lies Violet, like an angel dragged from heaven onto the hellish battlefield, wielded for evil by the morally bankrupt military. 

Through these difficult moments, we learn who she was at the very lowest point of her arc, emboldening the journey she has taken by now. This understanding we and Violet gain gradually is brought into the letter-writing vignettes, making them even more emotional. Most notably, the tenth episode's story is compelling for its placement in the story and creating a powerful display of emotion that anyone could relate to. It presents the audience with the routine vignette set up, a person suffering from an unclear turmoil needs Violet's work, but this story is more effective thanks to its placement at an advanced stage in her arc. The narrative presented is admittedly predictable and straightforward, but what mattered was Violet's new minor mannerisms that cued us in on the fact that she understood her client's situation much more. She could use subtlety with them, and we could pick up on how, but most rewardingly, we could pinpoint where she gained those little mannerisms in her arc. In the tenth episode, rather than being unable to express much emotion, she visibly buries her feelings for the tragic scenario she had to assist with, only gaining reprieve when the job is over. And I'll admit, I wept just as she did. 

Many viewers will not have such a wonderful experience, primarily because of slow pacing and reliance on visual storytelling. For a narrative as ethereal as Violet Evergarden's, you may find yourself tying it down with criticisms of shallow writing—this is simply the atmosphere of the show. Unafraid of the slow pace necessary to convey its lead's quiet emotions, accompanied by soft orchestral music, perfectly parallel to the story's direction. Every moment in this series is with purpose; nothing lacks meaning, but of course, whether you appreciate this meaning is up to you. The story highlights only moments necessary for conveying an emotional connection. Forming a vision of a character, typically archetypal seeing as they're typically only present for an episode, then crafting a vague image of their circumstance to which warrants a letter, then the execution.

Following the recipient reading the letter, Violet transcribed a deeply resonant display of emotion in many of the episodes. The impact only increases as Violet expands her abilities from her initial one-sentence letter to the inevitably most elaborate expression of emotion in the finale. The music rises to ensure the moment hits with as much impact as possible—with an equally melancholic ending theme to carry the feeling through the credits, sung with a subdued voice similar to Violet's voice.

Violet Evergarden has some of the best visuals in an anime series to date. Moreover, it deserves praise for is the power it has to convey empathy. Not merely a surface-level emotion, striking a connection with the audience. Always it conveys a universally applicable message: The key to a happy life is being understood and understanding others."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"Violet Evergarden was one of the most anticipated anime of the winter season, with its stunning promotional material showcasing beautifully animated scenes and character designs. It could be said that in that regard it was amazing and lived up to expectations. However, when it comes to the characters and overall narrative, sadly it isn't nearly as good as it could have been. The main problem can be associated with a lackluster cast of characters in combination with a seemingly aimless narrative.

The anime is based around Violet, a young girl that knows nothing else than war: when the Great War ended, she was left with no
                  ...
other option than to adapt a civilian life. By joining the Auto Memory Doll postal service, she will embark on a journey of self-discovery. Quite an interesting premise so far right? The different travel destinations the protagonist undertakes, offer each a diverse story of the client and their needs, while simultaneously developing Violet. These serve to shape the setting, as well gaining an understanding of the sociopolitical climate the story takes place in, helping viewers immerse themselves. Sadly, for a Victorian setting, Japanese customs are too prominent, making it a bit harder to engage with the narrative. In addition, the various stories on different episodes are quite predictable and cliché - some good, others not as much. Lastly, the narration lacks in continuity, and therefore coherence,  as each episode jumps from one story to the other. As standalone episodes, they work, but as a package, it needs more context.  One such example is where a character of apparent importance is introduced to the viewer, making them wonder what will happen next, just to fully ignore said character for the following episodes. This leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially considering that the episodes, in general, feel slightly random. These aren't necessary issues, as characters play the most important part in Slice of Life/Drama anime, yet somehow they were lackluster as well. Allow me to elaborate.

First of all, the main character is bland and boring, robot-like; which is not counterproductive in such cases (when done correctly), since that is the whole point of the anime. However, character development of Violet was done poorly, where the actions she performed felt forced, often falling back on her main motivation to do this ordeal in the first place, which may appear as a cheap copout. Another slight problem is that she seemingly gains emotions, then to suddenly just lose them for the convenience of the plot. It could be argued that it is natural for an emotionless human being, although personally, I'd disagree, especially when taking into account how little it does to the plot. In addition, little effort is made to make her a likable character, whether it be through interactions with her surroundings or just some simple characteristics of her that could be expanded on.

Protagonists aren't necessarily the foundation of a character-driven story: secondary/supporting characters can fulfill that role too. Disappointingly, it even fails in this regard. The whole cast is generic as it can get, with not a single interesting personality to root for - they simply lack identity. Character interactions with the supporting cast are scarce, and when done, lack meaning. The anime tries to flesh these out with the limited screen time they get, but quite frankly, it leaves much to be desired. Admittedly, there are a few background stories that could be relatable to the audience, whether it be the reason why people work for the sake of working, or how people regret things only after they lose it. As a whole, the character dynamic problem lies in Violet hardly having any meaningful relationship with any of the cast, making hard to invest oneself. Such dynamics are not a necessity since, for example, Mushishi manages to do this perfectly.

Animation wise, Violet Evergarden is stunning as mentioned earlier: after all, it is done by KyoAni, a studio renown for its gorgeously animated scenery and character designs. The studio makes good use of close-ups (whether it be objects or actions of the characters) to emphasize the meaning of the scene together with the different emotions it wants to evoke. The used color palette works great for the format, although it must be mentioned that the occasional grey filter that is applied feels unnecessary. The opening and ending are beautifully drawn and shown, albeit offering little addition to the anime. 

The voice actors did a good job on their respective roles, including the monotone voice for Violet that embodies her character - anger, despair, sadness, and exhaustion were conveyed in a graceful manner, although in some in instances it felt forced. As for the soundtrack used, it is befitting of the anime with the use classical instruments, such as the violin, piano, etc. These are reminiscent of Ghibli-like works, which I personally am a fan of. It does a fantastic job to immerse the viewer into the story of this Victorian like era.

Violet Evergarden as a whole was a beautifully animated work but lacked considerably in the most important parts, characters and story, causing a significant clash in immersion: the characters made it hard to feel engaged in it, while the animation and sound work invited to do so. For a slice of life anime, it fulfills its purpose, yet for a supposed story of self-discovery, it is arguably dull. This doesn't necessarily mean its bad/unwatchable; it simply could have been more than it ultimately was, since, despite all the issues mentioned in the review, I found myself enjoying the whole journey. All in all, Violet Evergarden had potential, but its shortcomings made it your average seasonal anime that comes and goes, just to be forgotten.

Thank you for reading."

                                      (5/13 eps)","I will admit I was on the fucking hype train on this anime, like full force going Crunchyroll's ""Anime of the Year"" when it wasn't even released yet. Now after a solid year of waiting, I was giddy as a 5 year old to see a story that was full of nail-biting moments and action. But no, what I got was a simple story of a young woman trying to understand the society she was denied by the war as a child and a quest to find love.

It may sound like a cheezy overused plot point, even more so in a high budget anime like
                  ...
this, but it's not. This is a character-driven anime. At first glance, Violet may seem like a boring MC, emotionless, robotic and stale, but in my opinion, watching her develop slowly into a more understanding person is so interesting. In this case, the blandness contributes so well to the other characters all in a way where they are helping her find the truth she deserves, about love. 

The art style and soundtrack of this anime are just beyond words, KyoAni's best work by far imo. Character-wise, they do not really have amazing traits that stand out, all in the fact that it contributes to the show's simplicity. But the main personality is Violet's. she has to put this show on her back as it progresses, watching her grow while she handles tough situations is gonna be one hell of a ride.

I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't watch this show, even if you are not a fan of simplistic shows, just stay for the visuals, you won't be disappointed."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"The most hyped anime of Winter 2018 and one of the most hyped of the year, Kyoto Animation's Violet Evergarden took the season by storm as fans were bewitched by everything about it from the trailers and beyond. And while many fans might have tons of love letters to describe the beauty and painful realism of this show to their daily lives, I sadly have to leave a different kind of letter for this show. A letter that this show and its fans might not enjoy reading from me.

Story (0.5/10)

Violet Evergarden is mostly episodic where Violet will visit her client and help them with ghostwriting.
                  ...
A simplistic concept but something that could easily work if done right.

When I heard of this before the show started, I thought that it'd be great and very interesting. But alas, having expectations that are high for any show like this always seems to bite me in the ass because instead, I felt that the story was just a giant flop.

Drama is a genre I love so much. It's a genre that when done naturally and organically, creates storylines that sends chills down my spine. Like the character-drama that is March Comes in Like a Lion which was airing its 2nd cour for its 2nd season at the same as this. What makes the drama fantastically written there is how methodically and organically the approach for it was. It wasn't a show trying to force drama down my throat each and every episode, it was a show that built up Rei Kiriyama's psychological issues and showcased his progression along with the Kawamoto sisters so well that the drama only adds magic to its storylines.

Hell, shows that have the best drama for me mostly, are shows that don't even have drama in the first place when you hear about the synopsis and just bite into the show. Like with A Place Further than the Universe which was airing this season, a show with four girls striving to travel to Antarctica and accomplish their respective goals. You have them bond with each other, create memories, and sprinkle in elements on drama here and there and it's all good. It develops the characters in such a great way that payoffs for Shirase and Hinata, and everyone's character arcs pay off massively and the storytelling is a huge success. This season has had some prime examples of how the genre 'drama' can be done right, and can create a compelling experience like no other. But the show that everyone focused on this season was the Kyoto Animation show, Violet Evergarden, the show that failed in nearly every way of creating any sort of compelling storyline whatsoever, or story that got me feeling any sort of emotions for these characters.

Why? Cause Violet Evergarden is STUFFED TO THE BRIM with drama that get quickly resolved in certain ways, therefore alienating me and making me not care for any of it whatsoever.

It's a show that's just pure Oscar-bait. A show that tries to showcase different situations in an episodic format, each designed only to emotionally manipulate people into feeling sorrow for them. I love episodic shows, but the problem with implementing stuff like this into these kinds of shows, is that you only get 20 minutes to create all these new characters, create a new situation and try to emotionally grab me right from the getgo with some bullshit with no depth or real organic development whatsoever. Everything just happens and I'm expected to feel anything for these characters, what utter nonsense. With no real time or earnest effort to write, why should I care for them if the writing isn't able to get me emotionally attached to them in a small period of time.

I won't say it's impossible to create emotional content in an episodic format, since the original Kino's Journey for me managed to do that. Albeit not with every episode, but that's the beauty of it for me. It doesn't try to force down philosophies or drama down our throats so when unexpected tragic events do happen, or when bad events do occur that make me irritated or sad, it works really well. In a short space of time, they're able to build genuine character interactions at a nice pace without feeling heavy handed and when something sad happens in an episode, it works. AND IT'S NOT EVEN A DRAMA SHOW.

HELL, you even have comedy shows that organically develop characters over time and the drama just works there too like with Assassination Classroom, Gintama and SKET Dance just to name a fucking few. It's not hard as long as you can do it properly without intentions to MAKE people cry from the start itself.

But Violet Evergarden feels way too unnatural, way too heavy handed and way too plastic on the surface and even below it that the concepts that it has for episode just fails to click. From it's original material to even it's horrendously written filler, Violet Evergarden's storytelling is an utter manipulative flop with horrendous pacing too.

Plus take away the melodrama, and it's just fucking boring. Nothing really interesting about the world, setting, the job and everything else about this show.

Characters (0.5/10)

Violet may have a cute design, but is such a watered down character that because of its poor writing, gave me absolutely no reason to care for her development whatsoever since all her interactions that made her supposedly develop were so fake and ingenuine for me. If you have to rely on trying to shove melancholy down my throat for 24 minutes for 13 episodes, don't expect me to feel any care for the characters whatsoever, especially the main character here.

Side characters had absolutely no one for me that I liked. Everyone might as well be mannequins since their personalities resembled that.

Art & Animation (10/10)

Very well done, although the drawings do look heavy handed at times. The animation clicks really well and works really smoothly in creating a cinematic experience like no other and even though the lighting maybe too bright for me, I'm still overall impressed by the visual production for this show. The designs, drawing, movement all look fantastic and top-notch for a TV anime. Shame it was wasted on a substanceless show like this.

Sound (8.5/10)

I liked the OP song a lot by TRUE, well sung and feels right at home with a show like this. And the OSTs do work very well with presenting the show with its own sort of magic and fantasies involved. It sounds very good although again, a bit forced too. Less is more for me at times like these. The voice acting was solid too for both Japanese and English versions.

Enjoyment (1/10)

I hated every single minute of watching this show, since there's nothing real about it. Everything's just forced, manipulative garbage that has nothing else to really add to the show to help make the stories work.

Major letdown, and a major stinker. What a horrendous show this was, and a disgrace to the ""Drama' genre as a whole.

Source material of this series is the winner of the Kyoto Animation Award 2014 in the novel category. Given that status, this series became the most awaited anime by the community for the winter of 2018. Compared to other series of the season, this series can be said to have the best animation, something that is expected of the anime from Kyoto Animation. With the premise offered is the post-war recovery of the main character, this series becomes one of the drama series that is able to fill
                  ...
us all with feelings

STORY : 8/10
I never read the source material of this series so I judged the storyline of what was shown in the anime. The premise offered is actually interesting. Self-rehabilitation of Violet who was created only as a weapon of war without having the slightest feeling and desire. But since the Major gave the last sentence, she began to look for what the meaning behind that sentence by becoming an Auto Memory Doll. Walking to one place to another meets the client's request. The journey unknowingly begins to make herself understand the feelings of a human being. The problem of each client who wants to pour into a letter is that slowly build the character Violet for the better. Until finally he understood the loss of someone and began to understand what it means to love. From a soldier who moves only if given the command to a human being who can shed tears. An interesting premise for a drama series derived from the light that lately is mostly filled by isekai genre

DIRECTION : 6/10
This series begins its story from  Violet's condition after the war and what she will do to find the meaning of the last sentence of Major. Then entering Episode 2-7 the direction of this series turns into episodic. Violet goes somewhere to answer client's request. Each episode is actually presented with the client's first point of view instead of Violet as main character. Every client has their own problems and from this problem Violet's character grows more human. With the direction of this story. Not everyone will understand how Violet character develops every episode. In fact, we will focus more on the client's problem. For example when most of us cry at the end of episode 10, but maybe many of us are not aware of the Violet character changes at that time. Episode 8-9 direction changes back to focus on the major plot. The transition from episodic episode clients to major episodes that has linear progress is poorly executed. I'm sure not everyone can understand how the story of this series if not paying attention to every sentence and scene with care. That was disturbing me in enjoying this series.

CHARACTER : 9/10
Violet Evergarden is a character with the greatest development among all the characters that exist in this season. Starting from a soldier who even just to eat should be given orders by Hodgins to be a human being who is even determined not to lose the life of someone as she once did. The thing that I love about Violet's character is that she develops not because she is being advised by others, but she learns by listening to the client's problem. she began to understand a feeling precisely after knowing what problems hers client was experiencing. So after knowing facts that ""facts"". She understands the meaning of losing someone. The scene in episode 11 when Violet performs the ""last request"" of the soldier also shows how she began to understand the meaning of affection. Perhaps what she's been doing lately is naive. But it shows that Violet has changed from a heartless weapon into a human who understands the sense of losing someone.

ART : 10/10
This series is a series with the best animated quality in winter of 2018. My favorite scene of course when Violet tried to pass the lake using an umbrella. The scene really shows the high quality animation presented by Kyoto Animation. The character design and color selection in this series reminds me of the Koe no Katachi film which is also made by KyoAni. Even for a television series, Violet Evergarden has the same quality as Koe no Katachi. Each frame is well drawn so the animation runs smoothly. Details on the character design also shows the hard work of key animators in making this series. Every female character feels so beautiful and every male character feels so manly through the way key animator draws each character. The selection of colors taken fits perfectly with the theme of this series which is thought to be similar to the period after the second world war in time and technology. Plus the quality of backgrounds such as clouds and water are so beautiful to the eye. Overall, this is one of the best quality anime other than Kimi no Na Wa and Koe no Katachi

SOUND : 8/10
Maybe what makes us sad and cry when watching this series is not because of Violet's personal problems, but the client's problem. But still this series still able to make us shed tears. The existence of the soundtrack in every sad moment in this anime really strengthens the atmosphere. Without proper selection and soundtrack composition, sad moments are not necessarily can make us shed tears. It also should be appreciated is the sound effect. Especially when the scene is related to the war. The sound of weapons, bombs, airplanes or even the sound of a soldier dropped from a shot. My favorite part in terms of sound effects is when an army is shot. Everything feels so fast that we do not realize that someone has been shot.

Overall, this series provides  best animated quality and also provides an interesting story premise. But direction in this series can make us confused in following Violet's journey to find his true self. So not everyone will judge the story in this anime executed properly or not. But for a drama series. This is an anime with good character development. Violet is the character with most massive development among all the characters in the winter of 2018."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"Violet Evergarden game out in 2018 to near universal acclaim from the online anime community. The premise is…kind of odd. The main heroine is an ice cold, killing machine with supernatural abilities and amnesia. Sounds pretty anime so far. However, her country is now at peace and her days of slaughtering faceless mooks are over. So, she decides to get a career ghost writing love letters in order to learn what love is like. The way to get a 9.00 rating on MAL is apparently to mix Elfen Lied with Cyrano de Bergerac.

What this anime is actually about though is a robot created solely for
                  ...
combat learning to become human and develop a heart. Have you seen Terminator 2? Have you seen the Iron Giant? Good, you’ve basically seen Violet Evergarden! My favorite version of this character journey is the Xenosaga trilogy in which the battle android Kos-Mos develops over 3 games and 90 hours of play time. The Nietzschean undertones make it more unique. Not only is she becoming a real girl, she’s becoming an ubermensch who thinks entirely for herself and creates her own values. The last game BTW is called “Also Spraque Zarathustra” because subtlety. 

This Pinocchio story archetype of a non-human becoming human and gaining a heart is quite old and has had a long-lasting appeal. There are parallels to the journey every child takes in growing up and learning right from wrong. The anime never explicitly states that Violet is a robot, but it’s pretty heavily implied. Even if it turns out she’s an alien or bio-weapon it’s the same journey. Personally, I’d rather follow a character journey more like the ones in Vinland Saga and Berserk. Those 2 main characters grew up as child soldiers and were treated as tools of war, but they were always human underneath. They forcibly repressed their emotions and their conscience in order to survive and keep killing people, but they always knew how wrong it was. Young children don’t have firmly established morals yet, but they don’t think like computers. I’d rather watch the journey and development of a human being than a computer because I’m a human and I’m biased.

Despite all I’ve said, I’m not going to be as harsh on this title as most of the Metacritic club was. There’s no point, since this isn’t actually a terrible anime and it’s not my job to sink this show’s reputation. 2,300 years ago, a rabbi who wrote under the pseudonym Kohelet, stated that “there is nothing new under the sun”. This statement was true then and continues to be true now. While Violet Evergarden’s character journey is one that covers well-trodden ground, that doesn’t make it bad! For many on MAL, this was their first exposure to this story and we old farts must respect that and understand how they feel.

“Human! My sensors indicate that you’re under some type of emotional distress. My instructor taught me a song. If you’d like to hear it, I can sing it for you. It’s called Daisy.” – Waifu 9,000

So how boring is Violet for the first half of the series? I think the HAL 9000 might actually have more personality and likeability. Violet feels like she’s not even an AI, but a robot we could build right now. Violet is like a hot version of the annoying robot in a trashy OVA called Cyber City. “Your welfare is one of my primary programming directives” Me: “Yeah, well my welfare requires that I get away from you!” Our male hero is some military asshole who falls in love with Violet during the time that she’s a soulless robot who executes basic command files and that’s it. Oh, and he believes she’s 14 years old based on her appearance, so there’s that too. None of the other characters get much development, so if you don’t love our main couple, you’re SOL. The main girl from Chobits was an android, but at least she was an actual AI! She showed fear, joy, concern, and demonstrated empathy right from the beginning. Since the main character is a country bumpkin with no experience dealing with women at all, it’s believable that he would fall hard for her. 

So now that I’ve written about the plot and characters, let’s look at the animation. Kyoani is one of the most beloved studios out there and for good reason. They typically do a phenomenal job and put so much passion into their projects. Violet Evergarden was the first effort of its director, Taichi Ishidate, and it shows. It has an odd mix of cel shading and CG that looks fine sometimes and rather off-putting at others. Compare this with Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, which Kyoani put out the year before Violet under the leadership of the late Yasuhiro Takemoto. It sticks to a visual style that it’s comfortable with and it looks a LOT better for it!

I normally don’t cover character designs in my reviews, but I can’t help pointing out what looks like egregious plagiarism on the part of Violet Evergarden. The heroine Violet looks WAAY too close to Saber from the Fate/Stay series. I spent the entire series waiting for Violet to randomly bellow out “You speak to Arthur Pendragon, King of the Britons! Sovereign of all England!” There are only so many ways to draw a cute anime girl but come on! It looks like they just blatantly ripped off one of the most famous waifus in all of otakudom! This isn’t generally a problem that plagues modern anime. It’s not like the heroine in Arte is a carbon copy of Rei Ayanami. This is specifically a problem with Violet Evergarden!

Overall, this series is fine for what it is. If I were younger and in the right mood, I could definitely see myself liking this series. If you loved Violet Evergarden and it spoke to you in some way, that’s awesome! If it made you feel strong emotions, those are your emotions and that’s perfectly valid. Just because some cranky old man on the internet didn’t love it shouldn’t hurt your personal relationship with the series. I’m not sure I would actually give this one a recommendation, but it’s on Netflix and is widely available if you want something to binge from the comfort of your living room!"

The alleys are filled with a comfortable bustle like they used to be; people’s faces don’t display a worrisome gloom anymore.

During my time working here, I have come into contact with many of the aforementioned dolls; and one of these women in particular piqued my interest: with her elegant, golden hair and doll-like demeanor, she fits the job perfectly, and she used to act the part just as well. However, what interested me about her the most wasn’t her looks but rather the fact that she had many stories to tell, be it from house calls or other, similar events.

To be honest, the stories themselves weren’t all too intriguing. It may be because I’ve lived through several years of war, but many of them felt like something I had heard before, had seen before. While the fates of these people are definitely cruel and while I really wish they had met a better fate, I can’t help but think of the many who have fallen in war. Thus, the stories of these people whom I’ve never met don’t leave as much of an impression on me as they might have used to; while hearing this beautiful woman describe equally beautiful sights and sceneries brings with it a certain feeling of tranquility, they aren’t what makes these stories interesting.

What does make these stories interesting aren’t the stories themselves, but how they affect the one experiencing and—later—telling them. She used to be a child soldier unable of speaking, reading or human emotion. Trained as nothing more than a weapon of war, her doll-like demeanor stems not from indifference, but her time as a soldier. Due to her unusual character, she ran into trouble trying to extract the emotions out of the client’s words, but over time she learned how to understand these feelings and, most importantly, how to feel, herself. 

Sometimes, upon reciting what had happened just a few days prior, her feelings slowly welled up inside, to then finally overflow. Suddenly, she learned how to smile, laugh and cry; she learned of emotion and empathy.  These unadulterated feelings coming from someone formerly unable to feel moved me to my very core every time; it was during these everyday epiphanies of hers that I felt like I was really watching something grow, giving shape to a human rather than a husk.

However, newfound feelings are both a blessing and a curse. They may make life more interesting and worth living, but at the same time they can accumulate and overwhelm a person—even more so someone hitherto engaged in the cruelty of war as she was. After realizing what she had done, she slowly gave in to sadness and sorrow. Her cold, metallic hands that killed so many, her blood-stained self burdened with guilt—they started a fire, engulfing her. Her state of mind turned into a complete chaos; she decided to strangle herself with her abhorrent hands and end it all, but she failed.

What saved her was a mere letter, this one sole letter I slipped through under her door. Filled with the feelings of her colleagues who missed her dearly, this letter saved her from her sorrow and herself. It let her reflect on what she had done: both her misdeeds in war and her profession, which brought together and still connects so many. Her actions might be irrevocable—but that isn’t a bad thing. Her burn marks may never heal, but really, they don’t need to. After realizing this simple truth, she learned to accept herself and finally became a complete person.

Looking at her now, I can’t help but feel a somber sadness. Her metallic hands that killed so many and her brooch which reminds of the loved one she lost in war—they make me feel melancholy. Just like the eponymous flower, Violet Evergarden is beautiful. While the stories she tells might not be as impactful as intended, her own very much makes up for it. Once you come visit me, I shall relay it to you whole.



Yours, Roland.

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"Dear Violet Evergarden:

With news of your arrival, you managed to rally up our community in a way no upcoming first installment title has before. The way you presented yourself was inviting, enchanting even. Few knew exactly what they were in for, but while not many expected a work as flawed as yourself, they knew to expect something beautiful. Your approach to conveying emotion is interesting, to say the least. Your intentions were rather wonderful: to show someone adjust to life after a war in which her entire existence was predicated towards, while trying to understand and convey emotions via letters and experiences in order to
                  ...
understand the last words of someone she loved. You take this robotic husk of a human being, slowly piece her past and how others are affected by said past, and have her grow as a person thanks to the people she encounters and the experiences she has. You showcase the brutality of war and the despair it has on civilians who will never see their loved ones again, all the while showcasing the struggles of adapting to civilization and coping with loss. On paper, it seemed to be a precious concept. While you seem to understand how to convey emotion, how to tie emotional moments together for maximum payoff, and how to truly utilize the audiovisual medium of animation to accentuate every emotional moment, you seem to have a difficult time earning emotional climaxes thanks to your pacing, how you like to spell out how a character, most commonly Violet herself, has grown, and the sheer lunacy you display in occasion. In a way, you’re eerily similar to your main character.

You don’t entirely lack subtlety per se, but you tend to spell out how Violet or another character has developed after an experience or what one of them is thinking that the audience is supposed to take away from a scene. It is the equivalent of Violet telling people how they are feeling. As they do not like it when she does it, it is bothersome when you do it. I like how you try to clue us into the fate of Violet's beloved major early on, simply with the characters’ pauses, their expressions, and how they try to dodge the issue. If you were more like that, simply letting the visuals convey a character’s feelings and what they mean in any given situation, you would’ve been even more emotionally resonant, especially early on and in the very end.

Another hindrance to the power of what you convey is how you skip events. For example, in episode 3, Violet enrolls in a program to improve her skills, and by the halfway point, she still cannot convey emotions in her writing, so she fails the course. After one more exercise after an unknown amount of time has passed, after the course is over, she writes a small, satisfactory letter, and automatically passes. Moments like this feel far too sudden, too undercooked, and thus, unearned. Each story is episodic in nature, in that they begin and end by the end of any given episode. With the way you employed this style of writing, you failed to give yourself enough room for some of these stories to play out properly. As such, you resort to nebulous and/or blatant time skips such as a few month time skip in episode 5, which makes everything feel ridiculous and cheap. The progression of Violet herself is not only spelled out to unfortunate degrees, but erratic and unnatural. Her character builds with each interaction, each letter, and each new event she finds herself as a centerpiece of, but the effects feel ill-prepared. It does not feel disingenuous or forced, but it feels awkward and confused at times. The silliness and even stupidity of some of your situations and outcomes make it even harder to take these tear-jerking moments seriously.

Violet is your primary focus, as she is molded by those around her. She is incredibly well-constructed, with every story hand-crafted to tie into her in some way, and make her grow as a person and understand emotions and love better than she did before each encounter, even if they sometimes feel like overdone conveniences for the sake of more tears. Additionally, her progression feels awkwardly handled, and as if she grew far too fast too quickly. The time skips make this even more apparent, such as in episodes 3 and 5. It is also a shame that the characters do not click as well as expected. You give us a few entertaining individuals such as Cattleya, but the rest feel less like distinct characters whose plights shake you to your knees, and more like people designed to get violet to grow and relate for the sake of pruning your doughy eyes. This would be fine if everything felt natural, but it doesn’t, so the cast, while not inherently bad or weak, are not nearly as impactful as Violet herself. Even the rare comedic moment feels forced, and moments of Violet being blunt are somehow far more amusing. Some of the more asinine moments you showcase are equally hilarious, unintentionally so. At the very least, these side-characters generally do a satisfactory job at what they are intended, so emotional scenes work with them, but there is a surprising lack of chemistry between them and violet, or between each other. Some almost feel like they should never be allowed to interact with certain characters lest they become harder to put up with. Other characters can be borderline laughable or outright pathetic, such as miscellaneous military men in episodes such as 8, or the male tsundere in episode 6. Violet cannot carry the weight of your cast on her own, especially when some do the dolls don't even get their closure unlike the one-offs.

However, as mentioned prior, you have a clear path you intend to tread, and you know exactly how to tie things together, even at the borderline frequent cost of the naturality and subtlety required for you to succeed at your goals. The purposeful irony behind your usage of “doll” is brilliant, as Violet is described as a doll in a variety of ways, from her job description to her as a person. Each story reveals something new about Violet that causes her to relate to them, such as how she got her name, or feeling the warmth of knowing a soldier you care about is alive. These are thinly-veiled, however. They are small, fleeting moments strung together in rapid succession to build without realizing the time there must be set aside or how natural and unspoken the growth must be. Combined with the borderline confusing and barely explored world-building, you’re ultimately a worse Mahoutsukai no Yome in this regard, and that's a shame given how you weave everything together to piece Violet more and more together each time, and how you utilized its audiovisual strengths to bolster your moments. These moments grow all the stronger, all the more painful in the second half, as things feel much more grounded, well-paced, and devastating on the whole, while the moments of nonsense stopped interfering for most part, ending entirely excluded.

Evan Call, oft known as someone who composes good music for bad shows, seems to have broken that reputation thanks to you, as he furnishes you, an actually competent show, with a myriad of emotional pieces that compliment their scenes in a satisfactory way. A few pieces stood out, such as “Never Coming Back” and “Inconsolable” for being the most emotional of them all, and “Torment” for being the only notable string piece full of violins and cellos. While none of his work here truly rivals his magnum opus “One More Time” for an inferior show named Chronos Ruler, this is probably the best soundtrack he has composed overall. Where the music he has gifted you truly shines, however, is with the opening: “Sincerely”, by TRUE. As one of the best opening of the year and one of the most emotional openings, even songs I have listened to, this song represents everything you hope to achieve, and moves me even more than your emotional climaxes do. Your ED theme, ""Michishirube (みちしるべ)"" by Minori Chihara, tries a similar approach, but the vocals can downplay the effects of the sad song.

Even with all the grievances I have laid down against you, I cannot deny your beauty. Kyoto Animation worked diligently to craft every scene with luscious detail, with gorgeous, intricate designs, subtle animation movements, and so much more. Even when the light saturation becomes intense at times, those moments have a distinct purpose. Even with the occasionally awkward CGI, it is barely present, so it barely detracts from your beauty. They may have gone overboard in terms of blurring backgrounds for the sake of depth of field, but it does not detract too heavily from what a sight you are to behold. The metallic hands, with all sorts of wonderful coloration, really feel as detailed as a fantastically animated anime film. Even with men that often look far too similar in face, the designs are as beautiful as the women you showcase. It is more than obvious that an immense amount of effort was put into the intricate craftsmanship of your appearance. The directing in some scenes, such as the graveyard scene of episode 8, or the first scene of the first episode, only strengthen the raw emotion being poured out in some of your best scenes. Even with the fight scenes that can only be described as competent, I can barely do justice to how gorgeous you are. Rest assured, as barring borderline insignificant moments and relatively understandable decisions and whatnot, you are one of the best-looking television productions I have ever laid eyes on.

In some ways, one might consider the hype surrounding you to have been incredibly excessive. In others, many seem to have been truly fulfilled by what you presented. Even with emotionally stunted and borderline laughable moments throughout the early half in particular, you succeeded at being impactful. Apologies are in order, as I cannot give you my happiest regards, regardless of your beauty and wonderful intentions. To the team that crafted you, I wish them luck in future endeavors, and on the prospect of making even better shows in the future. Enjoy the feelings you’ve invoked, and the fleeting moments you showcased to the world, for you’re under the service of many for now.

Sincerely, 

Cattleya's secret admirer"

The story is outstanding I mean the concept of meaning of love and what difference feelings make. Characters are amazing each and every one of them. Theme of the anime is 90's type which is less now a days. Animation is outstanding. sound track is amazingly soothing, and the music just makes the atmosphere so real. The last anime I watched

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"“Letters are among the most significant memorial a person can leave behind them.”  ―Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
“A letter always seemed to me like immortality because it is the mind alone without corporeal friend.” ― Emily Dickinson

You must be thinking, what the hell is wrong with this guy? Whats with all the ""letter"" quotes?

That's right!!! This anime actually gives you a perfect definition of letters, you must have heard of people in other reviews mentioning War, love story, Auto memoirs doll etc., Or at least got the feeling it would be one judging from 1st 2 episodes, but I would warn you guys
                  ...
this isn’t what you think it is, in fact, there isn’t a straight story at all.

This is rather a story or rather a slice of life(SOL) of a girl (named Violet Evergarden) who is a weapon in war, trying to adjust in society post-war by writing the letters for people and understanding the feelings of the sender and receiver.
So why does she want to write the letters? That’s because she wants to know the meaning of “I love you”……….You must be thinking….wtf???? Yeah, that’s true, this must have been the dumbest reason for anyone to learn writing letters (even the lieutenant Hodgins says that in the series), but you will understand that in the long run it kinda makes sense :P

So then there is no story and lots of negative reasons stated above (most importantly who would want to know about “letters”?), then…… why is there a damn 8 in the rating????

Well, even though there are lots of negative factors, at the end of the day it is able to deliver what we need in an anime, i.e the enjoyment, the emotional connection with the scene and mainly the importance of letters, i.e from a ‘small sentence’ to uniting couples with ‘long letters’, the letter has the power to move people's heart, that's the power of letters, which is really depicted well here.

Alright cutting everything short, It is a collection of short stories with Violet in each episode is interacting with different people and changing their lives and also herself knowing what it is to be a human, what it feels like to lose a human and even you might get motivated from Violet as she tries hard learning to understand what human feelings are.

The main beauty of this anime is the ART, the animation, and camera view. All characters are so beautiful that everyone looks like a doll. You wouldn't even know for half of the series whether Violet is actually a doll or a human.
The setting is historic, most probably during world war I  (The robotic arms of Violet seem too much advanced for that time or even present). The background, the colors, the time lapse, the sky, the flowers, the stars and even wine, every detail is so beautiful and so colorful that it gives you realistic appeal and makes you feel as if you were at that place.

The SOUNDTRACKS are another awesome tool for making this anime nostalgic. The classic orchestral music and emotional soundtracks are really awesome which resonate perfectly and sync with the situation bringing out the emotions out of you.
The opening song is also used differently and is introduced in 3rd episode (seems this style is called progressive)  is a great song and matches perfectly with the situation. While the ending is also good which is introduced in the 2nd episode.

OVERALL:
Well coming to the final opinion, which matters the most!!! This show definitely has lot of flaws from dodging bullets like Flash(Superhero), executing a person with sword while having a gun at hand, to writing public love letters and many dramatic scenes which I wouldn’t want to spoil you, which are made to make you emotional but when you think later logically, it might seem kinda dumb but still at the time of watching it makes you forget the flaws and makes you immerse in those lies, that's the beauty of this anime, making you connect with characters without much development just like Mushishi or kino no tabi. Therefore stating all various reasons,even though the anime Violet Evergarden is not suited for the likes of many, but still, it is definitely worth watching, at least once :P

For some, it would be ""that most hyped series"" or for others it might be ""that hyped series which lived to its reputation"", well, either way, it is going to be remembered lol.

And my advice for you is, at least watch 5 episodes before you drop ( If you feel like dropping) and Don’t binge watch it, because either your heart will melt or it might harden into a stone basing on your response.

I have put out all the negative things about anime for you so that you might not be surprised and drop it out in middle. Did it give negative thoughts to fans?? I don't think so, because they will like it even if there are many flaws besides this.

well, that's the end of the review, you could stop here or read below for FAQs and more detailed Analyses of the series and character development, of course, it is spoiler-free. :D

_______________________________________________________________________________

Dub or sub? : Personally, I feel that sub is a lot better because, at the actual point of creating an emotional moment, in the dub, the words are uttered as if they were read from Google translate. While the sub has better words which suit the dialogue. But in rest of the situations, the dub is also good.

Analysis of Story:
One thing is good in this anime, It keeps you guessing what this anime might be turn out to be ? just when you are thinking of being fed-up or you made up your mind what this anime is gonna be? , that's when the story changes because, at present, you might observe that the genre of this anime is listed as SOL but it wasn’t the case when this series was airing, everyone used to talk how the series might turn out to be(Forums). In detail, first 2 episodes are like a slight introduction to the current state Violet is, with focus given more to the surrounding places, the anime setting, the camera views etc, for example, The starting scene is just like the scene from Assassin's creed where the eagle flies and the camera shifts with respect to it while here a paper or perhaps the letter flies in its place.

Then slowly from episode 3, the slice of life starts and by the end of episode 7 just when you are thinking this series is full of it, writing letters blah blah, the flashback or Violet’s past kicks into play, and you get to see it for about for 2 episodes making you think, well we might get to watch a war anime perhaps, but it stops there and again the SOL begins, So by the time you reach episode 11 it makes sense that this anime is all about letters and its significance but its not really about violet's past, well that’s where you are wrong again, just watch the series and know what it is :)

Difference between Light novel and anime?
Personally, I didn’t read the novel but from the opinion of others, few other characters were introduced, Violet is more humane and less aggressive here and most of the unrealistic parts were removed like Violet with a battle axe. But the only fault is the 12th episode which gave a negative response from Novel fans by mentioning novel version was better and had more realistic feeling for that part. 

Difference of experience between new and old watchers of this series:
For anyone new to Violet Evergarden, as I mentioned earlier you can observe that the genre is SOL, drama. you can have that premeditated feeling of watching a SOL. There is both negative and positive effect of it, the positive part is that you know that you are going to watch a SOL so you are mentally prepared not expecting much of a story but the negative part is that you wouldn’t have that suspense what this series may turn out to be? 

Coming to Characters:
We all know that Slice of life means character development or vice versa but this isn’t the case here, as violet meets new people in every episode, so there isn’t much possibility for character development. That being said, I'll talk about few prominent characters which need to be noticed:

Violet: People might either hate her due to her PTSD traits, inexpressive nature, and a bad example of Saber ( Fate series) 'OR' love her as innocent, fragile and she strives to be a better person and also fans of Saber might like her. This show is basically about Violet so you need to watch the show and understand about her, leaving here coming to another major character, 

Major Gilbert: There are huge amount of novel fans who might love him, but his character is just developed for about 2 episodes in anime and you can observe his and Violet’s relationship to be similar to like that of father and daughter, He is the main cause of Violet’s change of behaviour or character due to the fatherly love is shown by him. Many people(novel readers) say that he loved her like a partner but I didn’t feel the same. His role is very less, then there is his friend:

Lieutenant-Colonel Hodgins: I felt him to another good guy, he is more developed then Gilbert lol, he also plays a major role in supporting Violet, by getting her a job, taking care of her and even give the right amount of comfort to her as per Gilbert’s request but he doesn’t feel burdened.

The only controversial person who seemed out of character every-time in new episode is Gilbert’s brother Dietfried. In one episode he seems harsh on Violet (Ep 5), in other episode he thinks her to have changed (Ep 8) and again in 12th episode it is shown that he still doesn’t believe in Violet still but takes her advice or saves her and many more weird multiple unstable traits are exhibited by him,
other than that rest all characters are developed for an episode or two and left, For example, characters like Benedict ( postman), Luculia, Iris, Erica (Dolls)etc are used just for the sake of story’s progress in latter small and significant parts which might make many people angry for not developing them or using them properly, since we are mainly focused on Violet’s point of view I think its better to ignore the rest.

I hope you like this kind of writing style in which I seem like interacting with you and I hope this review motivated you to watch it ✌

I hope I didn't bore you with all the praises, I did want to criticize and write a review like a critic, but every time I re-watched the series, I kept falling in love with it and most probably you are gonna too :)"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Okay, I've seen so much criticism befall this anime so I'm going to try and be as thorough as possible with this review. I won't include spoilers, however, and will try not to mention any major events which happen through the anime so bear with me if I sound a little vague.

Story
Pardon me, but this anime is a bitch. It basically aims in any way possible to trigger those tears of yours. It's probably one of the few anime which made me cry this much that I can only think of another one. Just prepare your tissues and be ready because there is a high
                  ...
probability that the onion ninjas will be paying you a visit.

Now to the criticism I've mentioned earlier. There has been so much hate going around over this anime and from what I've seen I think most of it for the story being ""too linear"" . Yes, it's not like the usual anime you'd see most of the time, but it's all a matter of perspective really. I'll advice you beforehand; try and view it as a play and not an anime and you'll find yourself being immersed into it.

One thing to note though is that the beginning of the story is nothing like what's yet to come. The first three episodes, especially, are a prelude to the anime itself and emphasize on Violet's character and describing the setting in an orderly manner. Perhaps too orderly that you'd feel quite bored at times. Because of that, I thought that all this anime was is just some quality art and breathtaking scenery, but trust me that this is far too presumptuous so at least give it five episodes before you decide to continue with it or not.

The setting of the story looks like England in the 80s, but the names of the countries, cities and even the language are all fictional to my knowledge. Since there is plenty of focus on the state of war the countries have gone through and what those wars have caused, the creators might have chosen not to mention anything that would bring up hard feelings into the story which is a wise decision if you ask me.

Okay, so now that pretty much sums up the subtle details of the story and its general idea. Now for the story itself, Violet Evergarden is a girl of about 14 *cough*underage*cough*. Back in her childhood with no parents, name or feelings she was viewed by almost everyone around her as a killing tool or a loli weapon of mass destruction who knew nothing except how to kill. She didn't even know how to speak, but all of this changed once Gilbert took her in as a gift from his brother. From that point on she was intended to be Gilbert's weapon to be utilized in army as a weapon as usual. However, Gilbert disagrees greatly with this and chooses to treat her as a proper human being. He raised her, taught her, took care of her and eventually loved her. (゜ロ゜)
What happens is that Violet is currently trying to understand emotions; love to be specific. As the major in his last breaths' confesses his love to her, but Violet couldn't understand what his words meant. Thus, begins Violet's beautiful journey to pursue pure emotions and convey them to people as she starts to understand them herself as well.
Let me tell you this, she's going to be exploring emotions alright and you'll be exploring emotions just as much so don't forget those tissues of yours. You have been warned!

Art
HoHoHo do I even need mention a thing here? The reason of all the hype before this anime came out is because of its art style. An artist's wet dream would be an understatement to its beauty. Just watch the trailer to get a solid idea of what I mean.

The scenery are extra bright and the characters are very well-polished from tip to toe. Just look at their beautiful eyes when they're not full of tears! The usage of the art style varies by episode. There are some where you'll be awestruck by the beauty and others where you won't be as much. The characters' style isn't the main beauty of this anime, but they surely look beautiful and original and I think the latter is what matters the most.
The scenery, however, will have you drooling waterfalls, which is another good reason for the tissues by the way, so unless you don't like those bright colors and overly detailed scenery, you won't be disappointed.

Character Development
I think most of what I'd say here would be redundant. Violet is probably the only character who has significant amount of development while the others don't even have that much screen time to begin with. The anime is split into two arcs, the main one where Violet faces her traumatizing history and all that she's been through and the secondary arc which is episodic to the characters Violet encounters through her journey. The secondary arc is a thousandfold more emotional than the main one and has plenty more of character development included, but that's to characters who'll only last for one episode so I'm not sure you can really call that ""development"". Nonetheless, their characters undergo drastic self-speculation which overflow with emotions so, if you ask me, I find it impressive how much they managed to fit into a single episode.

Sound
This is such a vital part of this anime and I don't think it I could have appreciated the beauty of it without this beautiful soundtrack. Think of it as the adhesive which connects everything into the big picture. It's almost entirely on the classical side, which I'm fond of, so you might not like it if you hate classical music, but honestly, who does?
The characters' voices are pretty good as well. I liked some more than others, but everyone fit his character and played it well. You can clearly tell the VAs were immersed in their roles and paid very close attention to the details. My favorite one was introduced in the last episode though, so I can't really say who she is without spoiling too much. If you do choose to view this anime as a play and let yourself immerse into it you'll certainly know who she is, though.

Entertainment
Despite the shed tears, spilled blood and fatal wounds, I can with all honesty tell you that this anime was indeed enjoyable. You'll probably need some light series to recover after you're done with it, but you won't regret a single moment and are sure to appreciate its beauty. It's certainly a piece of art you'll enjoy watching and an experience you'll cherish.

Watch this if: You have high tolerance to onions, You're looking for breathtaking animation, You like Slice of Life, You want an anime presented in a new perspective.
Don't watch this if: You're not into drama(VERY DRAMATIC), You don't like slow-paced story lines, You're looking for action(Really mild here), You don't have tissues."

Mary Balogh
Before the Winter 18 season had even began Violet Evergarden was set out to be one of the most anticipated animes of the year. It has been heavily advertised on social media anime websites as well as being first anime to be released weekly on UK Netflix. When I first saw the trailer for this show I was really excited because I thought this show would continue the Kyoani streak where they constantly gave us greats shows like Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Sound! Euphonium 2 and A Silent Voice. Maybe I was expecting too much as
                  ...
this point because I forgot that Kyoani is the origin of the style over substance shows where despite having great production values and music the story and characters simply don’t hold well especially when you try to re-watch them. There are a few expectations such as Full Metal Panic, K-on, and the shows I just mentioned in the Kyoani streak but the end of the day I don’t value Kyoani all that much compared to other studios like Bones, Sunrise, Madhouse and even J.C Staff.
So how does this relate to Violet Evergarden you may ask? Simply put Violet Evergarden repents almost everything that is wrong with Knoani shows as a whole. It took everything that was wrong from past Knoani and makes them worse. Combined with the great production values and music that covers up the lackluster story and characters than you got a show that feels like a tech demo instead of a complete product. Seriously what the hell happened Knoani? You took 3 steps forward with Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Sound! Euphonium 2 and A Silent Voice and now you’re taking 5 steps back.
Just wow!!!
Now with all that said hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review Violet Evergarden and with all said let’s begin.

Story.
The story follows a former young military girl named who after serving in the war is now crippled both physically and mentally where not only she lost both of her arms she also has temporary amnesia where she cannot remember anything. One day a person named Colonel Hodgins an old acquaintance of Gilbert arrives to pick up violet from the hospital so she can be adopted by the Evergarden family which Gilbert had already arranged. However since Violet cannot adjust to civilian life due to her military indoctrination and amnesia Hodgins hires Violet to being a postal worker. Shortly after she witnesses the Auto Memory Dolls which is a group of writers who carry people thoughts and converts them into words. While witnessing Auto Memory Dolls she remembers the words ""I love you"" that was told by Gilbert towards Violet. Wanting to meaning the words she decides to become a Auto Memories Dolls and from there here journey begins as she comes face to face with various people’s emotions and differing shapes of love as well searching the meaning of the words ""I love you"" told by Gilbert.
The story has quite a bit of decent things in it but at the same time a lot of bad.
One of the things that I liked about Evergarden is its episodic nature in the beginning as Violet does her job as an automated writer who writes for others. I liked the concept of it. However, as the series progressed it, unfortunately, got repetitive and predictable and it got to a point where am watching the same thing over and over again in terms of how almost every episode ends. 
If there’s one thing that I liked about Violet Evergarden that is not the great production values and music are the themes. No matter how predictable and shallow the show was Violet Evergarden least did a decent job exploring the themes of understanding one another, emotional and love. When this show is not predictable as actually having good writing it actually showcases how these themes can affect the characters especially with violet where at the beginning of the series where actually a living robot with no personality thanks to amnesia however as the series goes she's slowly starting to understand people emotions as well understanding true love. Am much I enjoyed how Violet Evergarden presented it themes I feel at times it got kinda preachy where certain characters just annoyingly preach how they don’t understand people feelings and love etc. It just got really annoying and at times the show really tries to shove down its messages right down our throats.    
Now that’s all the decent about the story let’s get to the bad things about the story.
For starters, most of the episodes are hit or miss. Some episodes were good and it was decently written while others episodes ranged from mediocre, boring to downright awful
Another big flaw of Violet Evergarden is the terrible pacing. Good lord this show pacing is very slow but not in a good way. I know it’s a slice of life show/ drama and all but did they really have to make it into a snooze feast especially in the first half. 
No wonder why me and my group of friends called this series Violet Everboring or worst No Man’s Evergarden (No Man’s Sky) because not only the pacing was terrible where it people to sleep but it was ultimately uninteresting thanks to its shallow writing emotional moments and characters. 
I also didn’t like the fact that it was trying to hardest to be a tearjerker. Excluding episodes 10 and 11 all of the emotional moments were pretty lackluster and had no real impact thanks to its dull characters and shallow/predictable writing.  It doesn’t help the fact that this show directing is up there with the god-awful Transformers movies that were done by Michael Bay
By far this shows biggest sin is that it's a another style over substance show where despite the having great production values and music the show’s writing and characters are terrible and I hate shows when they do this. Okay, I will admit that this show at times has some substance where it does a pretty decent job with its themes’ and developing a very small handful of its characters which other shows of its type don’t even do it at all looking at you DARLING in the FRANXX. However, these good things come far between as this show throughout most of its run likes focus on showings of its production values and music while having subpar characters and writing.
4/10
Characters.
If the story a couple of decent things in it than I almost nothing positive about the characters in Evergarden. 
Violet herself is a pretty alright character sure she starts off being very bland but as the show progresses she very slowly becomes quite a decent character that gets’s good character development. However, I will admit she’s a pretty hard character to relate due to her wooden personality especially in the first half of the series where she’s literally unlikable. The rest of the characters are one note and they are just as interesting as watching grass grow thanks to the other characters being bland, boring, annoying to downright awful. 
Overall despite Violet being a decently developed character I just cannot relate to her at all plus almost of the supporting characters are all generic drama that we all seen being before in better drama animes. I really wanted to like this characters cast but I couldn’t due to the characters being utterly unlikeable and development with the expectation of violet who is decent characters at best despite her being unrelatable as hell.
3/10
Visuals and sound.
If there is one thing that was great about Violet Evergarden it would be the visuals and soundtrack.
This is quite simply one of the best looking animes I have ever seen in my life. The amount of detail that was showed in this show is insane. Characters designs were great, the background scenery was wonderful to look at and the color direction was great. Like with The Ancient Magus Bride this show has wonderful camerawork and lighting but its way better as this show has great shot composition.  As for actual animation, it’s pretty amazing. Every scene is very well animated, all the scenes flow well to each other and it the movement was fluid. I have no complaints with the visuals whatsoever.
As for the soundtrack like the with the visuals, it’s amazing. Every single track in the show was a joy to listen and it fits tones with the show for the most part.
The opening theme ""Sincerely"" by TRUE is a pretty great opening theme that I liked.
The ending theme Michishirube by Minori Chihara was pretty good but not as great as the opening theme, however, the ending that plays in episode 9 Believe in by Aira Yuuki was fantastic. 

Now for sub vs dub.
The sub is great as you expect as every Seiyuu did a great job with the roles that were given so I have no complaints with the sub. The dub, on the other hand, was actually surprising pretty good with a lot of good talented voice actors.
10/10 for both Visuals and Sound.

Final Thoughts.
Violet Evergarden is just an another Oscar bait type of anime. It got a lot of attention from anime fans thanks to great advertisement and trailers. It also tried to convince the audience that this show is going to next big thing but it ultimately fells flat in almost every way possible if you don’t count the visuals and music. The story was lackluster at best that is filled with subpar/predictable writing, shitty pacing, weak emotional impacts that at times was written by a 12-year-old. All of the characters besides Violet were pathetically bad thanks to them being clichéd as hell as well being very unlikeable. The only actually good things about this show are the visuals, music dub and some of the well-explored themes in this.
Everything else is pretty much a dumpster fire by comparison and it really made sad because I really wanted to like this show but this show just failed to deliver thanks to its on-going problems that never seem to go away and at the end of the Violet Evergarden is a beautiful train-wreck that barely has any substance whatsoever. 
Easily the most disappointing anime I have seen from 2018 by far and I know it’s pretty early to say that but once 2018 comes to a close this anime would be number 1 for most disappointing animes list.
Don’t buy into the hype from people about this series because it’s not worth it at all as it will heavily disappoint you.
Final Score 4/10"

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Filters, dolls, and grooming children Woody Allen style, the somewhat contentious Violet Evergarden attempts to do so much. From the precise, focused presentation by Kyoto Animation's art team to the messy, bloated, and ugly narrative, there is a lot to consume within the series. A lot to consume, but not a lot to digest. Like an airy, mediocre castella cake, it slips into your mouth with an initial hint of sweetness but once you really begin chewing it is just a piece of soft, bland bread. 

With KyoAni's dark horse in the director's chair struggling desperately to milk every ounce of emotion from this series,
                  ...
we get a holistically fake experience. One, like the dolls presented, lacking all forms of nuance, subtlety, and pacing. It is too slow when getting through exposition, too fast when the trajectory is on the action, and ultimately a confusing, directionless mess of scattering debris and disappointing characterization with equally banal storytelling. 

It looks pretty incredible though.

[Beauty Hides the Beast]

Yeah, so Evergarden is unarguably a looker. It delivers in virtually every aspect of animation.  Kyoto Animation has, in my opinion, the most talented and proficient group of animators in the entire anime industry and then some. With a relatively small team, they release products that put every other televised anime to utter and hilarious shame. They even put some films to shame with this series. It really is that good looking.

Evergarden's aesthetic exists in the minutia, too. Not just how time-saving techniques pioneered decades ago are virtually not present within this series, which might be one of the most captivating things about the show, but it is in the lighting. How meticulous the effects work is. How they managed to convey manga-level detail into fully animated characters is literally unlike anything else I've seen in the television anime hemisphere. 

The soundtrack is solid, even if it is overbearing. We get backing tracks over almost every scene. Thankfully, a few of them are earworms and others are simply serviceable. The opening and closing tracks are pretty forgettable and I honestly ended up skipping past them when I could. 

Everything isn't perfect in the land of lens flares and filters, unfortunately. The direction is weak. I say weak in comparison to just about any other KyoAni product I've seen. Ishidate either struggled with restrictions or simply couldn't develop a coherent and unique style for himself, which is rare for the beautiful palate of directors KyoAni has the privilege of working with. The few episodes helmed by other names were substantially easier on the eyes.

That's not to say the direction is awful in the grand scheme of things. It is serviceable and this series is generally directed like a mediocre drama anime. We get all the famous, cliche, and boring shots that you'd expect from any other drama of Evergarden's ilk. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The beauty here really masks the beast underneath, though. While the art is unquestionably jaw-dropping and audacious. There is a lot under the hood of this series that is decidedly not so. This leads me to the beast. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[The Beast]

Violet Evergarden is a super-soldier from an unknown location that is never explained or mentioned in any detail. The world here is a steampunky post-victorian England. She was trained to be nothing but a weapon. Violet is treated poorly by all the generic military men you can imagine until she is gifted, as a tool, to a random generic military guy that isn't a douchebag for some reason. This guy is Gilbert, a handsome blue-haired anime boy that is probably around twice Violet's age. He buys her a knick-knack and because this twelve-year-old girl has been treated like the gum on the bottom of a shoe by everyone but this one Gilbert fellow she instantly grows attached to him.

He proceeds to follow orders rigidly, throwing this twelve-year-old girl into battles where she promptly slaughters everyone. How does this twelve-year-old girl do this? Never explained. Regardless, she's overpowered as hell and probably has ninja-genes because she naruto-runs all over these redshirts. One thing leads to another and in a war-ending battle Gilbert is injured and she tries to save him. In the process, she loses both arms and he kind of maybe sort of dies. 

Now, post-war, she begins work as an ""auto-memory doll"", which is pretty much a ghostwriter for letters. She vows to find the ""meaning of love"", which is as corny as it sounds. Violet meets a few colorful characters, and by colorful I mean lacking personality but are literally colorful. After that, we are treated to a few vignettes that are presented throughout the series. 

Here's how they go : 

--> Problem/Task is introduced.

--> Violet needs to travel and write.

--> Violet takes off her gloves and everyone goes ""OwO what's this?"" 

--> She writes something about this problem, which is somewhat related to her experiences in the past through virtue of thematic resemblances. 

--> Problem resolves in a way which is either bittersweet or mostly bitter.

--> Someone monologues about something vaguely related to the story. 

Ironically, these vignettes, barring episode five, are the best narratives of the series. There are two specific highlights. One is a sweet, albeit corny story of a struggling drunk playwright and how Violet reminds him of a lost loved one. The other is a short about an ill mother. Both of these hold a decent, saccharine emotional punch that genuinely is good enough for this series. Unfortunately, Evergarden quickly relapses back into the ""main narrative"" which actually unbearable. 

Before I touch on that, I want to mention that episode five is honestly disturbing. In this vignette, Violet attempts to assist a bratty crybaby princess in writing letters to a prince she's ""in love"" with. This marriage they must engage with is political, clearly, but of course, she is head-over-heels for this guy. She's fourteen. He's twenty-four. The parallels here are beyond clear and they are quite creepy. More so because unlike a lot of anime which does include this kind of cringe-inducing nonsense and more, this series plays itself disarmingly straight with this. You are supposed to believe and connect with the idea of a fourteen-year-old girl being married to a twenty-four-year-old man. But to make matters worse, this princess recalls the first time she met him (and the only time), which prompted her to fall in love with him.

She was ten. He was twenty. We get treated with an absolutely delicious bone-chilling flashback to when she was alone, crying, and this twenty-year-old man comforts this girl. It wouldn't be creepy if they weren't getting married four years later. The excuse I see here is that this was ""Victorian England so it's fine! It's acceptable to promote child abuse!"" Yeah...no? That isn't the case.

We aren't making movies about slavery and painting that in a positive light just because ""oh it's a period piece!"" No. It was morally wrong then, it is morally wrong now. I don't enjoy how this series is promoting these issues as if it is some grand romantic statement. Violet goes so far as to say ""Love knows no age."" Violet. Stop this. Stop it. If the argument here is, ""she's a dumb robot-Esq girl."" Yeah, she is. But the whole point of writing something this abhorrent is to eventually correct her, not play every following scene as straight and supposedly romantic. Bad choices here. Bad. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[The Beast... on Further Review]

This leads us to the main narrative. We never get Violet's origins. The show bothers to explain them in maybe one or two vague lines that don't actually explain why a twelve-year-old on the battlefield is somehow socially acceptable to this decently structured and seemingly morally just society. I mean, I get a general being a cartoonishly inhuman asshole. What I don't get is soldiers not questioning this in any situation. It is downright silly and, due to this, no verisimilitude is created.

It is as if every piece of detail was forcibly thrust into the animation and presentation, but not the actual writing. Even the minutia begins to slowly fall apart under any critical lens. There is this strange facial-gag that Violet does a few times where she squeezes and pulls at her cheeks and forces this wonky looking smile. It is admittedly cute. It, unfortunately, makes no sense.

She smiles. She smiles a lot in this series at crucial points. She isn't incapable of smiling. Why does she do this? This strange gag was included multiple times and there is no reason for it. It doesn't make sense and this already messy character becomes even messier. A gag isn't worth that pain. Pulling back, though, we get this limp story about almost nothing. Finding the ""meaning of love"" seems to be vague enough if it were given nuance to sprout. Unfortunately, it has been a dry season for nuance for Kyoto Animation's writers it seems. There is not a shred of it to be found. I get that character nuance is kind of a rarity within this medium, but this series gets really abrasive about not having it.

I'm talking flashbacks to remind you of shit you should not be forgetting. Constantly. Constant barrages of flashbacks that utterly decimate the pacing. Everything is completely over-explained, especially the emotions. There are scenes where poor ol' Violet is bawling her eyes out but has the decency of explaining exactly what emotions she's feeling to us. No one else, just us, the viewer, gets a front-row seat for clunky expository dialogue anyone with half a brain can deduce. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[Much Ado About Comparisons]

This season we had two series about girls who have to deal with the loss of a loved one. One being Violet Evergarden and the other being A Place Further Than the Universe. If you asked me, based solely on description and preview, which one of those would thoroughly trounce the other in almost every way? I'd have to go with Evergarden. 

I couldn't have been more wrong. 

When this series decides it is a quasi-romance it is a very bad quasi-romance. I've seen some arguments regarding how Violet is supposed to be a ""daughter figure"" to this Gilbert guy, but unfortunately, when the first thing you parallel this relationship to is an underage and really creepy romance, I can't really drop the fact that it feels like a creepy romance. Even if it is thankfully never established explicitly as such. However, there are, as much as it pains me to write, even more flaws here. Firstly, I can't be brought to give a single shred of a fuck about Violet or this Gilbert Grape fellow. His personality is... ""Nice Guy"". While that might resonate with someone who also considers themselves to be a ""Nice Guy"" who wants nothing more than a semi-sentient doll-like girl to issue commands towards. For anyone else, I'm struggling to imagine a scenario where you'd connect with these two characters.

They have no chemistry. 

Violet and Gilbert are at odds as a couple or even as a father/daughter archetype. A father would do all he can not to send his percieved daughter into the midst of multiple battles whilst yelling such lines as ""Follow as she leads!"" Yes. Let us follow this emotionally stunted twelve-year-old during our siege on a castle. Great idea. If the argument here is that he was ""under orders"", then he isn't much of a caring father, is he? That he'd be willing to potentially lose this daughter figure if it meant getting a discharge from the military. Nothing about this felt realistic. I didn't buy these two characters being together and Violet's attachment to him was akin to a lost puppy rather than a loved one.

The second option here is that she is a marketing choice. Otaku seem to love this kind of character archetype, much to my surprise, and perhaps that is why she was created like this. I, personally, can't imagine someone who would want to marry or get to know this kind of person. Can you imagine how boring she must be on a date? What would you even talk about when she can hardly even speak? Regardless of my pondering on the logistics of waifuism in anime, the ultimate truth here is that her development, whilst unarguably there, is messy as hell. Most of her revelations are kept offscreen and reserved to the multiple time-skips in the narrative from episode-to-episode. She jumps from incompetent writer incapable of even understanding the basic nuance of human emotion to easily writing letters between royalty. It is preposterously paced. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[Conclusion]

Evergarden really struggles. Both as a character and a series. There are moments of real highs, especially in two one-off stories that have a nice emotional punch to them. However, every single aspect of the narrative is either wholly underwhelming or utterly ludicrous. There isn't a shred of verisimilitude to be developed and this series often reaches too far for cloying emotional drama. 

If you find yourself connecting with a lot of dramatic anime that usually have bombastic orchestral or J-pop insert-songs suffocating every ounce of dialogue that usually just amounts to girls crying a lot, then you might enjoy this if you look past some of the horrendous pacing. Otherwise, I'd, unfortunately, advise you give this show a skip.If you find yourself interested in the aesthetic, maybe sitting through the first episode is worth it. If you value aesthetic as much as I do it might be worth the entire series in and of itself. It truly is unlike anything else. It is like a tech-demo of the Kyoto Animation Engine at Ultra-settings running on a super-computer. This is how television anime can look. Mindblowing. Even with sub-optimal directing. 

There are themes here. The seasons play a role and plenty of the characters have names that represent different kinds of flowers. It's sweet, really. I think in concept, with a sturdy hand and a sturdier pen it could've worked. These themes don't serve a purpose, though. They shouldn't even be brought up because apart from being frosting on a cake you can point your finger and ogle at, they are ultimately nothing. Scratch the dressing metaphor, they're like those plastic toys atop an expensive cake you'd think were edible but are proven to be nothing but hazards to your three-year-old. 

I think the aesthetic does wonders to carry just how upsetting and mundane the rest of the series is. So much so that I'd average it to being a wholly mediocre experience and not an outright bad one. Even if there is a depressingly large amount of crap to sift through, it looks great. It's like a Lamborghini transporting piles of horse manure. Keep your eyes trained on that astoundingly gorgeous ride and maybe you won't smell the shit."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Oh, Violet Evergarden. Like a royal princess, your arrival was highly anticipated by the community. And just like a royal princess, many speculated over how beautiful and amazing you would be before you even saw the light of day, and others just waited to see you to be born and fail. And then when you were born and grow up, many still claimed you to be the most beautiful and fascinating princess ever born, some were disappointed that you didn´t manage to live up to their expectations, and some disliked you instantly because you were you. Where ever which category you belong to, one can
                  ...
say for certain that Violet Evergarden took her place in the spotlight this past season. Usually I’m not a royalist, but in my eyes Violet Evergarden (VE) were a fine princess, and definitely lived up to my expectations and more, both visually and substantively. So, let´s talk about the winter 2018´s most anticipated show, and why I thought it so good as I did.

Slow paced dramas are not usually what I go for, they often bore me to death before going anywhere, but I got a positive feeling as soon as I read the synopsis and saw the PV for VE. And I was not disappointed, quite the opposite. 

VE takes place in a post-war, 1920´s Europe like continent, where the north and south just reached a fragile peace. It´s a time of healing and rebuilding, which leaves the young teenager Violet Evergarden at a loss. Probably orphaned or abounded at a very young age, Violet were brought up as a child soldier. On the battle field under Major Gilbert Bougainvillea´s command, Violet became infamous for her brutal and cold efficiency by taking countless lives without batting an eyelash. Now with the war ended, and no more orders to for fill, Violet´s hardest test begins. The very last battle left Violet without arms, which was replaced with some crafty automail. That´s not really the issue though, but rather the acclimatization to be a normal person, with a normal life. All her life Violet had just known violence and orders, so to say that she´s socially awkward doesn’t even begin to cover it. The main theme of the show is Violet´s journey to understand her own and other´s emotions, especially what “I love you” means. She learns from others by working as an Auto-Memory Doll, which composes letters for others in their stead. It´s not like Violet doesn´t have feelings and emotions, she´s just very disconnected from them, and doesn´t know what they mean when she does feel them. I thought her journey was beautiful to watch, as she slowly experiences what it means to have different feelings, and how to express them. I think they tie up Violet´s past and future very smoothly throughout the show. The main part of the show is of an episodic nature, each in which Violet takes on requests at writing a letter for someone, and both Violet and that someone have an emotional exchange, often of the teary type. And just when you think that its all you are going to get, the show does something different towards the end, which in my eyes popped up the score one more notch. 

Is Violet Evergarden the most fascinating character ever made? Probably not, but I liked her a lot. Her blank persona, her robotic way of speaking is nothing ground breaking, but I liked how they slowly developed her without taking away that personality. Violet do look like the most beautiful doll, which together with that personality can be over the top and annoy people. I personally think it worked with the setting and all over story development, since the profession as dolls take a centre part. Violet´s inability to understand people´s emotions in the beginning forces her clients and colleagues to really explain their feelings and why they feel them, which forces them to grow as much as Violet at each encounter. I think that worked as a great red thread for the story, and made it more than just one-sided, which could easily happen when a story focuses so much on just one character. As for the other characters, they vary in importance and appeal, but overall, they fill out the story good. Some are more entertaining or interesting than others, such as Hodgins and the Bougainvillea brothers. They heavily influence Violet, as well as being interesting on their own. I can fully understand the ones who complain about the side characters, because VE is a one woman show, which is noticeable. So, if you´re not into Violet´s character, VE is probably not going to be an enjoyable experience for you.

No one in their right mind can say that VE looks nothing but stunning. And if some do say so, they just say that out of spite. Wherever you liked the story and characters or not, the visuals are colourful, detailed and beautiful from the beginning to the end. Kyoto Animation and Netflix has hold nothing back and shows how anime can look 2018. Everything from a bird´s view of a green hilled landscape, bathing in the orange light from the afternoon sun, to a view of a still autumn lake, sparkling with the sun´s rays and brown and yellow leaves, looked absolutely breath-taking. If you want to, you can positively drown in the characters eyes, as well made and pronounced as they are. In the rare occasions action do occur, its well-choregraphed, animated and left me with wishing for more. Could probably write a book about how good everything looks but let’s just stop here. So, to summon up the art and animations part up - Top score, overly pleased, I want to bath in those colours.

The soundtrack is well composed and harmonic, with beautiful instruments which creates a calm and emotional atmosphere. Which in my opinion runs very well with the storyline and Violet´s journey. The VA´s (Japanese) do an amazing job of portraying their characters, big as small roles. Yui Ishikawa voices Violet and does a brilliant job of conveying Violet´s damaged character. Sound effects is spot on, from the klicks of tangents, the gust of wind, to the sound of an air plane closing in in the sky. Once again, bravo.

I definitely understand that VE isn´t for everyone, but it is certainly for most. Like all princesses, VE can´t be loved by everyone, but boy does she shine like star. I enjoyed this show far more than I expected, teared up multiple times, and were fully invested in Violet´s emotional journey. I liked that they didn´t just displayed the positive side of feeling emotions, but what pain that can cause also. The shift in direction towards the end was a brilliant move and leaving me with the want for more. So, thank you Violet Evergarden, for showing me both such inner and outer beauty."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER

Violet Evergarden, another anime of the popular studio KyoAni. Let's start. 

The anime occurs after a war. Our MC is called Violet, a blond girl with prosthetic arms. She is working as a Doll (a woman that writes letters) because she needs to know the meaning of 'I love you'. Then, she will know many people in her journey. A nice story awaits us. What could go wrong? Everything! 

The story. Most of the anime is episodic (3-8 and 10-11). The ploblem is that the writing is very bad and repetitive. No matter how good the production quality or the soundrack is,
                  ...
the writing is more important. If the writing IS bad, the anime IS bad. Every episode is just some forgettable, artificial and generic melodrama that tries so hard to be tragic/sad rather than telling a good story. Reasons: 1) I don't care about a character that i just recently met. 2) Every episode have the same repetitive formula: Violet showing her prosthetic  arms → the side character is surprised  → Violet writing the letter and the drama starts. 3) Many of that side character have no personality besides of being just plot devices. I'm going to explain this much latter. 4) Many episodes are a just wasted of time that barely affect Violet. That's not 'character development'. The anime relies too much on tragic backstories to the point of being unrealistic. Also the story is pointless when suddenly changes to a poorly explained war story. Finally, the show seems addicted to start with the stories of the side characters instead of giving more backstory to our MC first.

The main character. Violet is a cute, innocent and stoic girl, i cannot deny that. But that the only decent traits of her. The anime tries everytime to make her look perfect for the sake of the plot. The most clear example is in the third episode when Violet goes to the school to be a Doll. She doesn't pass the course yet she pass after write some letters. Violet could accept his mistakes and later do the course again. It's too convenient. Another trait is that she is a killing machine super soldier. She can -for unexplained reasons- kill many trained soldiers easily. How she can do that? We never know. The prosthetic arms have no purpose in the story besides being pure shock factor -the way of how she gotten them is not explained-. I supposed that she can kill many people because of that arms but the flashbacks say otherwise. His character development is almost nonexistent, even after she learns the truth about Gilbert. The worst part is how she loses both arms doesn't really make sense. First, did she feel pain after losing both arms? A normal person never could carry someone after that inmense pain. Second, didn't she passed out of blood loss? And finally, the enemies only shoot them one time before being killed by Violet and Gilbert, rather than shooting many bullets in the first place. If the they're smart, Violet and Gilbert will be killed in seconds. Another similar scene ocurrs in the episode 12: the train hijacking. A unarmed Violet -she doesn't want to defend herself despite that she can be killed by armed guys- defeats many armed soldiers. Many of them are armed yet nobody shoots until is too late. Why didn't they just shoot Violet on top of the train? That not making any sense.......Finally, the anime poorly explain the origin of Violet. She is just a Mary Sue.

The Bougainvillea brothers. Gilbert is an army major and the love interest/father figure of Violet. The anime doesn't make it clear. We only known of him is that he is nice and a good person to Violet. He is nice guy anything else?. And then, Dietfried, the opposite of Gilbert. He is mean, rude and hate Violet. Also, he is the man who found her. His only trait is being a dick to Violet because she killed his subordinates -the context was never explained- and blames her for the death of Gilbert -something that makes no sense-. That is a bad plot idea to keep it relevent. The worst part is that the anime attempts to paint him as an angsty asshole in every scene rather than giving him decent traits. 

The CH Postal Company where Violet and other two Dolls works have some characters. The most interesting are Benedict and Cattleya. I like their chemistry and was one of the few decent moments in the entire show besides the animation. Sadly, they have limited screen time. It's feels like a wasted potential. Now, the other side characters that receive tons of screen time -in their episode- are merely plot devices or are poorly written. A random example from episode 6 with the character of Leon. He had discontent for Dolls, yet he was immediately enamored by Violet as soon as he laid eyes on her. Their only purpuse of is existence is to remind you that they are tragic people and nothing more. The animes fails to present a light-hearted story and gets repetitive. 

Mrs. Evergarden is the worst side character in the entire show. The first episode give us to understand more interactions with her foster daughter. Too bad. She disappears for 7 episodes and returns to explain a plot point and then disappears again. What is the point of her character?   

The villains from the last three episodes are just your typical bad guys. That was clear when one of them wants to torture a side character and in another episode he is giving us a evil smile to reminds us that he is bad guy.

The soundrack is decent in most parts, sometimes is forgettable anyway.

Finally, looking beyond the extremely good production (best of the season), interesting soundtrack, and amazing backdrops, there’s just not much there.  

Story 2/10 Bad written, emotionally manipulative, poorly paced and pointless. A lot of plot holes.

Art 8.5/10 Very good.

Sound 7/10 Passable soundrack, decent voice actors.

Character 1.5/10 Generic, bad written, little to no development.

Enjoyment 3.5/10 Boring.

The characters and story leave very little impression and it's difficult to become invested in a main character who is as close to an emotionless robot as I've ever seen. What intrigue existed in episode 1 with Major Gilbert and Violet's roll in the war has been pushed too far into the background and feels like it won't be revealed for far too long, and in it's place we are forced to sit through some of the slowest, uninteresting character progression I've seen in a while.

I wanted to like this

This anime doesn't need a review because it's a masterpiece itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Art 10/10
The sceneries are breathtaking and the character design are the greatest part of this anime as for the art. The places are well animated. Overall animation and graphics according to it's genres is perfect. I gave it's art 10/10 because of the sceneries and character designing (Violet's. Luculia's, Charlotte's and Leon's character designs, they are the best designs ever made in any anime).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sound 10/10
The soundtracks of this anime makes the environment feel-able and describes what's going on in the scene. The opening and ending are very beautiful and peaceful they suites as the
                  ...
anime is. The albums ""VIOLET EVERGARDEN: Automemories"" and ""VIOLET EVERGARDEN VOCAL ALBUM Song letters"" are worthy of being purchased by everyone who wants to listen to them.
(All these soundtracks and songs works as a ""booster rocket"" for the anime.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story 10/10
The reason why I came here to review Violet Evergarden is it's story. The story or you can say the life of Violet Evergarden teaches us the meaning of true humanity which is most important fact than any other in this world for a human. When I first saw Violet Evergarden I said ""I am going to watch another tearjerker anime"" even though I was right but I never knew the word I said ""another"" is too simple for this great anime. Violet Evergarden teaches us what happens if a human don't have any senses, feelings and emotions. What are the effects of a feeling-less human on other people and there relationships. They showed us the purpose of all important facts about humanism that what it means to be a true human being.

--Spoiler Alert--
The story of Violet Evergarden is all about the journey of a weapon/tool named Violet Evergarden how she learned humanism and became true human. A person who don't have anyone in the world, parents, family, relatives is living in an orphanage. Then fate sent an angel like solider named Gilbert who adopted her, gave her a name (Violet) and life while everyone took her as a living weapon without heart and soul but Gilbert say ""no"" because he never saw her other than as a human. Violet understand Gilbert and took him as if it is the only one she had left in this world. She always use to say ""Give me your orders"", ""I want your orders"", ""What's the next order"" and on the other side Gilbert always want her to get rid of thinking about the orders. Time passed and suddenly Violet lost her savior and both her arms in a war. The last thing Gilbert said to her is ""I love you"", that time she didn't know the meaning what he said, but she saved it in her heart. Now only thing she have left is Gilbert's memories, and the brooch of same color as Gilbert's eyes which is gifted by himself. She became an ""Auto memory doll"" and faced many difficulties and suffering in finding the meaning of ""I love you"". While searching she learned many things. She didn't know that she is teaching people more than she is learning from them. Every person she met she bring happiness to their lives. Thanks to the people who passed through her life, finally the day came when a tool who always say ""I want your orders"" and kill enemies like a ""heartless one man army"" is now became a ""girl"" who no longer needs any orders and say ""I don't want your orders"" and now even save her enemies from death.
Now she understands what Gilbert mean by ""I love you""...

The story of this anime is a lesson and anime is a teacher itself.

Characters 10/10
First I want to talk about the other special characters like Gilbert, Hodgins, Luculia, Charlotte, Leon and some other who have major role in building up Violet's life. I want to give 10/10 for character development for all the characters. And now for the ""The Battle doll of Leidenschaftlich"" the title given by the enemies in the battle field to Violet, what more honor can you get than that?! Violet has many qualities or we can say Violet is a rare person. Violet is Kind, Violet is innocent, Violet is beautiful, Violet is cute, Violet has the best heart, Violet is intelligent, Violet is a sign of good luck, Violet is happiness, Violet is sadness, Violet is a teacher, Violet is a student, Violet is brave, Violet is cool, Violet is a warrior, Violet is one man army, They give her a title ""The Battle doll of Leidenschaftlich"". What we need more than that to be a great characterization?...
I love Violet and all the characters in the anime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enjoyment 10/10
I felt happiness, I felt sadness, I felt love, I saw greatness...
I saw true beauty, I saw what it means to love, how love binds people even when they are far away from each other, I saw how much it hurts living through all the long nights in remembrance of someone you love while considering is never coming back. I saw sometimes you have to pay the ultimate price to achieve something great which you can't achieve otherwise. I saw and understood everything...
I never cried so much in my life as I cried while watching this show.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall + Importance 10/10
People of the world needs shows like this because humanity is fading and darkness is growing day by day among people. Violet Evergarden has ability to talk with people in psychological way and to help them to become a better person as human and this is one of the biggest reason why this show deserves a credit. Violet Evergarden's unique abilities makes it literally one of the best anime of all time.

I want to give my regards to Akatsuki Kana for creating this great anime and to everyone who ever watched this wonderful anime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the end I want to mention a YouTube comment of a friend when Kyoto Animation tragedy happened:

""I was in the US Military. My partner was a Civilian Medic and Biologist who worked in Warzones. We watched Violet Evergarden last year, and cried through it, watching the whole thing.


Because it very accurately described the feeling of trying to regain your humanity after seeing the worst of it. The feeling of being unable to breathe because of the overwhelming feeling of guilt and shame and terror that comes when you finally feel safe enough to.


I'm sitting at work crying because of the loss of empathy, the loss of humanity that this means for the world.


I am so sorry."""

Dear Reader,

I hope this letter finds you well. Much time has passed since our last correspondence and I humbly apologize for going silent this long. However, rest assured your patience has not been wasted. I am now able to relay to you, in full, my truest insights and reflections of Violet’s journey as I have experienced it. And in doing so, I believe you will be swayed enough to bear witness, yourself.

Visually, first impressions of Violet were quite favorable. She sported a slender face, flowing blonde hair, azure eyes, and a quiet disposition. Many would compare her to
                  ...
an idealized version of a dress-up doll. But as you know, first impressions can be deceiving. Upon listening to her speak, I and those around her quickly realized the doll analogy was even more appropriate. Despite her fair outer appearance, she was a shell of a person: cold and unexpressive. Her emotional development up until this point had been terribly suppressed from years of brutality and armed conflict as a weapon. Allowing herself to feel was a sign of weakness and that left her potentially vulnerable during the war.

But in these newfound times of peace, with no battlefield to return to, Violet became a lost puppy desperately seeking out new orders from her Major, Gilbert Bougainvillea, to validate her existence. Thankfully, Colonel Hodgins was there to pick up the pieces and guide her towards a brighter future. Without him as a guardian, I daresay, she may have been caged emotionally for the rest of her life. Under the employ of his CH Postal Company, it is from here that Violet embarks on an emotional odyssey, the likes of which were an absolute pleasure to observe.

Working as an Auto Memoir Doll, Violet struggled, in the beginning, to transcribe her clients' feelings onto paper. Her letters more akin to combat reports, consisting of direct and machinelike replies. While she was quick to acquire mechanical typing skills, her ability to sympathize and be sincere were lacking. Realizing an ineptness to do her job, she goes to her senior colleagues, Erica and Iris, for help. They too had trouble finding ways to relate to Violet at first. Nonetheless, as time passed and they shared their issues in becoming dependable Dolls themselves, the two become friends with Violet and gradually she opens up to them about her pursuit to learn what the Major meant when he told her “I love you.” At this juncture, she does not possess the emotional shelving necessary to support a feeling as significant and complex as love.

Further along, Violet begins to build a foundation for understanding the different forms love can take and improving her skills as a Doll. Sibling love, a mother’s love, a father’s love, a friend’s love, fated love, first love, unrequited love, blind love. With each new client interaction, Violet explores these feelings of love and unlocks another part of her emotions she previously kept sealed away. A few of these vignettes were awfully heart wrenching. In particular, the stories of Oscar, the playwright, who loses his only daughter, and Anne, a bluntly honest child whose mother is bedridden, had a profound emotional impact on me. I was reduced to a sobbing mess, even. Seeing Violet smile and cry for her clients, it is impossible not to empathize with their situations. 

As her travels wind down, Violet gets to a point where she is able to recognize what her emotional state means as it connects to a more abstract understanding of what it means to feel. When Hodgins eventually reveals Major Gilbert’s fate, she feels genuine anger and betrayal. In shattering her belief that the Major would one day return, a large part of her identity is lost. The scars of her past come back to burn her up inside now that she can contextualize her role in the war. Survivor’s guilt, self-loathing, and grief plague her conscience to the point where she regrets ever having regained emotions.

Violet’s pain and suffering cause her to believe it’s wrong for her to continue living. This leads to a climax where she speaks with Hodgins who forces her to confront the fact that just like the lives she has destroyed, the lives she has enriched cannot be undone. A difficult truth for anyone to face but it allows her to finally accept the reality. Despite still not fully grasping the Major’s love for her, she understands his intent and finds the will to carry out his final orders to live for herself. Ghostwriting as an Auto Memoir Doll becomes her purpose and though the Major may not be alive, he lives on in her heart. 

Presently, Violet is one of the top Dolls in Leiden. There are constant requests for her to ghostwrite letters from people all over the country. While physical beauty does not beget an inner beauty, I can assure you that her emotional maturity has outshined any outward charm she possessed at the outset. She has become a wonderful, caring, young lady and I personally cannot wait to see what her future holds in store.

In appreciation of KyoAni’s uniquely beautiful and detailed series, I chose to write this review in the style of a letter to prospective audiences. I wanted to have some fun and to give this a slight tinge of realism. I chose to focus solely on Violet and her character growth because a letter discussing sound and animation felt disjointed. Don’t get me wrong, the art and music are both deserving of extreme praise. I feel they’re best experienced for yourself, though. The show was not without its flaws but my gripes with the slow pacing, undeveloped side characters, and awkward action sequences didn't fit the letter either. Finally, it’s important to note that this is all from the perspective of someone with no prior knowledge of the light novel series or its plot. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed reading this. :)"

In episode 5 finally we get a ""sneakpeek"" of a very interesting background image of the main character and a most likely interesting future story (war based) . I won't vote the story yet because we don't know much of the series yet. Art and Sound are just incredible made especially the art is amazingly done. The characters are still not that amazing because I feel like we get some side character stories that we will never see again... but at least they do
                  ...
help violet to develop as a main character ( I think that's the purpose of those characters) . As for the rest of the ""main"" cast we havn't really got that much off them except maybe from 1-2.

                                      (11/13 eps)","I've read the reviews here and I am shocked. Not because of disparity or the scores, but because of the most stupid rule that has invaded the world of anime - the rule of three episodes. The idea that you can judge an anime series after just a handful of episodes is stupid and childish, born out of the idea that ""ain't nobody has time for this"". Tell me, if you don't have the time to watch anime, why do you even bother reviewing it?

The main aspect for which Violet Evergarden is being criticised is the story and main character. Judging these things after but
                  ...
3-4 episodes is unfair in this case. We start the story basically in the middle of the life of Violet, an emotionless girl about whom we know only that she has been in the war that ended not long before the show starts telling us the story. Often criticised elements here are the lack of backstory and a cold and empty vessel that Violet seems to be. We don't get the full story of what happened to Violet until about episode 8-9... wile up to this point the main character struggles to understand emotions of others as well as her own feelings. It is at the time we reach the episodes mentioned above that Violet finally breaks her emotionless shell fully. It is a genius move to push the backstory to a later time, as both the viewer and the protagonist have the time to acclimate themselves to the ideas presented here. The theme of love, loss and pain is strong enough to make even an asshole like me tear up. The way the story is presented eases the viewer into a false state of understanding the plot structure only to smash those expectations unexpectedly. It's some powerful stuff! 

Visually the anime is stunning. Backgrounds that most of the time are there only as decoration are vibrant and detailed to the point of trying a bit too hard. I couldn't find a single repeated animation loop in the entire show, so they're either well hidden or nonexistent. 
Sound, music, voice acting (both dubbed and subbed) are great as well. It shows that a lot of love and care went into making Violet Evergarden. For me, a standout will always be the ending theme that encompasses the character of Violet perfectly. 

When I first heard of this anime I knew nothing of the hype behind it, source material or even the studio responsible for the show. I just saw it on Netflix and given poor anime numbers on legal streaming services in my country, added it to my list. Violet Evergarden is one of the best anime of the year so far. For me, however, it's already one of my most favourite anime shows ever created. Just get yourself some tissues before watching..."

                                      (10/13 eps)","I have just finished episode 10 of Violet Evergarden and thought it was a great episode so I went to see on MAL if the ratings changed at all from this episode alone. It might have because before I saw it at 8.3 ish and now it's at 8.44.

After checking the ratings I decided to check the reviews see what that got to offer. I was expecting lots of 10/10's at the top or at least half positive half negative. But instead I found literally all the top reviews to be negative and people have for some reason all found it helpful. Well you know
                  ...
what fuck the guidelines cuz this is about to turn into a rant.

Story 10: As someone who didn't read the light novel and who DOESN'T CARE about the light novel I have to say: The foundations of this anime is **FANTASTIC** fantasy world, Great war, Kingdoms lots of great settings. The anime talks about Violet living as a doll after serving the military and living through tragedies. People are saying that ""every episode is just trying to squeeze the feel out of you"" well first off there's so so so many ""good"" anime's out there that does the same thing and the entire foundation of Violet Evergarden is practically based on that (this is a sad drama anime believe it or not). Every episode might look like a filler but it really is not it develops on Violets character ever so slightly in various ways and all the CHARACTERS FITS IN TOGETHER (GETTING TO THAT LATER). Literally don't get people who hate the story it's quite simplistic, straight forward and interesting. This anime talks about serious topics and sad events that does happens in real life such as: Orphanage, Losing a loved one in war, Illnesses, Integration etc. I have no complaints on this story and I truly **ENJOY** (GETTING BACK TO THAT) it.

Art 10: Astonishing. The settings just compliments this even more. Kyoani has been putting out great works recently in forms of Animes and Anime movies.

Sound 10: Amazing as well, fits the atmosphere and makes everything just more enjoyable.

Character 10: ANOTHER THING PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT WELL GUESS WHAT no. The characters has stuff that Violet never ever felt as a person and stuff that she can relate to. Such as having family, Being in love, Losing a loved one, Having a break down and many many other feelings and emotions. Also the characters kind of match up with the situation of Europe during and after the wars.

Enjoyment 10: Sad moments, happy moments, tense moments, Character development, many many many other aspects made me wanting a new episode every time I finish. This show really really struck me.

Overall 10: I might be biased because I started writing this review from my enjoyment alone. That might be a good thing or a bad thing you can decide. I was really mad and angry about the other reviews which is also why I started writing this review so overall if anyone is pissed or angry about my review well uh dm me a response on MAL or Jessechugaga#6564 on discord. Hopefully some people got to read this xd."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not RecommendedFunny,"After ep.10 I complained about this title to my friend and he told me that Violet Evergarden was written by an 18yo girl. Idk if that's true but it certainly is evident that neither writing  experience nor talent went into making this. The protag girl for some reason was intentionally made to be as dull as possible and in absence of any interesting supporting characters this makes the story utterly unenjoyable. What we have then is yet another KyoAni eye candy without substance (alright +1 star for visuals). 

So for the recommendation part: I would argue that if you're a 10+ year old male
                  ...
and you have a higher emotional intelligence than that of a hamster, there is not going to be a single second in this that will impress you.

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Violet Evergarden has been hyped to the max for the past year so there was a lot of anticipation built up for this show. This may have turned people away once it started because while audiences unfamiliar with the source material (like myself) were expecting something a little less slice of life and a little more action/war oriented, they were thrown off by the plot of the show being a little tamer than originally expected. I am not sure why they were expecting that since it was Kyoto Animation after all that animated this series and 99 percent of what they do is slice of
                  ...
life. That being said, nobody does slice of life as well as KyoAni and I must say that this is my second favorite series of theirs yet right after Hibike/Sound Euphonium (although it might be tied with Chuunibyou).  

Plot/story: Violet Evergarden is a show about a young lady (around 14) trying to figure out what her commander meant when he told her ""I love you"". You see, Violet was taught at a very young age how to be an excellent officer and her entire life was dedicated to her commander, Major Gilbert. She only looked to him for orders and was completely lost without him to order her around. One day, although actually night, while fighting a battle, they are both wounded and the commander pushed violet to safety right before a pile of rubble fell around them, seemingly crushing the Major. 
Afterwords, she becomes an auto memories doll, a person who writes/types letters at the behest of clients, whether it be a love letter or a simple delivery order. At first she isn't great at it because despite the fact that she is inhumanly fast on the typewriter, she has no empathy and thus can't transcribe the clients emotions into the letter. This series mainly focuses on Violets journey about her character development on learning how to emphasize with others through her letters. And this is where the series shines since it is done beautifully. We see Violets transformation take place throughout the series until the end when she figures out what love means and what the Major meant.

Animation: What can I say other than Kyoto Animation continues to amaze me with their animation. Everything looks beautiful and the attention to detail is impeccable and the action is fluid. This may be their best looking show yet. The face expressions and body movement and the colors are enticing to watch and look very realistic. My only nitpick is that a few of the male characters are hard to tell apart because the designs and colors are similar.

Sound: The OST is beautiful and blends seamlessly into the show. I really like the OST Torment but the entire OST is amazing. The OP is amazing with a great song Sincerely by TRUE (who also sings both OPs of Hibike/Sound Euphonium). It really sets the mood for the show. The main ED, Michishirube by Minori Chihara is another nice fitting song although visually it isn't as interesting as the OP. The other vocal OST tracks are also nice to listen to and also seam well into the emotion aof the scenes that they appear. I haven't heard the original Japanese dub but I can say the I thought the English dub was good if not great. The only voice actor that bothered me slightly was Violets but not because it was bad but because it was her character to not be emotionally invested, but later in the series I didn't have a problem with the voice acting.   

Characters: This is where many have trouble liking the show because Violet is the only character with a good amount of screen time and in the beginning, she isn't a likable character. But if you stick it out past the first couple of episodes be prepared for one of the best cases of character development ever told in anime. It may seem hard to believe that Violet changes so drastically in under 13 episodes, but the show is so well paced episodically and the changes in character are shown so intricately, that it isn't just believable, but done as well as could be. Each episode Violet learns more about emotions and how to show them or what certain feelings within her mean. In the beginning, she needed orders but in the end she makes up her own mind and doesn't need orders anymore. The way she coped with the Majors death in the middle of the show and the end of the show were drastically different. In the end, instead of being helped emotionally by others, she helped others emotionally. I could really go on forever about Violets character but I will move on. There are other minor characters that get development but I don't think they contribute much to the story compared to Violet. I will say that Major Gilberts older brother gets some development. The other auto memory dolls don't get a lot of screen time but they are fun to watch.

Enjoyment: This was a very enjoyable series which I could and will watch many more times in the future. I normally can't stand slice of life since I need to like the characters in order to be invested in what is going on but I am normally not sucked in by the characters. But this show pulled it off. I teared up multiple times throughout this show and I think everyone should watch it through to the end instead of dropping it at the first episode. Although a show can't be enjoyed by everyone, I really can't recommend this series enough. Watch it. It is on Netflix so it is easy to access legally. There is romance, drama, slice of life, action, and suspense so there is something for everyone to enjoy. 

Additional Comments: This show isn't perfect. I had small complaints occasionally and there was a lot of controversy in some moments. First, I hope there is a season two because there are plot threads which haven't been tied up yet. Second, there were times where Violet being only 14 (it is only an estimate in the show) was a tad unbelievable seeing what she did in battle at an even younger age and what she was doing in the show. Lastly, the anime strayed a little from the light novel in certain aspects. Some good, like the lack of magic, but some more controversial like the fate of the Major (and I won't get into more detail except to say that I personally preferred the anime version than what happened in the light novel). Also, I really like the world that this show is set in. I also really like the fact that there was a scene where a little girl confused Violet as a real doll as opposed to only an auto memories doll.

Overall: This show is unique and has something for everyone. While flawed with a weak beginning and controversial ending, it is definitely one of the more heart wrenching shows that anime has produced and I could watch this again and again and still enjoy it. I honestly believe from a technical standpoint (sound and animation), this show might be the best ever made. Please give Violet Evergarden a chance.

Story : 10/10
The story was marvelous. It mostly focuses on the main character of the anime, ""Violet Evergarden"". Although some scenes within the anime may be slightly timid due to the anime trying to adapt from the LN. The story is complex and it requires a fair amount of deep understanding.

what you would expect from a movie budget. 

Character : 9/10
Sure, the anime's genre is ""Slice Of Life"" which means that it mostly focuses on the main character's development. However, some other important people within the anime are lacking character developments. For an example, Hodgins. He deserved more CD. Other than that, the main character, Violet Evergarden's character development was flawless. 

Sound : 8/10
Both the opening and ending, as well as the soundtracks within this anime is  ""all right"". But it could've been better, sometimes the soundtrack in emotional moments are more like a background music instead of it expressing the condition of the scene. 


Enjoyment : 10/10 
This show is a perfection, I enjoyed it while it lasted. The main character is similar to me in real life, and it really touches me to see her develop as time passes. In which it inspired me to step out of my comfort zone. I shed tears in nearly all the episodes, sitting down on my comfy chair and watching Violet Evergarden is nothing more but an extravaganza.

Overall : 10/10
Violet Evergarden is my most favorite anime of all time, although I have moved on and seen many other anime. My feelings for this anime have never changed. I recommend everyone out there to watch this anime, you won't be disappointed. 

This concludes my review of the show ""Violet Evergarden"". Thank you."

For some reason it never came to my attention that watching landscapes was entertaining. I implore MAL to create a rating lower than dreadful just to scrutinize this atrocity. If I wanted to stare at a screen and watch pictures of scenery go by I would turn my desktop background to auto change and watch that. I wasted over 260 minutes pretending to be interested in the lifeless show that is viOlEt eVergAdEn.

                                      (9/13 eps)","Note to Anime: It is very important to make sure your viewers can easily tell whether or not your characters are human or highly advanced robots, especially when your world is set in a steampunk Victorian era and their occupation is literally called ""Doll."" 

Spoiler: none of the ""dolls"" are actually robots. Just girls training to ghostwrite. Why is it only girls? Dunno. Why do they have to be called ""doll""? Dunno.

Violet Evergarden. An anime that has all the glamour and musicality, but not a lot of sense. That was my review 2 episode into the series. The art is gorgeous, the music and voice
                  ...
acting are top notch. Animations are fluid and subtle. A pretty house that is furnished with terrible, dated furniture. The premise is cliche and the story makes little sense at times and tries way too hard to be ""thoughtful"" and ""touching."" 

How have things fared since the start of the episode?
Spoiler ahead.

In episode 2 we see violet send a letter that pissed off the client because she's a robot (not really but she acts like one and has robot hands). This was done in an extremely forced, and illogical way. For starter, Violet is new. And yet no one proof-readed the letter for her. They just let a complete newb, whom they know talk and act like a robot and have trouble fitting in, ghostwrite a letter on the company's behalf. Also, Violet was a soldier that relies on order. This being the first letter she ever wrote, you'd think she would ask someone if the content was okay. This is BS storytelling. Sacrificing logic for plot is weak writing and I honestly didn't expect it in an anime everyone has been raving about. 

Having re-adjusted my expectation, I watched two more episodes with a less critical eye and just genuinely trying to have fun. Unfortunately, this anime tries very hard to be dour and serious and touching, but ended up being very boring and devoided of fun and genuine moments. 

Think of an anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion. Aside from being really dark and twisted (also features a heroine similar to violet in the name of Rei), Neon Genesis is also fun and subtly touching at times (not ""everybody crying all the time"" touching, except Shinji because he's a crybaby) You can argue that the series becomes increasingly convoluted, confusing and overtly religious towards the end, and I'd completely agree with you, but the series, for the most part, had a simplistic story to tell, had interesting side characters, had a focus... all the while being tonally dour and smothering.

Violet Evergarden has a very similar tone. It is serious most of the time and almost completely devoided of laughter. I can count the number of fun moments I had between episode 3 and 4 with 1 hand. 

In episode 3, we are introduced to a girl named Luculia, who is good-natured and wants to take care of her brother since he was the only family she had left. This storyline had a lot of promise and had they taken the time to properly set up her struggles and motivations, the payoff would've been far greater. Then, somewhere in the middle of episode 3, she cried. Then towards the end of episode 3, she cried some more. Her brother also cried.

Episode four focused Iris, one of Violet's hot-head coworker, and her trip to her hometown. 10 minutes into the episode she cried and got into a shouting match with her mum. (how dramatic.) Another 10 minute she cried after seeing some dude who rejected her from way back. 

There is so much CRYING.

How is any of this ""touching""? 

The biggest mistake this anime makes is thinking that throwing a sad melody on top of someone crying automatically makes the scene touching. Nevermind letting the audience get to know the characters. Nevermind the circumstances. Just have them cry and your audience will cry along. Spoiler: It doesn't work this way. Instead, it ends up feeling really forced. 

There are some good moments in episode 4. For instance, iris asking Violet not to send the letter, and the very next scene you see is violet sending the letter. The dolls at the post office declared to have an official party, only to completely leave out their boss. Moments like this are very welcomed, and sourly needed in a show so devoided of light-hearted moments. Almost all the characters are cardboard cutouts. You can describe them in less than 3 adjectives. 

The characters talk, but you never get the sense that they're real people. Just mouthpieces to fabricate conflict. (except Luculia. She had Violet write a letter to her dead parents. She's the first real character I've seen on this show that felt real.) You barely get any meaningful insight into each of the character's life. What's iris like when she's not working? What does she like to do? It's four episodes in already and so far we barely got to know the main cast, beyond one or two descriptors. 

Violet Evergarden is like a beautiful piggy bank. The art is fantastic. The characters are pretty to look at. Great music and soundtrack. The exterior of the piggy bank promises riches beyond your imagination, and if you shake the piggy bank ever so lightly, you might even hear a faint rustle of coins or see a glitter of gold through the slit. 

When you break it open, however, there's nothing inside but pebbles. No story to tell. No interesting character or dialogue to keep you engaged. What you have is a story that doesn't really say a whole lot, but isn't really fun to hear either. 

if you're a teenager and this is going to be your first anime (or one of the first) by all means, watch it. It is pretty to look at, with all that filters and DoF and melodramatic soundtracks. If you are someone who grew up on anime, you can give this a pass."

Absolutely amazing production by Kyoto Animation. Never would I have thought that a 13 episode series would get me so deeply interested about a characters development. Every episode pulled at different heart strings from distress to love, from depression to beauty. Episode 10 especially has to be one of the best stand-alone epsiodes of any anime. Whether you've see the first half or if you go into it blind, that 20 minutes of animation will bring a tear to your eye. 

The concept for this show is really interesting and felt different from anything else. Definately one to look back on and rewatch

                                      (9/13 eps)","I honestly just want make a simple but enough review for Violet Evergarden. I was one of those people that honestly didn't give in the hype of the anime when the trailer and episode 1 came out. I simply stay neutral because I know if you expect something more out of it, you'll simply JUDGE it more than the actual anime due to high expectations.

When I was reading the reviews for Violet Evergarden, I see a lot of the people calling the story trash or it's slow. I think these are the people are the one that hypes it before it came out. I think
                  ...
the story is simply relaxing to watch. The pacing of the anime can be slow but I can explain why they're going to that route. Many people thinks Violet is a robot girl in which SHE'S NOT a robot btw. I don't even know why people makes reviews and get that wrong. Violet is a girl that simply don't know any emotions due to the fact that she's been used as a tool for war for her life. She simply didn't know what are emotions are and only knew how to kill. She lost her arms in the war and got mechanical arms. This is where I found the story starts to be interesting. She wants to be a ""Doll"" (who writes letter to people) and want to learn and find the hidden emotions that people and she has. She want to know what's the meaning of love and how is it feel to be loved. Every time she goes on adventure, she learns people's emotion and understands how people feel. While she SAVES other people EMOTIONALLY UNINTENTIONALLY, she's actually SAVING herself. You'll understand what I mean if you actually took the time to watch the anime. This is why the pacing is so slow for the anime. You can't expect a fucking person with no emotions to know understand the difficulty of emotions in 2-3 episodes. The story is simply relaxing and it's worth checking out.

If I do have to critique the series though, I'll have to say that they should have more episodes or find some way to wrap the series up because I don't think this anime should have a second season due to how the plot works. I hope they find a way to give a good ending that wraps the series up."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"In light of recent events, being the tragedy at Kyoto animation studios, I believed it to be fair to write a review for my favorite anime made by the company.

Violet Evergarden is a very distinct show which manages to explore emotional narratives that were never thought possible through anime. This is masterfully done through visual story telling and the flawless animation done by the people at Kyoto animation. Through their composition of every scene and character they manage to portray inadvertently key details which all supplement the plot. Take for example the parasol scene in episode 7, where Violet appears to almost have the aptitude
                  ...
to walk on water, this symbolizes so much in terms of the narrative, firstly it acts as a reoccurring motif towards the father and daughters relationship due to it being almost supernatural, surpassing any and all laws of space and time, as although she has passed away the father still appears latched towards her deceased daughter. Furthermore the scene also appears as a clear transition in Evergarden's character as she has finally come to a point where she is able to sympathize for one another rather than her residual perspective of being an emotionless 'robot'. A famous saying by philosopher Nietzsche stated ""if you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you"" and this almost seemingly comes into fruition in this episode, as due to Violet's ongoing effort to understand what human emotion is, she has now ostensibly appeared to have formed such emotions that she had once thought she was ineligible of having.

Now this is something that largely resonates with me. As prior to the news about Kytoanimation, I genuienly thought myself as some minor form of a  sociopath as  never had I felt any emotion after reading anything in the news, as I always shrugged off the tragedies of the world with the mindset of   ""sh*t happens"" and unknowingly so I'll admit I did the same thing after the news of the fire the first time I read about it. However it wasn't until my third reading of the same news article that I began to tear up, at first I had no idea what had provoked me to do so. But then it arduously dawned on me that this company had really brought me joy, and by no means am I an unhappy person I've always been quite happy with life being a high school student in a some what privileged lifestyle, so I'm not gonna claim the company helped me in the worst of times, cause that just isn't true for me, however what it did do was bring additional joy in my already somewhat joyful life. With shows like Hyouka, Violet Evergarden and Kobayashi Dragon maid (the latter for some reason hit me especially hard when I realized that this probably will never see the light of day again). However the sentimental affinity I somewhat shared with Evergarden's story of beginning inept with comprehending human emotion largely provoked me to write this review

Therefore I decided to write a review in such a manner which not only whole heartedly manifested my love for Violet Evergarden, but also brought my personal experience with the recent tragedy. So in conclusion if you have not seen Violet Evergarden, please just do, the narrative by no means is able to appease everyone especially those who like more action and comedy type shows. However the animation of the show is second to none, and the hard work the company did to make this into a reality deserves recognition, especially after the recent event.

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Mixed Feelings,"The battlefield.

Loud, deafening explosions numbing the senses. Rapid, unsteady breaths being taken by the soldier as they prepare for combat. With shaky hands they grasp their weapon tightly and launch themselves into battle. They quell the urge to run and steel themselves, for they know its either kill or be killed. The chaos of war and many a hectic skirmish have dulled their emotions and rendered them no more then a machine merely following orders until the bitter end. If by chance they are blessed with survival after the fighting has subsided, some troopers find themselves unable to regain their lost feelings even after returning
                  ...
to their peaceful lives at home. So even if they return alive and victorious, a part of their humanity died on the battlefield.

For the soldier Violet Evergarden, she seemed to never have any emotions to begin with. 

Molded from the beginning to be nothing more than a weapon for war, Violet finds herself at a loss when the fighting ends and she is forced to assimilate with society. After starting her life anew, Violet discovers that there is much about the world that she doesn’t understand. The most puzzling thing to her however are the final words she heard from Major Gilbert, her commanding officer: 

“I love you.” 

Having no knowledge of anything outside of the battlefield and being unable to contact Gilbert, Violet embarks on a journey to discover the meaning of these three words, all while gaining valuable insights on life from those around her. And through these interactions, Violet unconsciously helps her companions develop as people as well. This is a story about a girl who gradually learns what it means to be truly human. 

Violet Evergarden has an appealing premise with beautiful visuals and sound to back it up, but is it able to deliver? Well, that depends entirely on whether or not you’re able connect emotionally with the characters and plot of the anime. Now the show is designed in a way that tries really hard to tug at the heartstrings of its audience with each passing episode. However, Violet Evergarden isn’t just a collection of shallow dramatic moments that have no meaning when thoroughly examined. Otherwise it would ultimately fail as an anime. Instead, the show attempts to bring the cast to life by illuminating their qualities through a variety of ways, such as providing viewers with their backstories or showcasing their beliefs and vulnerabilities. Finally, the anime puts these characters in a situation where they are able to interact with Violet, thus allowing for both Violet and the rest of the cast to help each other develop as people. This characterization is important, because without it, why would anyone watching care about the struggles that the characters face? However, even with this characterization, many of the supporting cast barely have any screen time, so despite receiving some growth, most of the time it wasn’t enough for me personally to really feel for the characters. So then why did I find the anime’s presentation to be successful? Simple. 

It was because of the girl named Violet Evergarden.

Being the titular character, it would be odd for Violet not to be the best member or the cast. But her presence went beyond that. As I mentioned before, the troubles faced by the supporting cast really didn’t affect me on an emotional level because although the anime desperately tried to paint them as tragic characters who viewers should feel sorry for, there just simply wasn’t enough material on them for this to work in my opinion. What really touched me though was how Violet was affected by her interactions with these characters and how she was able to help change their lives for the better. In order to explain why this works for me, I’ll provide some insight on Violet’s character. First off, she seems to start out with no personality. Violet is, to put it bluntly, just like a machine in the eyes of others. Yet there is far more to her than initially meets the eye. Her journey begins when she decides to work for a former superior officer as an auto memory doll, which is basically someone who takes people’s words and feelings and uses them to write letters to others.

Now one of the issues that I personally had with the anime was its slow start. The first several episodes came across to me as quite slow, and I admittedly was initially bored with the whole Violet becomes an auto memory doll arc and was wishing that the anime would have instead showcased more of the war that Violet participated in. After completing the anime, I can now definitely say that my impatience was uncalled for and the direction that the anime took was superior to my own vision. This is because the beginning episodes were vital in showing Violet’s determination to discover her humanity and how she believed that her work as an auto memory doll would be the most effective way to accomplish her goal. We see her consecutively try and seemingly fail to comprehend the complex nature of human feelings. But she never gives up. And throughout her journey, she gradually picks up bits and pieces from those around her about how to understand emotions, and Violet eventually blossoms into a truly beautiful person.

The pinnacle of the anime for me would have to be the flashback episodes covering the war. Their placement near the end of the anime as opposed to the beginning like I initially wanted was a good choice. That way, viewers got to first go on a journey with Violet during the previous episodes and start to connect with her as a person. Then, when she finds out what happened to Gilbert and we get to see her past with him, we feel for her and can really see how far Violet has come as a character. For right before the flashback, Violet is shown to be feeling genuine regret for all of the lives she took during the war. Because through writing and delivering letters conveying emotions from one person to another, Violet realizes that those whom she killed will never be able to share feelings with their loved ones again. It seems like she has come far from her initial emotionless state. But honestly, I feel like these scenes, especially the one in the flashback where Gilbert reveals his love for Violet, show that she has always had feelings. I don’t believe that Violet was an empty husk who learned how to be human through her experiences, but rather a lost and confused girl who merely didn’t know what emotions were. Violet always apologized to her companions whenever she was unable to understand what they were feeling and attributed it to her lack of humanity, yet, no matter how subtle, she always expresses emotions of her own. Whether it be feeling bad for a friend or crying over someone else’s misfortune, the anime always showcases Violet feeling for others. Even if she doesn’t understand them, she has always carried these emotions within her. For Violet is not a doll, but a living, breathing human being. And deep down, she has probably always known what love is. Because its the way that she has always felt about Major Gilbert.

Violet Evergarden was an experience. While it may have overplayed the drama card, it still had many genuinely investing moments. Violet was a lovely character, and watching her develop as a person was truly heartwarming. Now some might think that the show is sappy, and others may feel like they can’t connect with the protagonist. For me personally however, I was immediately drawn in by the breathtaking visuals, and the touching plot and immense growth of Violet kept me happily watching until the very end."

After watching 3-4 episodes i was absolutely sure that this anime definately deserves the position where it is right now. It's also one of my favorites.

It's true certain aspects of a show can appeal more favourably to people depending on what they value. In saying that, I will focus on what this show does so well for
                  ...
me and why I consider it one of the best I've seen.

Story:
The introduction of Violet can understandably come across as odd due to the monotone way in which she addresses other characters. This may be off putting to viewers as I've noticed in some other reviews, but this set up is to a soon to be deeper story is just that: a set up. From what seems to be an ordinary show with a simple premise, rises one with humanity and heartfelt emotion. The character Violet is the canvas and each one of her encounters adds another layer of life to her story. I respect the writers for having the capacity to create these memorable moments through subtle recalling of other plot points that makes the show feel tied together. On top of that the dialogue has this poetic nature to it, whereby it doesn't attempt to add unnecessary complexity but simply lays bare the message it wishes to communicate. In all episodes i almost cried and even cried in 3-4 episodes wholeheartedly. The story is definately emotional but very well developed. 

Sound:
The sound was quite impressive. The soundtrack fits in really well with the anime.

Art:
The art was good most of the time. Backgrounds were filled with radiant colors and were nicely drawn.Character designs were also done well and fit well with the personalities of the characters.

Character:
I can't say too much without giving away plot points but the focus of the show is almost entirely on Violet, with additional characterisation given to those that appear from episode to episode. I have invested in this journey Violet is on, as I can see how her character grows each week as she experiences more of a beautiful world she has never seen. The character design are very good especially for Violet.

Overall: 10/10 One of the best."

First review, no promises of being good. TL;DR at the end for the anti-long readers.

To come from nothing.. No parents.. no siblings.. no pets.. no house. Having only 1 ability that keeps you alive and keeps you moving. That ability is to kill. 

Violet Evergarden, an emotionless child soldier with no background and no trust in her fellow man. She's renowned for her startlingly impressive skills as a killer and was often referred to as ""Gilbert's weapon"".

We meet our main character in a dream of hers with her Major, Gilbert. It happens to be one of many memories she cherishes of him because
                  ...
of a gift that shines the same color as his eyes. We then see Violet awaken from her memory-like dream and this is when our story with Violet begins.

What is one, who knows only to kill, to do when there is no war and no need for killing? As a child soldier she will now have to learn how to become.. human or what the military kids these days call a ""civvy"" (civilian). The hands she used to take lives will now be used to bring lives together... in a sense. 

**{{SPOILER}}** 
{{As Violet works within her new job she soon yearns to understand what the final words of her Major mean.. 「愛してる」or ""I love you"" and so begins her journey to become an Auto Memory Doll.}}

After Violet finishes her schooling (of course with some struggles along the way) she then travels with Iris, another Auto Memory Doll, to see what the work is like and to have an even better understanding of what her duties will be. As Iris and Violet arrive, Iris then realizes she wasn't hired by some unknown woman but instead hired by her mother. As Iris faces troubles with her family along with Violet not understanding why, the stubborn Iris finally gives in and explains her troubles and how she feels about the whole situation. 

After Violet helps Iris in her hometown she is soon hired by the Princess to help write a letter to her new husband. A man the Princess met a few years prior whom, she instantly fell in love with but never saw again. Violet is then tasked with writing letters of reply to the Prince but the Princess realizes that the letters, just like hers, are being written by another Memory Doll. The Princess, displeased because she knows these aren't the Prince's true words, opens up to Violet and at which then Violet asks for permission to overstep her position and help the Princess.

After Violet finishes her help with the Princess and has gained some fame as an Auto Memory Doll she's then hired by the Shahar Observatory. (Basically a big ass library that contains books on astronomy. Books are important kids make sure you read them even if they're manga.) Her job is to help re-write the old and deteriorating books as her partner, a member of the Manuscript Division, reads off the words she has to write down. I'd like to go into further details of the two during this but that would ruin a fairly good episode on Violet and what she's come to understand about ""feelings/emotions"".

This next arc again, I would love to summarize here but there's so much that relates to Violet's past that even mentioning a few lines would spoil it but what I will say is that these 2 episodes (7-8) have taken some the questions I wanted to know and answered them along with the theories I came up with and debunked them. I now catch myself eagerly waiting for the next episode to come to see what happens next. 

TL;DR 
Violet Evergarden is not for everyone. It's about a child soldier who only knows 1 thing, becoming a human-being in heart and soul. Some will hate on it because it's slow, some will even try to poke holes in it's plot and then deem it sh*t, some will even try to say Violet is dead and not building as a character at all. I say ignore all that and watch the anime to see for yourself. If it caught your eye and you're debating on watching it, just do it. If you don't like it, drop it. If you like it, GREAT! Just because a few people don't like it doesn't mean you won't either. They aren't you and you aren't them. 

Thanks for reading!! 

Note: My rating isn't official I only put one cause well I had to. It's a rating on how I feel at the moment and that can change when the anime finishes. When the anime does finish, I'll be changing the score but not here."

For a while I kept in touch with friends and former classmates by writing letters. While email has mostly replaced snail mail these days (and for good reason), it can't quite replicate the power of letters. Something about their physical limitations makes you weigh your words and topics more carefully; the excitement of receiving a letter is also ripened by the lengthy waiting time, making you cherish those letters even more.

The last anime I can remember that said something poignant about the sadly declining art of letter writing was one of my all-time favourite anime. Now
                  ...
there is another. Surprisingly, it comes from Kyoto Animation studio, whose flagship output for introspective slice of life anime is, err... ""K-On"".

In ""K-On"", KyoAni only managed to capture the superficial aspects of a slice of life; in ""Violet Evergarden"", it finally managed to capture the spirit.

The titular character of ""Violet Evergarden"" was a child soldier who served in the army during the great war. The story picks up where the war has just ended, with Violet - who has only ever known war - trying to find meaning in her life in times of peace as an ""auto memory doll"", a job about writing letters on behalf of clients.

The central theme in ""Violet Evergarden"" of ""emotionally stunted child supersoldier learning how to be human"" is a familiar one. It reminds me particularly of ""Full Metal Panic"", where Sagara Sousuke goes on a similar personal journey. But what's unique about this anime is how Violet's growth is tied to her letter writing job of being an auto memory doll. 

The job title ""auto memory doll"" might sounds like something perfectly suited to someone as robotic and emotionless as Violet, but the reality could hardly be more different. The job requires empathy to understand the client's innermost feelings, and eloquence to channel those feelings into the right words on paper. These don't come naturally to Violet, whose level of skill on the battlefield is matched only by her level of ineptitude when it comes to matters related to emotional intelligence. So the main challenge for ""Violet Evergarden"" is to convincingly show the benevolent cycle of Violet developing as a human being through doing the job, and how this in turn helps her to grow into the job.

It's a challenge that ""Violet Evergarden"" takes on with mixed results.

Where the anime fails to convince is in showing Violet's career trajectory. In the beginning, Violet has just about the emotional intelligence of a chair, and her way with words is limited to that of a military report. And yet somehow, within the space of a couple of episodes, she becomes a competent letter writer, and then proceeds to blow past her colleagues within another couple of episodes. By this point, she's spewing out letters of great poetry and beauty that catapults her into fame... all the while still in the infancy of emotional development and speaking like a military bot.

I can sympathise with this failing; the makers are in a catch 22 situation. In order to improve at her job, Violet needs to evolve as a person. But given her low starting point, you would realistically expect her to be so shit at her job that she's likely to either get fired or given little opportunity with clients. And without the opportunity, it's hard for violet for evolve. Something had to be fudged, and the anime went with Violet's career.

To the KyoAni's credit, ""Violet Evergarden"" does find success on Violet's personal development side of things, and it's here that the show earns its stripes as a genuinely good slice of life. It was Violet's superior officer during the war who, by treating her like a human being instead of a weapon, planted a seed of humanity in her heart. Through her (somewhat unbelievable) success as an auto memory doll, Violet got to meet all manner of people, and each of them has a story. Through listening of these stories, through participating in them, through writing the letters distilled from them, Violet's seed grows a little each time. Witnessing this slow but tangible progress in Violet and seeing her humanity eventually blossom is gratifying.

But it's not all about Violet. In fact, I was less interested in her (due to her character's familiar template) than her clients. Through the process of letter writing, Violet briefly opens up windows into their souls. For a few fleeting moments, their feelings and vulnerabilities are laid bare. This intimacy, this reveal of humanity through the mundane is why I love the slice of life genre. And in one of the show's finest moments towards the end, when Violet's thawing empathy for a young child's tragic situation threatened to drown her, I, too, found my eyes clouding with tears.

And all that makes it so frustrating that ""Violet Evergarden"" is an uneven show, especially in the second half. At times it's great, but at other times it struggled to rise above mediocrity. The main culprit is the resurgence of Violet's past. When this show isn't playing to its strengths as a slice of life, it unfortunately fancies itself to be a bit of an action stud. The action is a strange mixture of being sometimes over-the-top, sometimes underwhelming, but always boring. The exaggerated action and melodrama might not be so bad in a stylised military show, but it contrasts jarringly against the quiet drama of the slice of life sections. And then there's the last episode. In the middle of this most climactic, action-heavy episode, KyoAni's animation, normally so dynamic and lively, inexplicably became lifeless just as Violet also inexplicably went from a war machine to being ordinary.

Despite its significant problems, ""Violet Evergarden"" will probably be something I'll look back on fondly. Its appreciation of letter writing can only strike increasingly strong chords as the activity slowly dies out. As for me, life got busy, the letters writing dwindled away and, much to my regret, I lost touch old friends. But at least I still have those warm memories, and I'm glad that ""Violet Evergarden"" was able to bring them to light once more.

Personal rating: +1.0 (good)"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Emotion.
One of the most pivotal and important parts of our nature that makes us who we are. We feel things, good and bad, but these emotions are what makes us human, and can be very strong.

Words.
What we mostly use to convey emotions. Words give us ways to communicate and express ourselves to others, and is an a major gift that we humans created for each other.

Everyday there are many messages that we tell others with the use of these two things, sometimes verbally, sometimes using text, like an email or chat. Most people often converse with people on a daily basis, and it’s an important
                  ...
part of our lives, and nowadays we have the wonders of modern technology to give us long distance conversations without breaking a sweat. However, in the past, long distance conversations were not so easy, as we didn’t have technology to achieve that. So what did we do back then? We wrote messages physically on a piece of paper, and those messages were called letters.

Back then, when long distance conversing was more difficult. Letters were something sent only occasionally rather than constantly, and thus they were needed to contain and convey as many emotions and thoughts as possible through it’s words. Thus, letters were an essential thing back then, as they were the object that could bridge the distance between two people and let them convey those emotions through words, and thus held a lot of power and importance.

Violet Evergarden tells story is about a girl learning the truth and meaning of all these things, emotion, words, letters, and more. This is a coming of age tale, where a young girl named Violet sets out on a journey to about what emotions truly are, and why getting them across is so important. 

Story: 9

After a great war took place in the country of Telesis, the land is finally at peace, and returning to the state it held before the war. In this peaceful time, a girl wakes up, with arms of metal, devoid of emotion and waiting for orders. Our protagonist, Violet Evergarden, was originally a “weapon” that was given to Major Gilbert Bougainvillea to help win the war. He gave orders to the girl to do things, and she would execute them, mostly to kill or decimate certain troops. In the final battle of the war, both Gilbert and Violet were gravely injured, in where Gilbert told Violet the words “I love you”, and ordered her to live. Violet however did not understand these words, and collapsed in the battle.

Awake now, a former commander in the army close to Gilbert named Hodgins Claudia tells her that Gilbert entrusted her care to him for now, and that she should do her best to find a job and live a normal life. She learns about the job of an Auto Memory Doll, an occupation where they will write things for people with a typewriter, often letters, scripts, and more. After learning about the occupation and how much it’s tied to conveying emotions and words, she chooses to become one, and the show then follows Violet’s journey as a doll, to learn more about emotions, and to learn the meaning of the words that Gilbert left her with. 

This show starts off slow, and I mean sloooow. Half of the first few episodes are mostly worldbuilding and setting up the characters and their occupations, without giving much actual development into any of the characters. This does not help because Violet initially starts off being completely emotionless and blunt, to the point it could be frustrating how she can’t do tasks or talk to people properly due to it. It is an obvious that it’s an intentional detail, and it makes sense why, but that doesn’t help make the show feel so slow at the first few episodes.

However, once the show hooks you in, it does a good job at keeping you in. After the first few episodes, the show switches more to an episodic nature, where Violet goes to different places to do her job at being a doll, introducing new characters and new stories that are concluded by the end of their episode. For the majority of the first 3 episodes does not develop very much, but by the end of the third episode, she shows her first sign of growth, as simple as it is. After that moment, the show begins it’s episodic nature, and by each one, she slowly grows as a character and learns more about emotions. As that happens, she becomes easier to enjoy as it becomes a lot easier to emphasise with her through following her experiences. By episode 5, I was personally hooked, because Violet had finally shown enough growth where she was easy enough to care for her. 

Due to how episodic the show is, it has a lot of substories that take place, where each character has a problem and it’s up to Violet to help them out of it, be it by writing messages, talking to the characters, and interacting with them. These mini stories tend to be extremely heartwarming, as most of them use close relationships people have with one another as a theme. They are relatable, and extremely engrossing at times, letting you care for the characters and their problems a lot in the short amount of time they take up. By the end of the episode, the characters end it satisfyingly, and it can get really emotional seeing the characters’ state by the end of each one, but more on that later.

It had a slow start, but since then, it only got better and better with a few episodes slowing down the quality. I can only say, trudge through the first third or half, it might be hard, but it’s intentional, and you’ll find it absolutely pays off later. If you aren’t hooked by halfway, feel free to drop it, but until then, let the show dig down it’s roots. Because afterwards, the show will begin to really shine, and it’s quality does not disappoint as Violet goes through great amounts of growth, and the stories she takes parts of can get extremely heartwarming or emotional. 

Art: 10 (Can’t do an 11 damnit.)

Hoooo man this is pretty much as close as you can get to an objective doozie, no question about it. Alright, take A Silent Voice’s animation, decrease the precision linework quality for the TV budget, and instead replace it with a more stylised, wavy, paint-like aesthetic. Add lighting and colors of that of an artist’s painting, and give it impressive sakuga-like animation throughout the whole show that emphasizes all the small details and movements in almost every scene. What do you get from that? You get this show’s art style, and it stays at that quality the ENTIRE TIME. 

I do not kid you when I say this is easily one of the best looking anime, if not THE BEST looking anime that I have ever watched. The art style is nothing less than amazing, it’s like cocaine for your eyes. The animation is just downright gorgeous, from the color usage, designs, detail, and movement, it’s almost like like an animated painting. I have honest to god trouble imagining how the heck Kyoto Animation did this, especially for the budget. They seem to have changed the art style to be more inconsistently-based yet remaining beautiful and stable, make it easier to animate rather than cut back on the art itself. 

This show looks amazing, the actual art is full of details and touches that make it look so graceful. The lighting, I cannot emphasise how well they did the lighting, it is perfect, scenes look convincing and real. It’s easily one of the best looking shows I’ve ever seen in my life, and I cannot merely describe how amazing Kyoto Animation did on this. They have absolutely outdone themselves even more so than usual, and they deserve a serious bravo for their efforts.

Sound: 9

The sound effects done by Kyoto Animation is completely solid, but first I’ll talk about the score. The music tracks are mostly serene with really well played out tracks that use a variety of music. There isn’t a lot of quick paced music, and only occasionally there are some dramatic tracks with orchestra for the scenes that require some intensity in it, but most of it works to either set the tone of the scene, or to pull at your heartstrings. Nothing really stands out especially, but I mean that in a good way, since the OST overall is extremely good and nothing is unfitting. 

I will say, the opening Sincerely is really well done. True’s vocals are godlike here, reaching a smooth, classy tune that works well with the instrumental. The lyrics conveyed Violet’s emotions so well, that as I watched the show, I found the song getting more emotional as I got to understand and get attached to Violet herself. The ending song also deserves mention, and while personally, I like the OP more, I can’t deny that it’s done just as well, with vocals that give it a feeling of nostalgia and maturity. The insert song Violet Snow is also an insert song that really helped some scenes shine, it had a feeling of youthful hope similar that of a fairy tale. 

The actual sound effects and foley are really what pushed this thing to such a high score. Little details are realistic and well thought out, and sound convincing. I want to bring special mention to everytime Violet uses her metallic hands and the sounds that are made during their movements, Stuff like that elevate the sound to a high degree, even if most of the tracks themselves don’t stand out with the exception of the few. 

Character: 10

The characters are simply amazing and absolutely made the show for me, although it’s not apparent at first. In the first two episodes, Violet is absolute cardboard due to the way the story is structured, with no personality whatsoever, and blunt to the point it’s inhuman (which is the point). The supporting cast in the first two episodes are the main recurring cast, and don’t have a huge amount to them, you get to understand their character types, familiarise with them, but that’s it. They don’t have a lot of depth to them, and are admittedly for the most part, just supporting cast that occasionally plays a role in certain episodes depending on the circumstance. They don’t develop often with the few (surprisingly notable) exceptions, and asides from their personalities, don’t add too much in the initial episodes.

However, what the recurring supporting cast lacks, is made up in the episodic supporting cast. Remember how I said a majority of episodes follow that episodic format? Where a shorter story takes place with characters that are only really relevant in that episode? Well, it’s these episodes where we’re introduced to the characters that really help make the show so great in terms of it’s story, but to do that, I also have to explain the other factor.

That other factor, is Violet herself. As the show premise suggests, her goal is to learn more about emotions, and learn to understand the meaning of the words Gilbert left with her. As I’ve stated multiple times before, she begins with no personality whatsoever other than pure, inhumane bluntness, and no self worth. She acts like a robot, a tool, which was exactly how she was meant to be, and Kyoto Animation portrayed her in that state perfectly, at the cost making her unrelatable, hard to emphasise with, and hard to like from the get go.

However, as the show goes on, she slowly begins to develop. She slowly learns emotion, bit by bit, and how does she do that? By helping out the supporting characters with their problems through the letters and writings that she creates. She is the trigger, a catalyst that allows for the supporting characters to either develop immensely, or allow the viewer to emphasise with in each of their respective episodes. She helps them to conclude whatever problem they have by the end of their episodes, and through this, Violet herself develops by witnessing and helping these supporting characters. Eventually, she becomes more human and relatable as each episode goes by, learning more about emotions, what it means to be human, and what love truly is. She develops so much and learns so much, and by the end of it, both the supporting cast and Violet herself come out stronger than they’ve been before the episode began, all because they were each there to help each other. 

This dynamic made the show immensely heartwarming and enjoyable for me, to see so many touching scenes with the characters from the support of Violet, and for her to learn about what it means to be human through these events. This process was amazing and made for some extreme growth for both parties. I was able to emphasise with both the episodic supporting cast and Violet herself to an extreme level. Watching Violet grow so much in so many different ways, and see her learn both good and bad things, become stronger through that, and emphasise with her, has made her evolve into one of my favorite characters in all of anime, and that is something to say.

Enjoyment: 9

The first two or three episodes were really slow, and at first I wasn’t having fun with the series very much. It was mildly entertaining enough, but due to the focus worldbuilding, in trade of lack of initial depth and relatability to any of the characters. Without any hook for my interest other than the art, I wasn’t a fan of it at first. However this is an show that builds itself over time, and as that time goes on Violet herself and the supporting characters make this show what it is. After the initial slowness, once Violet starts her development, the show keeps improving by developing her every episode, letting her help others, let them grow, and in turn she grows more herself. 

It’s when this happens, the level of enjoyment skyrockets far past the slowness of the initial two episodes, and it keeps that quality for the majority of the remaining run. The ending was also satisfying as hell, and while I could have some more stories of Violet doing her job, the show itself does not need anything more, as by the end, the story does everything it sets out to do, and ends on an extremely conclusive and satisfying note. It wasn’t fun at first, but once I managed to enjoy myself, I could not stop having a blast.

Overall: 10

Violet Evergarden is a show that really, really got to me in the end. Art-wise, no question about it, it is godlike and little will compare with it other than high budget movie animation, or Kyoani’s future works made after the writing of this review. Story-wise It does have an extremely slow start, with no character to emphasise with at first, and only worldbuilding to go off of. It sets the tone and setting well, but does nothing to make you really care for it other than maybe the supporting cast’s quirky personalities, or maybe the potential for the show to kick off later on.

However as I’ve said, the show absolutely kicks off later on. Once Violet begins that first step of growth, and sets out to do her job, the sub stories and the characters in it all make the show as good as it is. It’s a mixture of the extreme overall development for the majority of the the characters that take part in the stories, the heartwarming tales that result from the problems that get resolved in each episode get more and more emotional as you see Violet grow and understand the true impact and meaning that emotions can hold. 

I randomly brought up two terms and explained them at the beginning of this review, words and emotion. That is because, this show has made me appreciate these two things so much more than I did before watching it. Emotions are what make us human, and as Violet has shown, allow us to emphasise, feel, and care for one another. Words, a tool for communicating to one another, allowing us to convey these emotions to one another. The way Violet uses her letters to change those around her, and change herself, is what makes this show an absolute masterpiece. The importance and meaning that these things possess in our lives is immense, and they can create some very impactful moments.

Violet Evergarden is a story about the importance of emotions and conveying them through words. It’s a story where people grow from the actions and support of others, and the importance of the relationships we have with one another. We affect each other’s lives, and change each other, and that is why I hold Violet Evergarden in such high regard. By the end of the show, Violet has evolved so much, and it made me so proud to see the growth she had gone through when all was said and done. I highly, highly recommend it to anyone, even though you’ll have to trudge through the first few episodes, because once you do, you are in for an extremely emotional, and touching ride.

PS. I teared up quite a bit while writing this review, and became a sobbing mess while recalling all that made this show hit so close to home by the end. This was not an easy write up to go through, I'll tell you that much."

                                      (4/13 eps)","As you know already, Violet Evergarden has been the most talked about anime of this season and unfortunately it has become one of the mistreated anime on this site. Now I know this MAL after all and in all honestly I can understand why a lot of people find this anime disappointing. However, for someone like me, this anime does work for me while most others it doesn't. And the reason for this is because most people who have been criticizing this anime don't understand what kind of story this is and they don't take the time to try to understand. This is problem with
                  ...
the anime community and today's generation for they have never a situation that Violet and some of the other characters have gone through.

Violet Evergarden is not your typical anime and it was never meant to be. This is an anime that has a far deeper story than pretty much any other anime out there. If you were expecting this to be some kind action show or even a war drama, then you were either misinformed or assumed too much. Now I myself have never read the LNs in which this anime is based on and I am aware that there are some differences such as the additions of character not in the original story, but at least let me give you an idea of what this anime is really about.

EASY TO UNDERSTAND
While I did mention that this show is about self-discovery, it also about dealing with PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, originally known as Shell Shock. And considering that the anime has a post World War One setting, it makes perfect sense. Let me give you a little history lesson.

PTSD is something that's existed since the beginning of mankind, but WW1 was where people really started to research it, hence the original term Shell Shock. If you look up any videos about WW1 veterans suffering from shell shock and saw how they reacted to sometime they either see or hear on the battlefield as the doctors and scientist were doing this research, you'd be pretty shocked yourself. Believe me, it's not a pretty sight. And there's usually two outcomes when it comes to dealing with PTSD. The person either recovers or commits suicide.

While this anime doesn't go deep into this subject it still addresses both it and its effects, as is evident of episode with Luciuia's older brother. That man could have easily taken his own life due to his depression, but he didn't. And that was because Violet saved his with her not even realizing it. This is where the anime really does shine.

EASY TO FOLLOW
Violet Evergarden herself is the most misunderstood character in this anime, just like Dorothy Catalonia is the most misunderstood character in Gundam Wing. The people who have been criticizing this anime put a lot of that blame on Violet. They either call her boring, bland, or both. Well, I hate to say it but those people are forgetting what Violet is. She practically is a robot at this point. She's been a soldier all her life and she know nothing else. Not only that she's been used and abused all her life. And to top it all off she's lost both her arms and the only person she's ever had a bond with is dead(presuming that he is) and his last words to her were, ""I Love You"".

If you really think about it, Violet is practically Darth Vader but with Data's personality. In Star Trek TNG Data was trying to discover what it's like to be human while living in a mechanical body. For Violet it's a more specific goal: Trying to discover what the meaning of ""Love"" is. Try putting yourself in her shoes. You've lived your entire young life taking other lives in violent ways while seeing nothing but death and destruction around you. Then your commanding officer dies, despite you trying to save his life, and he says those last words. You then wake up in the hospital and discover that you're part machine now but those fateful words are still with you. Wouldn't you want to discover what those words meant?

EASY TO CARE ABOUT
What people are not understanding is that Violet is still a child, and a very innocent one at that. Yes, it may seem annoying to some people but until now she's had no mind of her own. Now she's starting wake up to that. So the question becomes as this series goes on is how she's going to deal with it when she starts to feel emotions?

When I really think about it, the story isn't just about Violet. It is about the people around her in a world that is trying to move on from a devastating war. This is what the last episode of The Pacific was all about, showing the aftereffects of the war the characters fought in. If you grew up in military family like I did and spoken with veterans like I have you would understand this well. Violet has yet to realize that her existence and what she's trying to accomplish may bring a great deal of change in the world and bring peace to those who were effected by the war. 

A story like this has to take its time to develop and unfortunately this doesn't work for most anime watchers. With the way its going now it may look formulaic and even predictable. Some I'm sure will think that the episodes are nothing but filler, but I'm pretty convinced that the final delivery will be very much worth it in the end. If I were to provide an example of what kind of story this is I strongly recommend an old movie from 1946 called ""The Best Years of our Lives"". Watch that movie and then maybe you will understand this anime better.

It's very rare and very risky to make an anime that isn't what you usually see in this media. And that's the reason why I like this anime and why I will be sticking with to the very end. Hopefully you'll come to understand it as I have. For now I'm only going to give this anime an 8 since it's too early to tell if this show will be a masterpiece in terms of story telling. I do believe, however, that it has all the potential to be one.

I'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!"

FULL REVIEW

STORY [9/10] - Where do I even start, First off I am an army veteran... a full grown 26 year old man and this story had me crying almost every episode. The look at the consequences of war not just on the soldiers but on the populations affected is deep and heart shattering to witness. The story doesn't leave you on the edge of your seat with action or fight scenes...It instead smacks you in the face with pure and raw emotion. The story is completely unique and the world is fleshed out enough that I can feel apart of it, there isn't much deep lore to go along with the show but the setting is not the focus at all in this show. It instead focuses on the journey of our MC violet and she is more than enough to carry this story...In fact I think focusing on anything else would have been a loss. The story is very loose with an overarching narrative but focusing very heavily on violets interactions with the world as she tries to figure out who she is after the war. There is very little filler in this show as you ride from one emotional rollercoaster to the next, anxiously waiting to see violet grow and find true happiness and peace. The story was amazing and I believe it is as close to perfect as it could possibly be.  ____________________________________________________________________

ART[10/10]- The art style in this show is breath taking. Every character is gorgeous and full of personality and emotion. The cities, forests, fortresses and all other settings are phenomenally drawn. I found myself pausing the show to admire; the detail in the night sky, the strands of fur on animals in the forest rustling in the wing, the snow falling to the ground to roll off of leaves and the characters faces, the sun reflecting in the characters eyes as they talking during an emotional moment or the visceral fight scenes where the punches , kicks and stabs all have such impact and weight. I could go on and on about all of the details and all of the beauty that is packed into this masterclass of art and design in anime or any animated work. In my opinion this could not be better, the creators of this anime should be praised for years to come, this was beautiful and I will remember it for years to come. 
____________________________________________________________________

SOUND [8/10] the OST for this anime is presented extremely well and does everything a soundtrack should. During the emotional moments the angelic and mourning tones crescendo into spats of musical climax that fit the on screen moments perfectly. During fight scenes the music helps grow the suspense and pulls you to the end of your seat, the bass hitting with each punch and kick. during joyous moments the upbeat tones and notes seem to cement the happiness the characters are feeling and make me want to dance and cry all at once.. nothing to complain about here. It was a very well done soundtrack for an amazing anime. 
____________________________________________________________________

CHARACTER [9/10] Another amazing aspect of this heartwarming story. The MC is interesting and loveable. She is someone you want to root for and you will not be happy if she doesn't get what she deserves. Watching her is a story of struggle and triumph. Violet is a caterpillar struggling to break free of her cocoon and all of the supporting characters are tools to push forward her evolution and growth. Of course the other characters has personality and you will cry and mourn for their hardships but you will always come back to violet. She is the story and damn does she make a good one. By the end of the show violet felt like a part of me, I  was invested in her and to see her story unfold was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time, I loved her and she will be one of my favorite characters for years to come and will be really hard to surpass

                                      (5/13 eps)","The plot of Violet Evergarden is simple enough.  It's about a girl named Violet Evergarden recovering from war, and working as a doll.  Dolls are women who write letters for those who can't write their own.  They're usually love letter and heartfelt letters full of feelings and emotions.  This is a dilemma for Violet as she doesn't really understand complex feelings.  Though as she goes to school and writes letters for people, she starts to improve and understand emotions more.

The good things about this anime is the production value.  The English Dub voices are actually good.  The sound
                  ...
track is great.  The art is freaking gorgeous, along with the animation.

That's where the compliments end.  The anime is a like a lackluster gift, wrapped in beautiful wrappings.  When you see the fancy and expensive gift wrapping, you think it'll be a lovely present.  Then you open it, and see a pair of fuzzy socks.  This anime is very boring and the characters aren't very compelling.  The main character is the most boring of all!  One dimensional characters surrounding a boring MC is just boring.

It's episodic, so it's like a new problem every episode that's easily solved.  The tension is false.  To be honest, I wouldn't even mind lackluster tension, if the writing of the characters made up for it.  Though once again, they're one dimensional characters...  The character explorations of the characters are like a shallow pond.  The backstory is there, but it isn't deep at all.  There's no depth to them.

I dropped after watching episode 5.  It was a rather gross episode, but the anime tried to paint it as great.  Someone once said that the most damaging thing you could ever to do a kid, was showing them something bad while painting it as something joyful and fun.  That's all I'll say about episode 5, which made me drop it."

Violet Evergarden is a dialogue driven drama that became my ""weekly dose of uncontrollable crying"" since ep. 5. You can't expect a show about a girl that writes letters to be an action packed sakuga fest because you saw a trailer with some sequences of war. This is a psychological ""coming of age"" story about different forms of love and about overcoming ptsd. It is what it is, so it must be judged by that, not by vaguely founded expectations.

Very good story, good writing and a great deal of originality. You won't really find cliche character tropes. Violet is a complex continuously evolving protagonist and the rest of the cast is believable. This is as much as I go, because I'm struggling very hard to not go into spoiler territory.

Art: 10
As far as I'm concerned, Violet Evergarden has the best art in the history of episodic show (close to film level quality).

Sound: 9
The OST has mostly soft and highly emotional pieces that generally feature stringed instruments. The songs are really well timed and greatly increase the emotional scenes.

Character: 10
Since this show is about Violet, this mark is for her alone. Episodic characters are good, but Violet is the only one that matters when you think about character development in this show.

Enjoyment: 10
As I said, this is my ""weekly dose of uncontrollable crying"" .

So, just another thought: If you can't sit through dialogue and have a level of empathy lower than a rock, this show is not for you. But if you want something to make you spend all your pocket money on tissues, then you should definitely watch Violet Evergarden."

                                      (4/13 eps)","Be advised; this anime is probably gonna be hit or miss. either you will enjoy it very much, or find it very dull. if you like anime similar to Girls Last Tour and other slow, thoughtful shows, you may enjoy this anime to unwind to. it's only getting stronger every episode, and some drama seems to be brewing

What is it?
it's a series of little tales, not about the main character Violet, but those around her. Violet herself is dull, and her personal growth is perhaps slower than it could have been, but her job is to act as a foil. through her, we see things
                  ...
differently. the personal issues and feelings of the episode-protagonists are wholesome, simple and pleasant to watch. because of this rather simple content, you will have to enjoy that sort of thing because so far, thats what the show has to offer you, the viewer. 

The First Episode;
watch it
The first episode is pretty much a 20 minute long animated short, and can be enjoyed on its own, even if you do not intend to watch the series.
the anime is, as you may already know, gorgeous. its a lovely experience, and a nice breather, with its delicate and thoughtful nature, making a solid series that never slacks in quality

give it a whirl before nighttime with a cup of tea, and relax a little, sometimes less is more"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Empathy. That is the key characteristic of this anime. To empathise with people is understanding your own feelings and that is what Violet Evergarden skillfully achieves.

The show consists of short stories where Violet (MC) writes for people all around the country for various reasons. And their stories are sweet, sad, lovely with a dab of heart crushing. The writing and directing of the different forms of love, was so incredibly sincere and heartfelt, making Violet significantly grow emotionally as a character.

Violet evergarden will be known for its great visuals but what struck me is its incredible sound design. So much care was put into every
                  ...
sound which really makes the world come alive. So much that the music can get distracting initially. But don’t get me wrong the music is great, its soft and elegant, which just adds to the beauty to the whole show.

In the end these type of anime have their own genre, as slice of life, emotional, drama. And this anime will be the thumbnail for all of them."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Many protagonists in animes have a driving ideal or motivation in their journey, seeking to complete their goal. In Violet Evergarden's case, Violet starts her journey because she wants to ""know what love is."" These words were given by someone special to her. This story follows Violet's life post-war as an Auto-Memory Doll, someone who translates their client's thoughts and feelings into a letter.

Violet Evergarden is a beautifully crafted and written anime, and I don't mean just KyoAni's visually, stunning animation. If we look past that, Violet Evergarden's plot is crafted so well together. Violet learns different emotions and displays these emotions by ""ghost-writing"" letters
                  ...
for clients as an Auto-Memory Doll. The ""one-episode"" (mostly) short stories create and build upon Violet's character. Not only are the short-stories amazing for how short they are, they create Violet's character and helps her reconcile her past. As the story progresses, the letters she writes helps her grow as an Auto-Memory Doll, fully abled to comprehend humans' emotions. 

During her journey, she also meets people who suffered due to the war, and she also meets people completely unrelated to the war - but regardless they both give her memories of her sorrowful past. She grows from these experiences and stories and becomes more aware of the world and what she has done.

This show is all about feeling empathy for these characters, and the amazing visuals and subtle yet powerful OSTs helps evoke that emotion for the viewer. Although the series is only 13 episodes, and I've heard that the anime cut a few parts that would make this show even better, its pace is very slow and enjoyable to watch. It explains to the viewer that you should enjoy every single moment in life, every happy moment, even the sad ones.  The hardships and happy moments that Violet faces show that life is a battlefield; life can flip over at any time. 

Watching episode after episode, it never continued to surprise me and learn more about Violet. Almost as if I'm Violet herself. After Violet's extensive and tiring journey, all good things must come to an end. Violet Evergarden will always hold a special place in my heart, like a letter given to me by a special someone.

I'm sorry if I wasn't able to fully explain how great and special this anime was. Like Violet, I think it's pretty hard for me to give my whole honest opinion on my feelings about this show. Hard to write my feelings on a letter. Anyways, I am especially excited to see the new movie, and I'll give my opinion if I feel enthralled about it. Thanks for reading my short review on Violet Evergarden."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Originally a light novel written by Kana Atsuki, Violet Evergarden won the grand prize in the 5th annual Kyoto Animation Award in 2014, which probably heavily contributed to its tremendous hype. Four years later, in 2018, when KyoAni, a studio highly regarded for its beautiful art and animation style (and for actually drawing noses...), started airing their adaption of Violet Evergarden, many viewers were left confused, with pretty controversial opinions regarding the show. Having just finished the show, I'd like to add my two cents on it.

Violet Evergarden (further abbreviated ""VE"" for conveniency) headed into the 2018 Winter Anime Season with an enormous amount of
                  ...
hype, even landing itself a place on MAL's top 30 anime list before it aired (if you care about MAL rankings). Personally, having not read the LN and judging the series solely on the synopsis (not a big fan of PV's), I honestly wasn't too hyped. Add this to the fact the Netflix bought the rights to it, I was looking forward to the new Hibike! Euphonium movies more than VE. 

Now when episode 1 aired, I was completely taken aback. Minutes into the first episode, I was completely entranced, when Violet's pen dropped, and the wind dramatically blew a letter she was writing (by hand) into the skies, where it fluttered around for quite a while in a Disney-esque manner, with KyoAni showing off their animation and background artwork (once again). Unfortunately, KyoAni didn't really follow a great first episode with a great second episode, but nonetheless, the feeling that the first episode gave me definitely stuck with me. This immediately became a show where I would eagerly await the next episode, even through the more boring episodes.

Now in regards to MAL's 5 rating categories, I will admit that I will look at everything both objectively and subjectively, but I assure you that I won't be unreasonable. So without any further ado...

Story- 8:
First off, I'll probably save some of the story for the character sub-section, since characters develop because of the story.
The story of VE was probably one of it's weakest links, that is, if and only if the watcher is looking for some overarching plot that connects the beginning to the end. Whereas VE does have this with Violet's journey which will ""reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery"" (MAL's synopsis), the end point isn't what makes the story of VE special. Instead, the anime adaptation takes an episodic approach. In other words, VE is a story less about how each episode manages to contribute to the plot, and more how each episode contains a story that happens because of the plot. To elaborate, it's not that Violet writes letters for other people as a doll that makes the story of VE great, but instead that because Violet is a doll, she is able to make the interactions with other people (that have quite a bit a ""feels"", IMO). Because of this, VE seems to sometimes lack a flow and direction (especially in the first few episodes). The episodic approach sometimes causes problems with the pacing, which makes sense, considering that some stories are better, more significant, more important, etc. than the some of the other stories, and giving them all equal screen time means the pacing might be off. Generally, however, I feel like the more touching episodes had pretty good pacing, and managed to use all 20 minutes wisely. Despite the simple plot of Violet trying to find out what love is, her interactions with people through writing letters for them really makes for a lot of emotion. Some might find these interactions melodramatic, and consider it to use way to much Pathos, but I found these scenes quite touching. Personally, the episodes that were good (pretty much everything past ep 4) managed to excuse some of the earlier episodes that weren't as good and some plotholes (more on this in character section), which is why I give it an 8.

Art- 10:
Honestly, even if I found every single aspect of this show to be completely crap, I'd watch it just for the art- that's how good it is (looking at some other comments on the episode discussions and on other reviews, it does seem like there are people that feel this way anyways). Anyways, KyoAni always delivers, but even for them, this was one of their better works (possibly because of a higher budget from selling it to Netflix?). You can tell that a lot of detail was taken into drawing the characters (KyoAni should do more 19-20th century European style stuff) and the backgrounds were stunning as well.

Sound- 9:
I've heard some people say that the orchestral and piano background music gets a bit repetitive, but for me, the background OST never really got boring. For the most part, the OST fit the scenes perfectly, especially in the more dramatic scenes. The OP, Sincerely (which was sung by TRUE), was pretty good, but I did feel like it got a bit boring after the first few times I heard it. I felt like Minore Chihara's Michishibure, the ED, fit the anime a lot better. 

Character- 7:
I liked this show, so it's pretty hard for me to admit that the the ""character"" sub-category is one that could've been done a lot better. At first, Violet is quite the boring character, only knowing how to follow orders. Even to the end, I found it hard to relate to Violet, often finding that it was easier to relate to some of the side-characters, since Violet seemed to have little flaws, and just a personality which seems to be fake. The anime sure could've of done a better job of showing why Violet was the way she was earlier, and even in the episodes where we did get backstory of Violet's character, I felt that Violet's character could've been shown better. However, the anime adaptation does a great job of character development (which I've heard is one spot the light novel lacked at). The adaptation did show Violet learning how to write a letter, although it is strange that Violet went from being able to write a short sincere letters to being able to write long, beautiful ones. Again, Violet's interaction with others through working as a doll drives the anime again. Through this, Violet is able to grow as a person, and by interpreting other's thoughts and writing them as pure emotion, she learns emotions herself. She grows from a girl only able to obey orders to a girl that is able to fully express emotion and realize what love is. One key word you might notice is the last sentence: girl. Yes, Violet is only 14, yet is basically a superhuman ninja (to be fair it is marked as ""fantasy""). Because of these points, I consider a 7 for character a fairly reasonable score for VE.

Enjoyment- 9:
As I said earlier, VE was an anime that I looked forward it's release every single week. I found it entertaining, even through the more boring episodes. Yes, the spectacular Art and Sound do play a role in this, but I enjoyed seeing Violet being able to grow from episode to episode (whether it be a small growth or an big growth), despite not being able to fully relate to her as a character. I particularly enjoyed the latter half of the series, seeing bonds between lovers, parents and children, etc. grow. Even though there are plotholes, particularly in the character area, I have to admit that I started tearing up ep 9 and 10. I believe that, coupled with breathtaking animation and sound, Violet's growth by writing heartwarming letters that told wonderful and emotional stories brought us truly special, something to be cherished for the years coming.

Overall~ 8.6

Note: I haven't read the LN, but I have heard that the LN excludes Violet learning how to write letters, but does include more backstory. 
Another Note: This is my first review on this site, so I'll gladly welcome any feedback."

This is maybe the best anime series I've ever seen so far in a artisctic way, the story, characters, art, sound and the feelings... everything is perfect, I'm the type that usually finds a lot of flaws in various anime, but I couldn't find one in this anime, it was just perfect

When I was watching this anime, I felt like I was watching really high budget movie, or I was reading a book by a really good writer.

Also, good to mention that
                  ...
this anime is more a western type then a japan type for me, it doesn't have too much japan culture in it at all and feelings, interactions etc. were more western, but I like that 


So, let's go to the review:

First episodes starts pretty slow, but it is just right for you to meet and learn about characters, it gives you a introduction about every character and you will know all of them without a confusion.

Story 9/10 ---> Story is really good, you can read it in ""Synopsis"". Every episode has its plot and every plot is amazing and has a meaning behind it, the plot were pretty dark, that was the reason I was crying every episode like I mentioned before. I've watched only 10 episodes so far, so this is not final score. I'll edit it when I will complete the series.

Art 10/10 ---> This is best art I've ever seen in Anime TV series... really. It is so stunning!!! And watching it in 1080p is just heaven!

Sound 10/10 ---> Again... best soundtrack ever in anime!! It's different soundtrack from other anime, but it just fit the art in this enviroment of this anime so much!!! So stunning. Sound made the feelings of the anime to the TOP!

Characters 9/10 ---> Every character in this anime has its importancy in anime, every character is a bit different and they act really logical. Also, in every episode, I got introduced to a new characters, and they are made really well!

Story [9/10]
Violet Evergarden tells a beautiful story of a girl who has only known war, and from that has become an emotionless shell. After the war ends, she has to find a way to live in the real world. She ends up with a job where she is forced to understand the emotions of others, inspiring her to learn more about what it means to feel emotions.
When told that, you would not expect this show to be told with a mainly episodic narrative. But, after watching the show, you‚Äôll understand that trying to tell this story any other way would have been wrong. Doing this allowed the show to develop the main character, Violet Evergarden, through her experiences while giving interesting and especially touching new stories every single episode. This also gives episodes focused on the main character much more impact, as it shows that what‚Äôs happening in these episodes holds enough weight to take a break from the usual. The balance between one-off episodes and story-driven episodes is also perfect, giving the anime a steady, calming pace that brings the whole show together.
If you‚Äôre someone like me who cares a lot about the ending, this show is nothing to worry about. The ending turned out a perfect ending for this anime, an incredibly satisfying ending to an incredibly satisfying anime.

Art [10/10]
If you know one thing about Violet Evergarden, it‚Äôs that its visuals are beautiful. And that‚Äôs not an understatement--this anime is downright gorgeous. Every moment in this anime is beautifully made, there‚Äôs not a single moment at which the animation could be criticized. Although the beautiful landscapes and beautifully designed lighting and composition are not to be unappreciated, something that stood out to me greatly was the character design. Each character was designed incredibly well to match their personality and role, each design being diverse and visually beautiful. Another great aspect is the use of lighting: every single scene had lighting just where it needed to be, making each moment hit just that much harder, and setting the mood better than any dialog could. If choosing for the absolute best part of this anime, art definitely does take the cake.

Sound [9/10]
Although outshined by other aspects of this show in my opinion, the audio for this show is still definitely satisfying and fitting. The choice of voice actors was incredibly well done, not one voice felt out-of-place or uncomfortable. When it comes to music, the soundtrack is astonishing, pushing the emotions in the anime that much further. Listening back to the OST after watching this anime left me amazed, and I had to come back and bump up my score from an 8 to a 9 after doing so. Along with the background music, the ED really stuck with me, mostly due to its well placed use in the show. My only complaint is that the music isn't terribly remarkable. Although the music is beautiful and fits gorgeously in the show, I would not be able to point out that a specific song was from the Violet soundtrack if I was not told previously. This hinders me a little, but I still love the soundtrack and would recommend listening to the it if you need a little more push to watch this show.

Character [10/10]
One of my absolute favorite parts of this anime is that almost no character is left undeveloped, with the highlight of development being the main character, Violet. Seriously, this anime does character development remarkably well. Every character seems to just fit right into the anime, each serving a purpose to the show. No characters felt like unnecessary side characters or like plot-devices, rather each character felt like a new personality, each one having some development throughout the series. This is so well done due to the story being told episodically, which allows for each episode to focus on one character and therefore develop the character thoroughly and easily. Yet even with the show focusing on one character per episode, the show manages to develop Violet splendidly, showing her development incredibly well throughout the series. The perfect intricacy and distinctiveness of each character contributed greatly to my enjoyment of this series.


Enjoyment [9/10]
Overall, this show is definitely worth a shot. It may take a little bit before the show gets great, but, the waiting is entirely worth it. My only faults with this show are that the beginning mispaints the show, and that there is a decision that I thought was quite problematic (in episode 5). Despite that, though, I could not get myself to rate this show lower than a 9/10, because I just love it so much. It‚Äôs an incredible, touching, inspiring story that I wouldn‚Äôt skip over, one that's incredibly worth waiting through a less eventful first few episodes.

Overall: 9/10
Inspiring, touching, heartfelt, beautiful."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Violet Evergarden is one of the most well know animes ever released, and for a good reason. While watching you will feel many emotions, and unlike Violet you will understand them (probably). You will feel hapiness, sadness, despair for the characters and you are even most likely to cry or at least I did for the first and second watching. This is one of the most beautiful TV series in story and art.

//Story//
We are introduced to Violet Evergarden who is an ex-war veteran who grew up in military, thus because of that she has never learned to understand emotions. She meets Major Gilber who took
                  ...
her in and showed her ways in military and life. After war she becomes an Auto Memory Doll whose purpose is to write letters by customers request. She becomes one, because she wants to learn what those last words, that Gilber left her with, meant. While we follow Violet, she helps as an Auto Memory Doll many people, whose lives change, because of her. She helps them change and overcome their problems and hardships. For me personally I think every mini story is very good and every character we are introduced to, are very easily likable, even if not at first sight.

//Characters//
I have mentioned earlier that every character is very likable and what I meant with that is when you are introduced to a new character you many find them at first annoying, not very interesting, but as the episode goes on you will find out what got them in to the state they are in, you discover their problems with Violet. 

When Violet wakes up from sleep, after the final battle the first person she sees is Hodgins Claudia who also was a close friend of Gilber. He at first might seem little weird and not prepared to take care of her, but you will start to see, as the story progresses that he starts to be very protective of her, wants what is best for her and he was the one who let her become Auto Memory Doll and did he make a good decison.

As for the main protagonist aka Violet, she is one of my favorite characters ever. It may do with that I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt understand emotions well so I easily understood her problems. It is a true joy to see her go from person who well you probably can‚Äôt even call a person, doll may be even the right word, to become very inteligent, well mannered lady and finally see her understand what emotions mean.

//Animation/art// 
Violet Evergarden is indisputably one of the best looking shows you will find in this industry, by visuals, animation and charcater desing. Every sceen, every movement, every emotion is the meaning of beauty. If someone disagrees on me with this, I don‚Äôt belive they have eyes
What I also appreciate a lot is how colorful this anime looks, you have a story where people suffer by what have the war took from them, yet this colorful world somehow makes it even more heart warming

//Synopsis// 
In my opinion Violet Evergarden is one of the most beautiful shows ever released with its story and art/animation. If I had to recommend someone new to the anime genre, I would probably recommend exactly Violet Evergarden, because I truly belive that even many people who don‚Äôt watch anime normally would enjoy this show very much and would leave with their hearts touched.

10/10 True masterpiece"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"What does 'I love you' really mean?  It's a question that the show takes 13 episodes to explore, and even then - I doubt any one viewer finished the series with the same answer.  'Love' is such an abstract concept; that if you ever have to sit down and explain it to someone, you find yourself struggling to find the words.  It's easy enough to say that we love our pets, our friends, our parents and our lovers but when we have to pinpoint exactly what we mean by it, 'love' becomes something complex.

Visually, the show is very good throughout - with
                  ...
the animation having it's share of outstanding moments.  It's true that it can feel episodic at times, but I would argue that the episodic nature of the show is part of it's brilliance.  To understand love, Violet must see love in all it's different forms; siblings, friends, parents and children alike - because 'love' is so versatile that to personally define it you must have a wealth of experience.  Also, unlike other shows which have this structure; the episodes are not isolated and must be watched together to be understood.  We see Violet grow and develop as she learns more about the human condition and the true heart, and I think each self-contained story does a brilliant job of presenting, expanding, exploring and resolving itself.

What I will say in favour of why this show was a slight disappointment (mind you, having never read the novel), is that the War background felt somewhat misplaced.  It explained Violet's nature, certainly, but it also led to a lot of confusion and overall distraction from the plot.  There were so many unanswered questions regarding Violet's past and how she had been weaponised which left more confusion than anything else.  Then again, I do think the war was a brilliant mode to present sacrifice; both the most selfish and selfless form of love.

On the music front; I found the whole score unique and moving - though I do feel there was room for the orchestration to build even more during the climax of the show (maybe I just didn't have my volume loud enough!). Overall, it never felt obtrusive and complimented the story perfectly.  I believed Leiden was a real place on account of these details.

The language, too, contributed to the world building.  I appreciated that they came up with a unique language for the show, and although Leiden itself was reminiscent of 19th century Paris or Gilded Age America, I found the setting to be special in it's own way, which helped to create the individuality of Violet's world.

I think as a complete watch, it's very rewarding, and there is not much that I would change about it other than the obvious.  I definitely recommend it, and to be honest, I'd even go so far as to say it's a 'MUST WATCH' (which is high praise coming from me!!)"

                                      (4/13 eps)","Violet Evergarden (the series) is unlike any anime I've watched so far in that it aspires to be something other than entertainment. Rather than being pulp entertainment aimed at teenagers, it aspires to be Art. It aspires to be high literature. And as such it has to be judged by a different standard than you would apply to a Gintama or a Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. 

The series is nothing less than an artistic examination of what it means to be human. Sometimes it succeeds. Sometimes the series is a bit ham-handed in its attempts. It is an attempt worth watching. It is one of
                  ...
about four series that I go out of my way to catch every episode.

It conducts its examination through the eyes of the title character. Part of the confusion comes from the nature of Violet (the character) who is somewhere on the cyborg to full robot scale. She may be mostly human with a set of sophisticated prosthetic arms or she may be a robot. That she is relatively emotionless indicates she is further toward the fully robotic end of the scale. The technology that the character embodies is well wildly ahead with the mid 1800's - early 1900's Europe in which the story happens so it is possible that the character isn't even from the story's place and time. But that is irrelevant. What does matter is that Violet (the character) doesn't understand what it means to be human at all.  

The fictional character that most reminds me of Violet, is Data from Star Trek the Next Generation. Data and Violet both want to be human. Neither fully understands what that means. And the audience gets to explore what it means through the experiences of these two innocents.

This is not to say that it isn't entertaining. The humor stems from the ineptness of the character and the slightly warped view of society. There is enough eye-candy for anyone interested in that.

Where will it all go? Will Violet fall in love as she comes to better understand what it means? Will we see more of what she actually is and where she comes from? I look forward to finding out."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Plot and Story Line

If I were to explain Violet Evergarden in one sentence I would say that it is an emotional tale of a girl finding her purpose in life and peace withing her self. Still, one sentence is way to little to explain the depth of the story and actually demeaning considering the brilliance of this work.
Violet is firstly introduced to us lying in a hospital, heavily injured after her long battles in the Great War. For most of her life, Violet has only been a war-tool with one purpose only:

to kill the enemy. Now with the war coming to an end, the only
                  ...
remainder of her brutal past are her two mechanical hands. After a falling out with her new intended guardian family, Violet starts working at the CH Postal Service and soon enough decides to peruse a career as an ""Auto Memory Doll""-amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into letters. By doing that, Violet interacts with many different people and so learns more about her emotions and what they actually mean. 
I find it very hard right now to turn my thoughts on Violet Evergarden into words considering how much there actually is to it. The main story, with Violet in the center is an emotional tale of a war-torn personality who is trying to finally find peace from the anger and guilt haunting her. Finding it hard to forgive herself for what she has done in the past, Violet starts a journey that would teach her to live with her past and find new meaning in life. 

It is Violet's emotions and character development that are in focus of this extremely moving story. What is driving the story? Three words. ""I love you"" were the last words of Major Gilbert to Violet in their final battle and now Violet is trying to find out what those words actually mean. I did cry. A lot. But you know what's interesting? I cried in every single episode of this anime. It wasn't always a sad scene, the whole anime was just extremely moving. The side stories in this anime contribute to that as well. While writing letters for others, Violet gets to know so many people and drastically influences their lives without any intention to do so. 
The story of Violet Evergarden is in short a very emotional tale about forgiving yourself and learning to live with your past. It is, as I'd like to call it, a character-centered story. The plot on the whole might not be that interesting, and truth is that the story of Violet's and Major Gilbert's past is much more interesting, but the anime is trying to picture Violet's character development and puts a focus solely on her, without much happening in the story. But truth is, it gets pretty exciting from time to time, especially in the war flash backs and in the end of the anime. 

Characters
One thing that I keep repeating in this section of my reviews is the development of the main character and how it affects the story of the whole anime. Violet undergoes a tremendous character development and it is because of it that we get such a brilliant, intriguing and moving story. In the beginning she is that destroyed person, that only knows to live by orders and nothing else yet in the end turns into a person who is able to influence the lives of so many other characters in the anime. In my opinion, it is her simple character and straightforwardness that makes people realize what is actually important in life. Violet's character was broken and torn apart by the horror of war. But episode by episode, Violet tries to put those peaces together and eventually finds peace.
When it comes to other characters in the story, the side characters, it is Major Gilbert who of course has in my opinion the biggest influence. He is is the only thing that Violet holds dear and the only person who doesn't think of Violet as a war-tool. His words are those that keep Violet alive, literary. He is definitely, next to Violet my favorite character, because he showed greatness by loving and taking care of Violet despite her past. 

Animation and Style
Up until now, the anime which I consider had the best animation that I have ever seen was ufotable's Fate/ Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, but that has definitely changed after watching Violet Evergarden. As mentioned in the intro, just by seeing the teaser trailer like one ore even two years ago, I completely fell in love with this anime. The animation is magical, the style is gorgeous, the backgrounds are breathtaking and the character design is typically KyoAni. It has a bright and colorful scenery with a lot details. 
The animation was definitely the best thing about this anime and I will definitely watch it again some time just because of it. 

Conclusion
An intriguing and extremely moving story that portrays the struggle of a person with a war-torn personality trying to find peace and new meaning to her life. An amazing character development that makes you realize that the past should not defy who we are today. A breathtaking animation that you have hardly ever seen before. That is all Violet Evergarden and so much more at the same time. I wasn't actually planning on writing this review because I knew how hard it would be to describe a masterpiece like this one. In short, I cannot express how great the story of the Auto Memory Doll Violet Evergarden is. You just have to experience it on your own."

In an age where communication can take many different shapes and forms, some debatably more meaningful than others, I appreciate Violet Evergarden's heartfelt message on the importance and meaning of communication. If I could alter the opening quote for a modern setting I would say ""No conversation deserves to go unspoken"". 

Violet Evergarden is ultimately about the titular character evolving as a person. In the beginning Violet is quite dull and robotic, her arms not helping with that impression. This may put off many potential viewers, but I believe the reward of watching this show is being
                  ...
able to see Violet grow as a person, becoming more of a 'human' and reaching her goal of realizing the meaning behind the words ""I love you"". I think knowing beforehand that Violet will change dramatically is a better way to embrace the slow start of the series. 

Once Violet begins to go on jobs the series predominantly takes on an episodic format where we learn more about the world and the people within it. Much like Violet we as the audience are new to this world, so it is through her eyes that we experience it. As a letter writer, Violet not only meets people, she goes through their struggles as they try to convey their immense emotions on a small piece of paper. By living the life of an ordinary civilian and not a soldier Violet begins to sympathize with her clients, whereas previously she would have only accepted her 'orders' and left with no feelings towards her task. Despite their episodic nature these relationships Violet forms are not discarded and are called upon within her character defining moments as she struggles to move on with the loss of Major Gilbert.

Violet's immense struggle is aided by one of the most sensational soundtracks of all time. Each track blends in perfectly with the time period and evoke a myriad of emotions. The music is expertly used to create suspense, a sense of wonder, feelings of sadness and grief, and a sense of moving forward, not letting the past define you. Also aiding this is the impeccable animation, which offers incredibly subtle and realistic human movement and expression and creates a visually stunning and detailed world, packed with life which could have easily been very dull.

Violet's life as a soldier paints a moving war story that is lovingly handcrafted into a moving tale of growth, loss and the importance in being able to understand the feelings of others. I myself have had times where I am unable to say what I truly mean, and I've believed that my feelings could be expressed more truthfully in writing instead. For this, the series truly understands an important part of what it means to be human. Unlike other seasonal anime, Violet Evergarden has stuck with me and continues to do so. I take it's final message to heart and believe it encapsulates the wonder of the show.

""Live, live and live some more""."

Okay I was wrong. I was so damn WRONG! - Also me, 2019

My story of Violet Evergarden

This is one of those moments that can be described as a ‚Äòturn upside-down‚Äô situation for me. To be honest with you, I don‚Äôt like Violet Evergarden at the first place (at least after watching the first episode). My friend first introduced me by giving one of its trailer, and holy what a beautiful and exquisite animation. I think it was somewhere between 3 or 4 months before the series got aired, and I‚Äôm so mad hype
                  ...
about this ‚ÄòViolet Evergarden‚Äô thing. Back then I was clearly thinking that this anime, this whatever so-called typewriter anime, could win the best anime of the year. I got chills, the trailer made me had some incredible goosebumps. Looking back at what KyoAni has achieved in the past years, I certainly believe that Violet Evergarden could be the next CLANNAD.

After the first episode aired, I‚Äôm one of the first person amongst my -fellow anime watchers- friend to watch it. I gotta say, I'm terribly disappointed with it, to the part than I bashed this anime so hard by saying things like; ‚ÄúExcuse me wtf?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúKyoAni are you serious?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is the characterization?‚Äù. After sometime, few episodes have already available in the stream but I left this series unchecked, slowly forgotten by time. A good friend of mine confront me to give it another shot, he was convinced when he said ‚Äú Yeah, the series is getting better and better‚Äù (at that time, it was episode 5). I objected his argument by saying that ‚ÄúWatching this series is no more than a waste of time‚Äù. And so on, he never tried to convince me again. 

Since then, Violet Evergarden never came to my mind. I never heard spoilers of it, not even a single line from its delicious ‚Äòquotes‚Äô. It came to my mind after another friend of mine (from another group) was talking about anime, and he mentioned Violet Evergarden as one of his favourites. Reason? ‚ÄúTear jerking‚Äù, ‚ÄúSad‚Äù, and he ended up by saying, ‚ÄúJust watch the damn show and you will understand‚Äù. Stubbornly, I still quite convinced that he‚Äôs just one of those weak personality who just can‚Äôt deny melodrama bullsh*t that happens to air rapidly on the internet. 

It was 3 months after that, I was confronted again by another friend, and this time he‚Äôs damn sure I‚Äôm going to watch this Violet Evergarden sometime in the future. Nope, that didn‚Äôt happen. It was 2 months after that, I was convinced by another friend that just finished the series. He told me that the series was ‚ÄúFFS IT‚ÄôS SO GOOD‚Äù, so I finally decided to let go my ego and ‚Äòtry‚Äô not to be a dick on this series (although I am for like the past, what, 8 or 9 months?). I watched episode one again, still not interested but the feel of that ‚ÄòI‚Äôm disappointed‚Äô is long gone. I remember watching the first four episodes on day 1, and I gotta say I got goosebumps. Pretty okay series for me, but this time it got my curiosity hard. 

Day two, I proceed myself to watch episode 5, and what a lot of content did I miss. ‚ÄúHoly shit‚Äù. That‚Äôs what I said at the end of the episode. Say no more brother, I‚Äôm binging this to the end. And then, I watched it until episode 10, then I stopped. It‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt have time to finish it, but I‚Äôm tired.

Why am I tired? 

Let‚Äôs beat it. This series was so miserably, tearjerkingly sad, that I cried like almost every episodes after episode 5 and reach the climax of climax on the tenth episode. It is by far, the most beautiful and touching anime I‚Äôve ever watched (to this day, I‚Äôve watched more than 85 series). The combination of everything, the music, the art, the characterization (which I bashed earlier), the flow, the, like everything composed extremely exquisite to the point of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this series to end, but it has to end because my feelings can‚Äôt take it anymore‚Äù. I finished the rest of the series on the next day, and I‚Äôm well fed with warmth and glorious unexplained feelings. 

I gotta say, I have mistaken myself on the first place by saying that this series is a bullcrap, lazy anime for dragging mainstream audiences by using cheesy, melodramatic sequences. No, I love Violet Evergarden, every single part of it, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs flawless. It‚Äôs just I‚Äôm flattered and surprised by how good this anime is. I know that some people are saying Violet Evergarden as a whack overrated slice of life, but hey, people have their own opinions. For me, the experience was indescribable, I was immensely invested as the series unfolds chapters of chapters from a different kind of storytelling. In the end, it was a memorable show, one that will not ever be forgotten easily by time. 

I‚Äôm sorry Violet, it was a let down at first. Rest assured, because now I‚Äôve seen the truth of yours, masterfully painted on a dimension we entertained of.
I really wish an Auto Memoir Doll could write this review for me."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Welcome to another of Robert's Too Late Reviews! Only this time, we're not too late at all, really. I'm going to break with many of my fellow reviewers here and really thumbs up this anime for all I'm worth, and there's a reason for that. I am NOT coming from the viewpoint of a literary snob, critiquing the changes made from the novel or manga series. Being a literary snob in regards to American culture (do NOT get me started on Star Wars movies vs books) means I do understand where the criticism is coming from, and I don't take from it's value whatsoever. But
                  ...
coming in with 'virgin' eyes, I find a great deal to like, even love about this series. Will Violet make the RTLR wall or even shelves of greatness? Of note, we're as always doing dubbed. Let's do this thing.

Story: 9
I have read knocks not only on MAL, but also in other places too that say the story is unoriginal and lacking in inspiration. Well, let me tell you people, there is nothing new under the sun. That originality everyone seems to be chasing isn't original. Hell, take Game of Thrones, one of the biggest tv series around, good bit of it is based on history. For all intents and purposes, the story of a creature who wants to be more, or understand better can be dated at least back to 1883, with the invention of Pinocchio, if not even farther than that. Originality is nothing more than inspiration from sources you've not seen yet. Violet is a bit Pinocchio, a bit Spock, a bit Data, but yet still herself. To knock the story because it's derivative is juvenile in perspective. As a writer myself, I can promise you that your most cherished 'original' work borrows (or outright steals) from other works before it, only with a slightly new spin. That's how writing works. Don't mean all this vitriol at the beginning but to knock Violet's story is to take something away from the viewer, and Violet is a wonderful series overall.

The story is framed around Violet being presented as emotionless and desperately wanting to know what her Major meant when he said he loved her right before they were separated in a war tragedy. She takes a job as a scribe learning about feelings little by little until she reaches a point where it all makes sense. The problem with this setup is, almost immediately we see she does in fact know what love is. She loves the Major with all her heart, she just doesn't understand the words for the feelings she has. 

For a character presented as being fairly emotionless, she has a great deal of emotions, though she is very poorly equipped to handle them. She knows loneliness, she knows grief and pain, and she even comes to know regret and guilt. The true story is Violet coming to terms with feelings she's had. At the beginning of the show, her new caretaker, and the Major's commanding officer, tells her she is burning. The point of the show is her coming to realize he's right. That she burns for her past mistakes, she burns for her past losses, that she burns from regret, and that the war left her terribly scarred. 

Because she was a child soldier she was taught to suppress these feelings (we assume, this is never explicitly stated) and her life outside the war is coming to know what real life, and real feelings is all about. About how to handle feelings she was taught to ignore or not feel at all. She is like Pinocchio, in that she feels she's something different, and wants to know what love is, even though the answer's already inside of her. She is like Data and his quest to become human. And at times she's Spock, desperately trying to deny that side of herself. Watching Violet bloom into something more than a soldier, a weapon of war, a killer, is a thrill and a joy. Does she make it? Of course she does, it would be a shitty ending if she dressed in formal uniform and blew her own brains out. The happy ending is assumed. Like every other show where the happy ending is assumed, the joy comes not from the completion of the story, but the journey of getting there. Same hold true for Violet as she comes to understand people, and ultimately herself. 

Art: 10
The show is STUNNING. The production values are sky high, and looks every bit of it. The only complaint I have about the artwork is that some of the men are slightly similar looking. The main offenders to me are two brothers (makes sense) and the superior that takes Violet in. Every here and there, I kind of got them mixed up briefly. Otherwise, the show is just jaw dropping. This is a new high water mark in animation, as far as I'm concerned. 

Sound: 10
The background music was very fitting, rising and falling at appropriate times, and the themes are well done. The voice acting is top notch as well, Violet herself is beautifully cast, her voice perfectly matching not only the rather monotone parts where she's stiff, but also the cries of pain and suffering as she comes to understand her own feelings. The other scribe girls all sound great, the outgoing one sounding cheery, the quiet one sounding reserved, so forth. For me it's the voicing that really shone through and made this a 10 for me. 

Character: 9
My one big knock character-wise, there's a matronly figure that is very familiar with the superior of Violets that has most of her breasts hanging out basically all the time. Sure fanservice is what it is, but there was no need for it. She looks rather whorish to me compared to the rest of the cast. This goes especially against the grain of prim and proper Violet herself. Big breasted is fine, I have big breasted women in my family, and as a man am a fan of large ones as well, but for Christ's sake, cover them up, especially in the Victorian like setting!

There is also a quiet, somewhat troubled girl in the scribe department I wish I knew more about. She is covered some, but only in regards to Violet's character building. I know it was a short series, but I kinda wish I knew more about this quiet girl. The outgoing girl gets her own episode with Violet, wish quiet girl would have gotten the same level of development beyond the fact she's afraid she's no good at her job. 

Violet herself as I said is misrepresented by the summaries and media out there. She's not a creature without emotions seeking to learn them, ala Commander Data. She is full of emotion, but she has no background or basis to understand them with. It's almost immediately apparent she loves the Major with all her being, more than just relying on him because he's her commander. She just doesn't have the grounding to know what love truly is, and is confused by her own feelings. She's less ""What does love mean"" and more ""Is this feeling I have inside me love?"" Her love for the Major falls deeply into co-dependency because one she learns he is likely dead she struggles with desires to take her own life. She feels lost and unsure on how to proceed. When you find someone you cannot live without, that's love, my friends. 

Violet's journey of self discovery is fascinating in that she doesn't really know how to do it, and is guided along by friends and clients that teach her the truths of what she is really feeling. Often times she brings such powerful emotions to those teaching her that it's very moving. I admit I got misty eyed quite a few times over this series. 

Finally Violet faces a question we all do, and ones soldiers in particular must deal with: do we deserve forgiveness? Do we deserve to live after hurting others? Soldiers really struggle with this, how can they live a happy life knowing they took away the happy lives of their enemies? That they took away the happy lives of their enemies entire families? When does the blood on their hands become too much to wash off? This is why in the real world we have so many veterans lost in the bottle or suffering from serious mental illness such as PTSD, precisely because they are in Violet's shoes, wondering how to make up for the suffering they've caused. Wondering if they can ever make up for it. It gives the whole series a tragic, yet very real feeling. 

Enjoyment: 10
I love this anime because of the fact it's about emotions and dealing with them. I'm bipolar, severely enough to the point I'm disabled from it. I overflow with emotions all the time, many of them I don't have words for. Many of them that make me scream in pain. I have worn Violet's stoic mask. I am on fire too. Maybe not for the same reasons she is, but emotion can burn us all. Watching her come to understand who she is and realize what she is feeling really resonated well with me. Add to that beautiful animation and a solid voice cast, and you have one amazing show. I just hope someday I can openly admit I love myself as she did. 

I can't recommend this series more, again as a virgin viewer with no knowledge of the light novel/manga. Let me tell you, I agree the books are always better (with very few exceptions) so I get the disappointment some people have in the series. But without that foundation in the story, taking it for what it is, it is glorious and I could not recommend it more. As for the RTLR wall, of course she scores a spot, and I have her doll membership pen coming, gonna hang it on my curtain. Two thumbs way up!"

The art is fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen.

With the exception of Violet, although they haven't developed her much, the characters are mundane, predictable, and quite frankly boring stereotypes.

The dialogue and story are laughable, I literally laughed at how bad they are, it is on the verge of being ironic how bad the story is. It's one of those things that you might see on MST3K. It is beyond me how little they invested on the writing for this show.

Secretaries do more than these
                  ...
""Dolls"" their function is to write letters in a world where many (most?) are illiterate but have the technology to make robotic limbs. It is horrible, and the dialogue in such a slow paced character driven show is ridiculous, nobody has conversations that stupid.

Overall it is a laughably vacuous piece of predictable sappy asinine nonsense."

No one understands jack shit as kid, but what I REALLY didn't understand was why people got so emotional all the time. I was a very stoic child and I never really had any particular interests, I just sort of...existed for a while, not really coming into my own being until mid to late teens. Why did people cry all time over things that shouldn't matter?

Now, I'm a older person. I have likes, dislikes, goals, and ideas. It feels great to feel like you're doing something, instead of being
                  ...
an emotionless blob. It also feels great to be able to empathize with someone whom you have a fondness for, that feeling of similarity is very empowering.

This series' enjoyment for me is mostly based on the amount of empathy I carry for the main character Violet, I can relate to pretty much everything she goes through in her development as a person. She is fantastically written and her whole arc really hit home for me.

But now regardless of my obvious bias in favor of Violet's character, everything else is real good in my opinion. It doesn't need to be said that literally everything looks and sounds orgasmic, as for the story itself there isn't too much to say without spoiling anything. Its a drama, and if that's whats your looking for I would absolutely recommend it to you."

Letters, a piece of paper that serves a purpose more than just a paper. They contain more than just information but rather filled with feelings and emotions.

So I'll admit episode 1 and 2 weren't the most captivating but from episode 3 and up the story has been phenomenal, Violet Evergarden is a true gem among anime not only this year but all time, and here's why...
The art style is amazing and even surpasses the art style of most fully funded anime movies(Thank you Netflix) as well as a great animation style, but the most impressive would be it's use of lighting, I was blown away every time there was a sunset scene and the level of detail is also a very prominent strong point in the visual
                  ...
aspects...
The soundtrack was exhilarating, every time that violin started playing I would mimic the violinist(I'm a weirdo like that) as my ears were treated to a symphony of beautifully played instruments and sounds as well during the backstory on episode 8 and 9 I was thoroughly impressed by the soundscape and the surround sound as well as the accuracy of the sound of a WWI war zone...
The story and writing was simply put, Amazing, Kana Akatsuki did amazingly and Taichi Ishidate was a superb director and excellent screenplay by Reiko Yoshida, lets just say that my heart was beating at 120 during the first 5 minutes of episode 13 and I love how deeply each character is explored throughout the series and all their post-war stories as that's what this story was about, it was the different experiences of people who had endured the war in different ways and everyone loves a good war story. 
Oh I forgot to mention the landscapes... Holy s%!+... this really pushed boundaries I never thought you could make a fictional world so detailed and pretty, I got at least 20 wallpapers from the scenes in the anime based entirely on the landscape...
Wow sorry just wrote a full essay so...

Is it anime of the year material? yes
Are you still reading? Doubtful
But if you are and you haven't watched it GO AND WATCH IT!!!"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"""It's about the journey, not the destination.""

This phrase is used to describe a lot of shows, movies, etc. The basic idea is that how the story shakes out in the end isn't important: the experiences gained along the way are what matter.

Violet Evergarden is a tricky show to parse at first, because it's the antithesis of that idea. It relies on a slow build of character, story, and tone that might not grab you and sweep you away right off the bat. It demands the patience to sit down and follow it through to the end, trusting that the time you invest in it will
                  ...
pay off when all the pieces come together. Violet Evergarden is ALL about the destination. And I understand how this might put some people off it, as you don't know whether the 6.5 precious hours you spend watching it will be worth it, or just a waste of time.

Well, fear not, curious one. Because having finally finished the show, I can confirm that it is absolutely worth it.

Set in a fictional country that resembles Victorian England with a bit of a steampunk twist, Violet Evergarden centers around its titular hero, a 14-year old orphan girl who was taken in by the army and raised as a living weapon, a tool of death meant only to be used, pointed at the next target and told to kill. But the war is over now. There's no more fighting left to do. Major Gilbert, the one man who treated Violet as anything more than a tool, is missing, presumed dead. So where does she go from here?

Well, she finds a job at the Auto Memories Doll service, a ghostwriting service that sends its ""dolls"" across the country to write letters for whomever asks for them. Why does she take this job? Because she's haunted by the last words the Major spoke to her: three words that, having been raised as an emotionless killing machine, she can't understand. By transcribing the thoughts and feelings of others onto paper, she hopes that one day, she will grow enough to understand Gilbert's last message to her.

The series follows a mostly episodic format, in which Violet is called out to write for a new client every week. As expected, they all have tragic backstories or deep-seated issues, and through her interactions with them and their emotions, Violet begins her slow crawl back to humanity. Her growth serves as the throughline tying these mostly unrelated stories together, with each inch of progress she makes during one episode visible in the next. This is what I mean by the destination mattering more than the journey; on their own, these disparate stories about wounded people trying to find peace might not be all that interesting. It's only when taken as a whole- not as separate vignettes, but as one character's deeply personal journey, exploring love in all its facets and flaws- that the show begins to truly pay off.

And holy SHIT, does it pay off. The waterworks may be slow to come, but once they start flowing, they don't stop. Violet's increasing awareness of her own humanity, and the pain she both feels and has caused, is utterly wrenching, and in the moments where it fully bursts out, it makes me sob more consistently than anything since Clannad After Story. Credit must be given to the criminally underrated Yui Ishikawa, who between this and Mikasa Ackerman has nailed the seemingly-emotionless-but-with-hidden-depths shtick down to a science. Yes, it may be slightly melodramatic at times, but this is anime. If I'm not watching it for huge swells of feeling and emotion, then why am I watching it at all?

What helps these moments land is the fact that anime though it may be, Violet Evergarden doesn't feel like anything else on the market right now. I mean, in a medium full of giant mechas, high school, fanservice, video game worlds, and other intensely nerdy pursuits, Violet Evergarden feels like it was ripped right out of the pages of a Jane Austen novel. It's soaked in a kind of 19th-century atmosphere and feeling, defiantly refusing to pursue any of the tropes we've come to expect from anime. That kind of attitude is admirable, and it helps the series' biggest moments land with the impact that they do.

Of course, special attention must be paid to the animation as well. Kyoto Animation has always been the king of good-looking shows, but this one REALLY takes the cake. Beautiful backgrounds, characters that move and shift with subtle detail, well-integrated cg, cinematic-quality editing and lighting effects, and some truly jaw-dropping rotoscoping... you could print out every single frame of this show and hang it on your wall. It adds so much wonder and beauty to a show that's all about wonder and beauty, making for a truly enthralling watch.

All in all, Violet Evergarden is a true masterpiece, worthy of the hype that it's been gestating in for the past few months. If you abandoned it early on because you were worried it wasn't going anywhere, now would be the time to fix that. Because it does, indeed, go somewhere, and the destination is absolutely worth the journey."

                                      (14/13 eps)","Story: 
This anime is about a young girl (named Violet Evergarden) who was used as a tool of war. She was far more like a machine or an animal than a human girl. The anime starts with the war being over and a man taking her in. She joins his company and becomes a letter typer to learn what ""I love you"" means. Over the course of anime, she slowly learns how to be human, and realizes all the wrongs she's done in the past.

Art:
The art style is vibrant and full of color, borderlines are thin and the backgrounds are wonderfully drawn.

Sounds:
From cannon fire to
                  ...
the sound of Violet crying are expertly done in the Dub and Sub(in fact I think the dub is better)When it's raining and when bullets are flying the sounds can really immerse you into the world.

Character:
Violet - She is introduced in the beginning as an injured war survivor. However; you quickly learn she is no hero. In fact, she's more like a weapon. During the war, she couldn't talk or even think for herself. She was like a Dog to her leader and a crazy dangerous monster to their enemies. When she gets a job as an Auto-memories doll she slowly learns more about her past and how to be human and not a weapon.

Enjoyment:
Most episodes deal with her as she types up letters with people and learns about their past and their feelings of love and loss. Most episodes can be tearjerkers. Watching Violet evolve is a wonderful thing and all the bumps along the way can be heartbreaking.

Overall:
Outstanding anime that could easily become an instant classic. There doesn't seem to be any real negatives when I think of this anime. Violet Evergarden is a must-watch."

This anime I will say that all the stories

The stories of this anime is a 10/10 for sure. This is how the stories are for me.
It felt like a thorn stab right through your heart countless time. When you try to get up you then know that its useless cause in front of y- No, in every corner you can see a burning arrow fill with sadness falling right at you from a very far distant. Hopelessly struggle as you try to avoid those arrow. Some of them hit you and gave you the pain that you mightn't be
                  ...
able to run at all. Some of them miss you but nonetheless a lot of arrows already stab right to your body countless of times and then you met your end...
The stories have a strong point on how it can let people felt the emotion and imagine them. It let you predicted it just a little while that prediction made them cry even harder. Even if you close your eye you can still felt how much emotion in it. Not just that along with that sadness you will feel. The characters developing are also made you smile. Sometimes made you cry with joy.

For the art, I will say that all the art are perfectly fit how the stories need to be. It gave you the right image that you felt while listen or read the subtitle along the way. Help to support the stories even more. That's just how good it was. With the Opening and Ending art style that also goes so well with the stories as well. I recommend you check the OP/ED. 10/10 for sure.

As for the characters, I will say that every character is very loveable and enjoyable characters as well. They supporting to how this anime needs to be like ""Teaching Violet's emotion""
The more I watch it, the more see how Violet's character is.

As for how much I enjoying it? Oh, its obvious to how I wrote something like this. A 100% SURE IS A 10/10 RATE!

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Through this show, I have been inspired to leave my very first review on this site. I don't even care if anyone reads it, but I simply wish to express my thoughts on the show in a way that will hopefully convince someone to embark on the same wonderful experience that the show has brought me on.

And so, we begin.

It is very possible to place VE under a magnifying glass and spend endless hours scrutinising its faults. Many jaded critics will definitely do so and correctly pinpoint the misgivings of the series. However, I am of the opinion that while Violet Evergarden delivers a simple,
                  ...
relatively predictable story, it does so in a way that nonetheless hits like an emotional truck and succeeds in taking the viewer through a journey that truly elevates the standard of an emotional, feel-good anime.

The opening warmed my heart in a way I cannot describe. Soft ambient lighting and breathtaking sceneries combine with beautifully orchestrated music to deliver a sledgehammer of a first-impression, conveying peace, tranquility and a hopeful feeling of better days to come, with an ominous undertone of melancholy in a post-war world where too much has been lost by too many.

It might take a little bit for some viewers to look the other way on some logic holes, such as how Violet was an effective member of the military as a young child and why she was even there in the first place, but the story starts her off in an acceptable place: a recovering, socially-inept war orphan and veteran who has known nothing but battle, to start a new life in the aftermath of the war, with feelings of dissociation, shell-shock and loss of identity. Through her foray into the normalities of civilian life, she struggles to part with her military habits and is exposed to the faults of her cold, compassionless predisposition. Seeking a deeper understanding of all the emotions that escape her, the motivation behind taking the job as a transcriber is well-set and logical, and thus she is set loose on a path to explore the human condition through the experiences of her clients, who trust her with putting their emotions from speech to paper in a series of attempts to resolve their most personal struggles.

Simple and relatable tales of love lost, unlikely romance, ambitions abandoned and finding hope in the face of complete despair are explored through Violet's ""born-yesterday"" lens as she slowly comes to terms with her own wounds and realises that she, too, is every bit as human as the people she is writing for. With the experience of each passing client, we get to see Violet evolve into a more empathetic young lady who gradually connects with all the feelings that she was tragically deprived of as a child. Each story explores a different theme and introduces a relatable struggle that is conveyed through great storytelling in a short and digestible format.

While each story will hit differently hard for various viewers, the single moment of the entire show that did it for me was hearing the quivering scream of a child trying to save what little remains of her time with her mother. Never before have I felt an anime convey such a raw, unfiltered sense of desperation in a manner which hits far too close to home. The orchestration of stellar voice acting, appropriate visuals and emotional investment into the characters had me ready to explode into a wave of tears when the inevitable climax of every episode arrives. None of these tales are particularly complex or spectacular in their own right, but it is the simple combination of a lot of little things done well that allow even the simplest tales to deliver the hardest emotional punches.

Every story succeeds in bringing forth the familiar magical feeling of a heart-warming children's tale that moves the viewer to tears. Violet Evergarden took me through a roller-coaster in what I can only describe as the pinnacle of emotional anime. Whether it is self-reflection, gratefulness, sorrow or regret, the show delicately tugs the heartstrings of its audience and forces the introspection of long-repressed emotions which escape the body in an unstoppable cascade of tears and self-acceptance. While the plot might sometimes be shallow and the music slightly overbearing at times, I cannot help but overlook these faults and strongly recommend the show as a must-watch experience that will leave the viewer hungry for more."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"In short: a MUST watch, I'm not recommending it, I'm saying you HAVE to give it a shot. Breathtaking art, a story packed full of feels, and main character development that really makes you tear up. One word to describe this anime is ""beautiful""

The first thing that I noticed was the stunning art style. Highly detailed and beautifully colored, it definitely has one of the best art. Some scenes are so well made that it really makes you go, ""woah""

The story is mostly one episode arcs with only Violet tying them all together. The anime is mainly about Violet's encounters and how they change her.
                  ...
She starts off as emotionless, but she starts to develop emotions as she experiences things that melt the ice around her heart. 

Each episode is packed full of feels that build up to a heartwarming, tear-jerking finale.

Again this anime is a must watch. At worst if you don't like it, you can drop it, but if people miss out on this anime, they might miss out on something so beautiful and heartwarming that they might really enjoy."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"God, what a beautiful anime. I watched Violet Evergarden with my best friend, who gave this anime very high praise. All I knew before I started watching this, was that it was made by Kyoto Animation, and that it was going to be a more sad, or emotional anime.

The story is complex and interesting. The story's main focus is on the main character herself: Violet Evergarden, and her travels all over the world; writing letters for those who can't write, or can't find the right words.

The art and animation are some of the best things about Violet Evergarden. I could praise it all day if
                  ...
I wanted to. Violet Evergarden probably has the best animation of any anime I've ever seen. There are so many scenes that I want to mention, but it would be spoilers.

The characters, their characterization, and their growth are very well done. Throughout the story, we learn about Violet's backstory about being in the army as a child, and how the aftereffects of that are catching up to her in the present. We learn why she's so hellbent on trying to learn what the words ""the person she held dearest"" said to her meant. The characters are not 2-Dimensional as they show an incredible amount of growth too. We see Violet from the very first episode where she still acts like a soldier awaiting orders, to throughout the anime where she's always learning more about herself, ""the person she held dearest"", the world, you name it. Violet, as well as the rest of the characters are well written, and ever-changing.

Overall, I gave Violet Evergarden a 10 because I loved almost every minute of it. I teared up during many episodes, and I'm not the type to cry a lot. This is my first ever anime review, so I hope it makes sense."

In all honesty when I started watching this series thought it was pretty mediocre (at best). Fuelled by its popularity and high ratings I kept watching even though I was about to drop it. I am glad I kept watching. 
Since, I do not want to spoil things I will keep my comments abstract. Around half way things become more and interesting, personal perhaps and episode 11 even left me heart struck.

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I really had no expectations when starting Violet Evergarden. I simply caved one day because I felt Netflix was constantly pushing this show on me & the art looked beautiful. & boy do I not regret giving this show a chance. 

Violet Evergarden is a young, orphan girl who had been trained to be a soldier in the war, but the war is over now & it’ time for her to try to live a regular life. However, Violet was not raised like regular children and is definitely lacking in social skills. She becomes an “Auto Memory Doll” ( someone who writes letters for others,
                  ...
trying to put their thoughts and emotions into words ) in an effort to understand some of the last words her beloved Major told her at the end of the war - “I love you”.

For someone so unaware of social queues & unfamiliar with experiencing a variety of emotions herself, Violet ends up touching the lives of many people she interacts with as a Doll. I find her encounters with people to be touching and sweet as Violet tries to understand their emotions. While she may appear to struggle at first with reading others, Violet is able to help others understand how they feel far better than they ever could have on their own. 

Watching Violet’s journey & her flashbacks with the Major, it seems clear to me that she greatly cared for him and loved him as well. She just didn’t understand that yet, or how her participation in the war has impacted her. Each person she met along the way ended up helping her get one step closer to realizing that fact, and thus ended up helping her just as she helped them. Even though we only see the Major in flashbacks, I loved watching how he cared for Violet & these scenes only make it more obvious for why she feels so strongly about this man. 

Most of us have seen plenty of anime where great battles or wars take place, but they don’t always venture into what happens to those who participated after the fighting has ceased. Violet Evergarden doesn’t focus on the action, but rather the feelings and stories of those who have survived on after the war. It’s a beautiful series, and I loved each and every episode. Heck, some even got me to cry. If you’re looking for something focusing on human emotions & relationships rather than the fighting and crazy powers anime characters tend to have, Violet Evergarden may be up your alley."

Before continuing, know that I will do my best to not spoil anything but do be warned of the possibility.(I don't think I spoiled anything)  

I will not spend time debating the visuals or soundtrack as they are both excellent which is to be expected since KyoAni has been only getting better over the years. 

No, what I really want
                  ...
to talk about is Violet. Bland old Violet who might have well been replaced with a piece of paper for all the difference that would make, said past me. Oh, my darling I was so very wrong. 

Violet is actually a fantastic character. Yes, she is blank and frankly boring and since she is the MC that colours our vision of the whole show, and that's only natural. However, her bland personality is KEY for those first few episodes. 

Yes I can hear everyone else say that a story and by extension its MC should be able to grip you from the very beginning and to a large extent I agree. HOWEVER, I am willing to look past it in the case of Violet because it is this blandness which makes latter moments stand out so much more. Her slow journey towards realising that she's not just a bland doll-soldier. Her realisation, and subsequently our own, that she is HUMAN. Violet is brimming with emotions she was incapable of understanding and which she had suppressed for so long. 

This is a ChaRacter driven show, it is a slow building show and so far it has demonstrated that the people behind it are great storytellers. They know when to deliver scenes, they know when to delay them. And I will highly recommend people to be patient with it, this show is well worth your time."

                                      (8/13 eps)","This review was ,made after watching 8 of the 14 episodes.

I never understood how people could enjoy episodic anime, where each episode featured different people, unrelated to the previous or upcoming episode. Anime like Cowboy Bebop, or Samurai Champloo I never really enjoyed due to them having the basic timeline of episode 1: introduce characters, episode 2-24: random adventures that feature ""character development."" and finally the last 2 episodes having an actual backstory to them. It was boring, I didnt like it and I thought the character development was garbage. HOWEVER, Violet Evergarden is the perfection of this.

Story: 9/10
The story is somewhat basic but very
                  ...
solid, a girl raised as a killing machine has lost the only person that was important to her and now she lives her life as a normal human. Each episode focuses mostly on the characters more than it does the story. Violet Evergarden's biggest perks are in the Character and Art sections so go read those. The story's main focus is Violet's character development and how she changes emotionally.

Art: 10/10
Violet Evergarden in my opinion is the best looking anime to ever come out, period. Better than any anime movie, better than Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Budget Works, better than anything else by Kyoto. This is flat out the most beautiful anime I have ever watched. Even minor details like a flower moving or wind blowing, each motion is unique and not a repeated set of frames unlike nearly any other anime. The beautiful art style helps in conveying emotions and the mood of the scene, you wont understand unless you watch it, a good example of this is when her shoe is going through the water in episode 7, it was an extremely emotional moment and the beautiful animation just amplifies it. I can not give this anime enough praise on the animation and art.

Sound: 10/10
Just like the art, the OST perfectly sets the tone for a powerful emotional scene, or sometimes there will be no music which sets this unsettling type of mood, in conjunction with the art, it works out perfectly. Both the opening and the ending are beautiful songs that fit in perfectly for where they are in the show, the opening gets you excited for the new episode and the ending is a slow piano song which is almost emotional, fitting in perfectly since nearly every episode ends on some emotional scene between the characters.

Character: 10/10
The biggest focus in Violet Evergarden is Violet's transition of being a heartless soldier that doesn't understand emotions, to her first smile, to her first tears, to her understanding of the darkness she has caused by killing so many people who had loved ones. The ""burning"" scene that was at the end of episode 7 had a huge impact and helped convey how she has changed from episode 1 to episode 7 (Ive mentioned ep7 twice now because it was just such a fantastic episode). The only issue I can find in Violet Evergarden's character department is that the side characters (basically everyone except Violet) don't seem to have that much depth to them as most of the screen time is spent on Violet herself. Basically, Violet gets A LOT of screen time while pretty much any other recurring character takes a back seat.

Enjoyment: 10/10
Typically I am more so the type that enjoys your generic magic/action/bits of comedy and romance type of anime. But Violet Evergarden's writing is just absolutely phenomenal. Every episode is an adventure, either with new characters or current ones. No other episodic anime holds a candle to Violet Evergarden, I have never watched an episodic anime that I absolutely loved until Violet Evergarden came around. Keep in mind not every episode features different characters, episode 8 for example focused on the previous events between Violet and the Major.

Overall: 10/10.
Violet Evergarden displays the best art style and animation you will ever see in any anime, a perfectly fitting OST, various heavily emotional scenes and fantastic character development. Can you really ask for more?"
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I have only one word: ""Beautiful"".

From story, art, animation, execution, it was all done beautifully. 

Story line was written with settings of a post war nation, which suffered great lost from the war it just went through. Of course, the grim dark truth of war is still around and peace is not going to be easy to keep while people always yearn for it. However, even this part was made beautifully too, as everyone who can do anything to make sure another war won't break out will try to whatever they can, even if it seems like they'd be useless in the situation. 

And then,
                  ...
the dedication of the characters to what they believe was also done beautifully. Almost too extreme for some, but nevertheless, such understanding and dedication can really make the real world a peaceful one, even if it seems apparent. 

Not just that, the story also led me to so many surprises, it's actually enjoyable not being able to guess what's going to happen, even if I prone to just guess what might happen.

Even characters too, was portrayed beautifully. I can say for one thing: There was no bad character, no antagonist, or even a bad concept in this series. Even war, death, was portrayed so beautifully. No, not the glory war or death, but because of the dedication from all characters I mentioned above, both of these concepts became something beautiful. War is what let people know how bad it is, that's why they want peace. Death causes pain, but it teaches people to cherish life, still there or have gone already.

For art and sound, you will be overwhelmed right away, in the first episode so I won't mention much about them. Let's just say, it all sums up in one word: ""Beautiful"". 

Personally, I recommend this series to anyone who can afford to watch it. 
I noticed I use the word beautiful too much in this review. However, I haven't seen something of this extend in a long time. And I have also mentioned it can all be summed it that one word, so please bear with me in that aspect."

Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Mixed Feelings,"At its core, Violet Evergarden is about the silver linings of loss. The story centers around Violet, an emotionally stunted war veteran finding her place in a peacetime society, working at a job that requires interacting with clients on a personal level; learning to know herself as she learns and explores emotional–and often tragic–experiences of others. We follow her as she grows as a person, eventually realizing and coming to terms with the toxic past she was forced upon, and seeking redemption for a brighter future... An interesting concept with execution that leaves to be desired. This show tries to implement too many things, but
                  ...
falls short in some regards. The worldbuilding is sloppy at best; and some plot elements just don't seem to fit the mood of the anime other than for superficial reasons, ultimately feeling unnecessary.

The 'strongest' aspect of the show, aside from the stunning visuals, is the characterization. Competently developed through both showing and telling, Violet is very literal, blunt and surprisingly perceptive depending on the context. She was used as a weapon her entire life and thus thinks of herself as one, she believes her value as a person is entirely dependent on her usefulness as a tool of war. At first, she is oblivious to her own shortcomings and flaws–mainly her lack of touch and common sense–causing problems for herself and those around her, but it is this dynamic that lets people see their own contradictory nature and allows Violet to peel out their façade. Violet eventually develops her own sense of empathy, not by putting herself in other people's shoes, but vice versa. Projecting her own experiences and point of view onto other people in order to better understand the situation.

Sadly, there are several missteps when it comes to a few major characters and how they are presented, more specifically with Gilbert. 'The Major' is a very shallow and two dimensional character, we don't get to know a whole lot about him other than he cared and fell in love with Violet, all while being remorseful for using her as a weapon. His lack of development makes their relationship feel somewhat contrived. Honestly, he's more of a plot device, a catalyst for Violet's development. This would be OK if not for the fact that a big chunk of the show is spent trying to sell us their connection. Other major characters include Hodgins, Benedict, Cattleya, Erica, Luculia, and Iris. Some of these are fairly fleshed out considering the limited airtime they got; with their own history, internal conflicts and personal goals, but that end up being underused due to the episodic nature of the show.

I also have some clear-cut complaints about several pieces of dialogue, nonsensical character actions, and even a couple of plot holes, but that would be getting into spoiler territory.

One of the weakest points of this series has to be the worldbuilding, which was left mostly unexplored aside from some surface-level expositions about the previous war, some anti-peace group with cookie cutter motives, and the several countries Violet visits. There are plot elements that leave you with a petulant feeling of inconsistency: Technological marvels like robotic prosthetic limbs or speech-to-text machines that are beyond even our level of technology, all while the rest of this fictional world is stuck in a Belle Époque-esque time period, including weaponry and transportation. Violet's inhuman abilities make very little sense, and seem to be created solely to provide an impetus for more captivating action sequences, a task that in my opinion failed miserably, as the choreography, editing and overall mechanics of the action are overdone to the point of being ridiculous.

The art and animation is some of the greatest I've seen for a TV anime, but most importantly, they serve a narrative purpose, be it by subtle symbolism that is easy to miss, or setting a visual theme. An adept use of cinematography and mise-en-scène to visually reinforce a certain state of mind or a specific theme, like conflicting ideas in upside down reflections, a room visually pushing down on a character feeling remorse, or the frame of a chair's backrest trapping someone as she questions her own abilities as an Auto Memoir Doll. The character linework is also very sharp and clean. My only nitpick is that the layouts tend to be somewhat safe, very much made-for-TV kind of deal, which is understandable.

In short, Violet Evergarden reaches a bit too high for its own good, but still manages to provide a decent, albeit flawed experience."
Violet_Evergarden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,RecommendedSpoiler,"Violet Evergarden is one of the greatest pieces of fiction I've had a chance to watch, and I've never been so moved by a character as well written as Violet Evergaden is. This series follows the life of Violet as she looks to find completeness and the meaning to her life while attempting to reintegrate her self back into society after being used as a tool for war. Violet runs into socialization struggles as she returns home with no experience of life besides being a great combatant at war. Violet becomes fond of a certain line of work when she becomes familiar with the occupation
                  ...
of an ""Auto Memory Doll"", a service which involves delivery of hand-written letters that the Doll is required to convey & recite with full emotion to the recipient.

What makes this series so amazing is the ability for the audience to attach themselves to Violet as her lack of awareness & social queues can easily be relatable for the audience viewing. She connects with the Major's acquaintances who assist Violet by providing her a home and a community as she is a young orphan. Violet longs for her Major who is portrayed to have passed away at the end of the war (he & Violet were both gravely injured). The series takes place right after the war with Violet's arms being severed and replaced with metal prosthetic's. With the Major's final words to Violet Evergarden being ""I love you"", this series follows Violet's goal of developing her emotion and searching for the missing Major who left her with those vague words that echo in her heart, and this series shares multiple beautiful stories as Violet travels to different places to deliver her mail as an Auto Memory Doll while she tasks herself with searching for the meaning of loving another individual.

This series is highly recommended if you're craving an extremely emotional slice of life with breathtaking visuals by Kyoto Animation, the soundtracks (Openings, Endings, & OST's) perfectly compliment the anime and I would like to kindly suggest if you do decide on giving Violet Evergarden a chance, that you also follow-up with the movie as it is cannon material that wraps up the story with a beautiful sincere ending.

                  ...
learn how to write letters for clients who wish to send letters, at a time where mail is the main source of communication. At the chance of living a normal life and adapting to her new world.

Story (9): The synopsis behind this show really captivates me with it's simplicity, the idea that the story focuses on the power and importance of written words really relates to me, who's personal hobby is writing and creating stories. It also helps in seeing the development of our apathetic heroine, seeing how each client she writes a letter for can have an impact on her stone heart. Giving the series a nice episodic feel and emotional pull.

Art (10): You never fail to amaze me Kyoto Ani, even from watching Hyouka (my first Kyoto Ani anime) I could tell this animation studio was special and excelled in both character animation and emotional story telling. Although A Silent Voice is my favourite of their shows, V.E beautifully displays the highs standards of a dedicated studio. It wouldn't be far fetched to call V.E just meer therapy, but the art alone makes it more valuable then that.

Sound (8): A beautiful symphony of piano and classical. The OP perfectly vocalises the journey of discovery Violet takes in moving to a new home, learning to type effectively and to find her calling in world were peace is now the new norm.

Character (8): Violet pretty much steals the show for me, her simple quest of discovering what the word 'Love' means may see seem simple and innocent, but the underlying themes of PTSD and war destroying one's innocence can offer a sense of tragedy, especially when we see the damage it has on such a badass. It provides interesting, sometimes hilarious and deeply heartbreaking sessions with clients, who each have their own wisdom and story to be recorded on paper. And Although the side characters aren't all that memorable or compelling, the support and patience they give to young Violet is very endearing.

Enjoyment (10): As previously stated, it's hard to combine all the elements of film and television to make weep me like a child. The fact that this show managed to catch me off guard thrice gave a nice shock to the system and makes me excited to watch the attached movie this upcoming summer.

Overall: 10/10. Enter with tissues, but leave with life lessons."

The story is simple, but touches the heart. It is not about the abilities that Violet has, rather the oxymoron of a person without feeling facing situation of emotions (which are carried by the letters that were delivered).

It make me wrote a letter to my wife who sleep beside me everyday. The tear and smile show on her face when she received it just proof how a simple letter bring ""life"" to our simple
                  ...

For those who does not appreciate the anime, I guess they have lost their sight to see the beauty created by the anime. I am now at episode 11 and without watching the ending, I am already decided that this is a masterpiece that is worth for me to create an account and write this review."

But if I can give an assessment, Evergarden violet is an anime that can be said to be worthy of appreciation and praise.

when I first saw episode 1, I was amazed by the visuals. Not only that the music is also appropriate and beautiful. The story is good too, so it feels like watching the continuation of the episode again and again.

Of the 13 episodes that exist, perhaps the most touching episode is episode 10. And maybe many of them after watching it
                  ...
become sad and cry.

And this is one of the elements that makes this anime seem different from other anime, which can make the audience seem to enter the anime itself and feel what happened.

Well, the conclusion is that there are many good anime. and I think the evergarden violet anime is one of the best."

The confusion people seem to be having with this show is that they think it's about a cute girl who's also a kick-ass soldier and does some wicked fighting. This, it most certainly is not. What this show is, however, is the tale of a young girl searching for meaning in a post-war world where she doesn't belong, while simultaneously trying to cope with her past actions. Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece of character development, storytelling, and the emotional payoff (on top of

                                      (11/13 eps)","Violet Evergarden -Despite what the metal arms of the protagonist may have you believe- is not an action-focused show. So if that's what you're looking for then you've already been warned. It's also likely a reason why previous reviews have commented on the slow nature of the first few episodes; expecting action. Rather- it's a story that uses the background of war and conflict to enrich it's main character's conflict and take the viewer on a journey of self-discovery and tears and is definitely worth watching past the first 5 episodes. When I started off watching this show I wasn't expecting to be overwhelmed by
                  ...
creative subplots that brought me to tears nearly every episode. But I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, I rate this anime a 9/10. Reasons are below:(WARNING: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD)

Story(broken up into 3 different aspects of it)- 8/10
Setting: It isn't too hard to believe- it's a post-war society in a place that resembles Eastern Europe. The setting remains consistent throughout the series which makes the world more believable and immersive. They also portray the many places the main Character (Violet Evergarden) beautifully in a way that doesn't distract the viewer from the actual story or characters. There are a couple of things that bother me though- including the fact that they somehow have a perfect control over making metal replacements for entire limbs like in FMA, but have just recently discovered typewriters. A more basic grievance I have is that they never really establish the names of the places they visit- which makes it seem as if the story is all taking place in one big country (Which it isn't) 

Pacing: Like I said in the introductory paragraph, the story starts off almost excruciatingly slow- with small bits of action thrown in to keep the viewer entertained. While it does a good job establishing the main characters in the story that we'll be spending the rest of the show with, the lack of conflict and plot other than that dealing with Violet makes it slower than it has to be. After the first few episodes though, these issues are mostly resolved as the story moves to focus more on Violet's journey of self-discovery and forgiveness. This makes it easier for the plot to move on as the writers no longer need to arduously work to define characters that by themselves have little significance to the overall story.

Story Quality: As much as I enjoyed the overall story, I think the writers were a bit confused when they wrote this. The show starts off by defining the surrounding characters and follows a very linear journey of Violet as she learns to integrate herself into society from war, but immediately after she does so, it moves to a show about her journeying around and the adventures she goes on in those travels. The sudden shift makes it kind of confusing, but the transition isn't TOO abrupt and is a lot easier to follow than other terrible examples of writer indecision I've seen before. The story is nothing if not original and it IS original. 

Art 10/10: The art is absolutely phenomenal. As an aspiring artist myself, I couldn't tear my eyes from the beautiful animation and art that this anime features. Although it suffers from the typical problems like awkward facial expressions in large shots and chibi like expressions when it wants to seem comical, it more than makes up for it with moments that look like they were pulled straight out of an art museum in terms of color palette and beauty. 

Sound 8/10: The music is sometimes very reminiscent of BBC's Sherlock soundtrack, which is definitely a good thing. Though not as memorable, it does its job of complimenting the story as it goes along.

Character: The show does a pretty good job of defining its characters early on, but it suffers from an issue that I've seen in far too many shows; after it's finished giving backstory to it's sided characters, they become almost insignificant the story and makes the viewer feel almost as if they wasted the first few episodes on learning about characters that they never see again. Other than that though, the progression and development of the story's protagonist- Violet Evergarden- is done beautifully and makes the story addicting to keep up with.

Enjoyment: I shed tears of both happiness and sadness throughout this anime, I get the feeling that you will too. The art, soundtrack, and story all add up to make a beautifully comprehensive story of self-discovery that will likely not be forgotten for a very long time."

The first few episodes introduce the character and the world around her in a way that certainly isn't amazing but, is still quite good, while the rest of the season I'd consider to be outstanding. The overlying theme of the show is with out a doubt love. Love of a significant other, love of a mother, father, daughter and love of ones self. As each episode ended, I found myself craving to watch another episode every time because, I knew I would feel an abundance of emotion. Happiness, sadness, anger, fear
                  ...
are just a few of the things I had felt throughout watching this show. Now is this show for everyone? Absolutely not, but for myself? I have found what I believe to be one of the greater  anime's I have ever seen and I simply can't wait to watch more."

Artwork looked really nice, B. Pretty Blonde girl , and C. The rest of winter 2017 anime did not interest me at all. So during the first episode or two, I really enjoyed the artwork like I expected, Ancient Magus Bride came into mind. I wasn’t blown away by what was going on though, my first impression of Violet in these early episodes were a combination of the girl in Koe no Katachi and Saber fused together. But I got annoyed with Violet acting like Saber because
                  ...
Violet acted and felt to me like she was a robot Saber wannabe and not a human. I got an impression that this was an average anime about wars,guns,generals,yawnnn max I would give it is a 6 or 7 out of 10 and I even thought of dropping it while watching Episode 1.

Fast forward 3 episodes or so and I am jizzin my pants at the artwork , music,emotions,and character devolpment combined. And someone who usually only watches one or two episodes of anime a day I binge watched this like 8 episodes in a single day. The last time I did this was like Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood , Fate Zero,etc. Every episode is beautiful, I don’t mean just the artwork , I mean the concepts,story,etc. I constantly wanted to find out what would happen to Violet,what will happen next,etc.  I had no idea this anime would be full of emotions, I highly recommend this anime to people who liked anime such as Angel Beats,Your lie in April,etc. You will not be disappointed."

                                      (10/13 eps)","Disclaimer:
This is my second review. The reason I decided to write this is that no review seemed to do justice to this masterpiece. All of the spoilers I write come from episode 1. If you want to skip those, skip to the second part of the story chapter. 

Genre:
Melodrama (the kind where you know from the start thay you will cry a lot like in Anohana) 

Story (10/10):
Violet Evergarden tells a story of a 14 year old girl who grew up in the army, and lost her commander in the final battle of the war. However, no one can bear to tell her the truth
                  ...
about her commander, so she tries to find out the meaning of his last words ""I love you, Violet."" To do this, she starts working as a letter writer trying to convey people's feelings. This is a very unique story that deserves an 8/10 in my opinion. 

Spoilers over

Where this show really shines though, are it's side stories that start at episode 3 if my memory serves me correctly. Almost every episode portrays the life of people in the aftermath of the war. A lot of them concern people who have lost someone they love, and the scars that has left in their hearts in a very humane way. They show the beauty of life, of love, and how letters made them see the light at the end of the tunnel. Each of these stories are so touching they deserve a 10/10.
The main story progresses slowly but steadily, and every episode revolves around Violet's clients, making Violet Evergarden a very episodic series, so don't expect cliffhangers here. 

Setting:
The show is set on a romanticised victorian era world where a large scale war has just ended. The world diverges only little from our world. Their alphabet and history are different, but that doesn't deter from the story. However our main character has more advanced arm protheses than what we have today similar to Fullmetal Alchemist. I didn't mind that though since I love the fantasy genre. 

Characters (9/10):
Having grown up in the army, Violet is an emotionally lacking girl who lost her arms in the war. She is exact and strict with herself and slowly learns to understand emotions. Having grown up in the army, she excels at everything that requires precision or diligence. It is difficult to connect with her at first, but she is slowly developed and her backstory revealed. (9/10)
In the company that Violet works at there are about four other letter writers that don't get much air time apart from one of them. They mainly serve as comparison to what successful letter writers are like in contrast to Violet. (6/10)
Here too the strong points of this show are the episodic side characters with so beautiful and sad backgrounds they have made me cry a couple of times. The people's grudges and regrets however get resolved in a way that has left me speechless time and time again through the letters that our heroine writes. Each episode after the first couple are built in a way that slowly reveals the side characters' history and the letters always tie the episode well together. (10/10)

Art (10/10):
I have never seen such outstanding art in an anime. Not even in Your name. The expressions are detailed, the backround sharp, and the animations fluid. The art does not try to express people listening on conversations with 5x bigger ears or the like but stays consistent as is expected of the genre. There was one episode in particular that left me in awe of the impressive animation (episode 6 or 7).

Sound (8/10):
The voice acting is great and the feelings come across, but I'm not very good at appraising it. At least I haven't heard any part with bad voice acting...  The ending is also, how do I put it... unique. There is also some background music, but I rarely pay attention to those so I am not appraising them.

Enjoyment and overall (10/10):
As most of the show has already been resolved, I can confidently say that Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece and the best anime of the season. It also topped my previous favourite Your name. The main story progresses slowly revolving around side stories each one more beautiful than the last, until it hits you with a few main story episodes that really touch your kokoro. The structure of the show is so different that it may be hard to get into at first, but the main attraction for the first ~7 episodes are the side stories. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes the drama genre like Anohana and Your name, or who is searching for very realistic and humane depictions of people like in Breaking Bad. Also, if you are searching for something Victorian after watching Gosick, this is the show. Don't watch if you hate the idea of a slow paced main story or are in search of action (this is drama.) 

Having now seen how touching letters can be I really feel like receiving one. Please give me constructive critique about my review and if there are bad grammar mistakes, do tell since I'm not a native speaker. :)"

I'm just a normal guy trying to watch some anime. Now when I looked at VE on MAL I was really surprised at the amount of <5* reviews. Now I'll be the first to admit that VE is not perfect, there are some really weird logic fails. ie little girl jumping 20 feet into the air and stabbing and killing like 10 people. I think it's safe to say that's just anime doing its anime things. So, I'm just gonna do that review
                  ...
format thing that everyone decides to do so.... uh, yeah, let me just get into that I guess.

Story - 9

So, yeah, I gave the story a 9/10 because the story was incredibly beautiful. I've seen a couple other people say this but yeah, the story is pretty simplistic, it's about a little girl who has known nothing but war try to find what love means. Each episode is essentially its own little story in itself, giving little snapshots of life in different stages. Each episode also grows Violet's character somewhat, because she has to deal with all these emotional troubles, her emotionless character has to react in ways she never has. Yeah, that's about it, I think a lot of the bad reviews might have a little to do with the expectations of what it was going to be. I think a lot of people maybe thought it would be a bit more grandiose.

Art - 10

KyoAni, honestly, is there anything else to say?

Sound - 9

OST was great and really set the stage for the anime, there were a few scenes where the background music overpowered the characters but it's not as if it was irredeemable. Still amazing.

Characters - 8

I think a big thing that a lot of people gave VE criticism for was the lack of character for Violet. I will admit it is a little unrealistic for Violet to have absolutely zero emotions but considering how she was treated by everyone in the military besides Gilbert I can imagine how she would end up like that. I mean, she was effectively a slave, you have to stay stoic in situations like that, there's no room for emotions.I do agree, though, in some way, I think the character development was a little slow, the first 4 or so episodes had little to do with actual development of her character. I believe the development was a little bit on the slow side, and the side character were also kind of bland, but to be honest, you don't see them too much anyways so it's not too much of an issue. Also, the new character introduced each episode actually surprised me. Although they were limited to the ""tell"" method, the characters actually had a lot of depth and emotion behind what they were doing. You could actually relate with most of the character in each of these individual episodes.

Overall - 9

Though not perfect, it is a really enjoyable experience. I've noticed that a lot of the reviews have only watched 4 episodes or so and I'm going to tell you straight up; you need to watch more. This show has a very slow build up and honestly, at episode 11, I don't think its done. No one knows for sure how the end is going to be, but we can only hope it's amazing.


TL;DR

It's good, beginning is slow though."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Fairy Tail ~ Another battle shounen anime to join the glorious world of anime. Adapted from the manga written by Hiro Mashima of the same name. 
Now before you continue reading I must warn you that if you haven't seen all the episodes or are a huge fan that can't take criticism please refrain from reading this review. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
For those yet reading this review please keep an open mind about what you are going to read.
Initially I did enjoy fairy tail but in the end i started disliking the series. Here are a few reasons why

First of all the arcs are short.
                  ...
Which means there's a lot of things they can't do, bigger story, adventure or exploring, showing more of the side characters, etc. Every arc ends up boring to me and not memorable. The arc size also makes it so predictable. They have to go there without knowing much, be beaten by the enemies easily, get back up and run after them, beat them, a little talk afterwards, then go home.

The fillers, Fairy Tail has horrible fillers. Like the Daphne arc and the Starry Key filler arc. Just unbelievably bad. ABove that the filler arc is the second longest arc in the whole series. For those who might argue that fair tail has ""less"" fillers let me point out that FT has 38 filler episodes out of a total of 175. That's 21% filler, which is quite a lot.

Lisanna~They took a nice little cute backstory that helped multiple characters and ruined it. Brought her back without a good explanation and then afterwards nothing has changed. She barely talks to Natsu, she isn't important in the story. It was better when she was gone. Her being back and doing nothing basically ruins the whole flashback which was supposed to show how much she thought of Natsu, he thought of her, how Elfman decided to get stronger after losing her, Mirajane changed to be nicer, etc.

There's no training neither any foreshadowing. None of them really change. They were only going to train once but then Mashima said screw you, they're going to instead get powered up in 5 minutes. Natsu had a chance to grow with his powers near the beginning. He learned that he could use his flame to hold things or whatever. He forgot right after, lost a good chance and it hasn't showed up again yet.

Natsu's a horrible character. He's a main protagonist of the worst type, cocky yet can't prove it. Always runs ahead and gets beaten easily by the enemies, then he gets up and is able to beat the main boss of the arc. He needs a power up every fight or he loses, he sometimes has to get insulted until he's angry enough to beat him. Why the hell can't they give him a fire lacrima to use in a fight, he always has to get fire from some inconvenient ways. He even forgave Gajeel after he beat Lucy for like an hour, talked to him all nicely about dragons after their fight.

I couldn't even care about any of the characters. They are contrived, one dimensional, stereotypical and lack even the little bit of depth that the story sometime requires.

Natsu's power is supposed to be unique. Yet, every arc they run into a new dragon slayer. And then they run into god slayers that's powers are even stronger than their dragon slayer counterparts. It's like he's making it up as he goes.

The comedy is annoying. Natsu's vehicle sickness got boring when it screwed up his chance to fight, which was by like the 8th episode. After that it's just been used way too much and has messed with his fighting multiple times since. Gray has to strip every god damn episode, they haven't thought of giving him a jumpsuit or whatever. Everyone elses comedy is boring. The only person who ever says something funny is Happy.

The action sucked, all the fights weren't interesting and of course were full of random powerups and bad comedy. The animation of the fights were mediocre and most fight end in Natsu consuming fire in some convenient way for the plot or getting help from his ""nakama"" and magically beating the enemy who seemed overpoweringly strong till now.

Story is nothing special. Nothing has really changed since the beginning.

Oh the time skip. I totally forgot about mentioning that. It was horrible, a 7 year skip. They didn't even let the mains train or whatever. They came back and were easily able to beat enemies that had almost beaten them 7 years ago and had been training the whole time they were gone.

All in all Fairy tail happens to be one of the worst battle shounens i have ever seen and this is coming from a guy who has seen a fair amount of shounen.
With this I end my rant.

To those rating this review as ""Helpful"" or ""Not Helpful"" your feedback is greatly appreciated."

                                      (138/175 eps)","Those that are done raging between anime/manga adaptions feel free to read. Those who still don't understand why books and movies will ever be the same feel free to go away. With that being said, Fairy Tail is easily the best Shounen anime to date! Take this from a non-hardcore shounen fan. Granted, i do enjoy shounen as a casual viewer (despite me seeing over 3000 shounen eps) but I stand by my statement 100%

Sounds a little bit shallow but please let me elaborate. There have been countless shounen anime throughout the decades. Some lasting a few dozen episodes, others spanning 100's of episodes. Ever
                  ...
since Astro Boy, children all over the world have been enjoying cartoons such as these, but they all had one thing in common, countless flaws. If you are watching any of the big three, you know what they are. Long fights, long story arcs, long recaps, long explanations, annoying characters... basically tricks to extend the length of an anime series. 

Fairy Tail takes all those ideas and throws them in the trash. You want short, awesome fights that does not last for weeks? Check! You want story arcs that are full of action, comedy, and a little seriousness? You got it! Most importantly, aren't you tired of characters explaining/chanting their fighting moves every time they use it?!?! I'm looking at you Bleach and One Piece~! Fairy Tail takes all the things that makes watching shounen anime great and throws out all the junk that that makes shounen ...well, junk. 

In the beginning, it looks like it is an atypical shounen story of a boy/girl trying their best to improve their skills. Although it has that element, it is all about being part of a team. This team is the mages guild called Fairy Tail. A motley crew of mages with their own unique fighting styles, personalities and looks. There are so many characters in this show, one would find it hard not to like 3-5 characters out of the lot. Watching only 22 episodes, and you will be introduced to over 2 dozen members of fairy tail. Even the way they introduce all of their characters and their powers is awesome. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, such is the case here. It's a shoot first, ask questions later style, which how it SHOULD be. 

Since that is the case, less time is taken to explain things you already know and actually put toward story and character development. Another amazing feat done by this anime series... episode recaps last LESS THAN 30 seconds! Talk about innovative! I know purists complain that it ""doesn't follow the manga to the word!"" but really, what manga does? I may sound like a broken record but if you keep an open mind, you can see this series is a cut above the rest. All arcs are told in typical anime fashion, problem arises and the team must stop them. But I'll be damned if you cant get excited seeing all the action and/or comedy that is packed in to a half hour. It will even manage to surprise you in more ways than one! ""Kya!"" Comes to mind. 

With the sheer number of characters, you would think there would not be enough time or story for all of them. But they all get more than enough airtime considering they're not the main four characters. Natsu, Grey, Lucy, and Happy will of course, be the ones being followed the most, but you will see how much everyone else will be in the shot. My personal favorites are Mirajane and Ezra. On the topic of favorites, you will notice there are a large number of A-list seiyuu participating in this anime series as well. You might notice the voices of Ranka Lee, Taiga Aisaka, Izumi Konata, or even Saya Otonashi, are in here. Main or support, the voice cast can not be ignored. 

Another thing that can not be ignored is wide screen format and overall high production value of the animation. Usually quality drops after a few episodes, but for an anime style such as this, it lends itself on opportune times to use low quality animation over high quality and for the most part works amazingly well. It sure might look like One Piece at a glance but if you compare the two, the difference is like night and day. It is actually a little more comparable to Soul Eater if i had to put a comparison to it. 

I'm not saying this anime is perfect in any way. Theres a little flaws that nit pickers might see like the ""reuse"" of certain animated scenes namely the incantations. Or how the ""quality"" drops in a few scenes. But isn't that the case with ALL anime? Those problems I mentioned are so subtle and minuscule you will only notice them if you're looking for things to hate about watching this show. To be honest, from the first two dozen episodes, there is nothing overly bad from watching this shounen anime. I would normally say its bad simply because it is a shounen anime, but this has everything I wanted fixed in watching a shounen anime. I especially love how they can pull ""random"" (i.e. filler) episodes off of the guild message board and go with it. It almost resembles an RPG in that sense. Happenstance encounters or weird pauses in story arcs to start a different one are rare in this sense. The players are all in their place and we are there to watch everything flow nice and easy. Here's to hoping this will last a few hundred episodes."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"Fairy Tail is definitely one of the most popular shounen anime and if you are thinking of watching it based on this fact alone, then I encourage you to read some reviews first. I have one small request, reader. Please try to keep your egos in tact and read the review before evaluating it. We all have our reasons to like or not a show.Thank you. Stay tuned.

I am still amazed at myself that I managed to watch all of this series, but that only indicates that there are some positives to it and I somehow enjoyed it all. What can be said about the
                  ...
story? Nothing really special, a girl named Lucy wants to become a wizard in a famous guild and after she meets Natsu, one of its members, she manages to join him and thus, they form a team and start on taking missions and embark on journeys. Natsu is trying to find his parent, a dragon who raised him and taught him rare magical skills and abilities based on fire. Although the concept of guilds, which is taken from online games is interesting, it is in no way original.

The story progresses in arcs with each arc being connected nicely with the next one and the transition between them feels smooth and logical. The atmosphere and the nature of each arc generally remain the same lighthearted and cheerful vibe following the vibe of the anime on its whole, except for some moments and scenes which need to be dark to show the contradiction between good and evil. Although, the story of each individual arc can be described as cliche, you could at least expect the execution to be masterful for a popular anime like this, right? No, they decided to shit all over the place with the word mediocrity, though there are some glimpses of good storytelling and directing in some arcs, but this is exactly what they are, glimpses. Individual elements of each arc are interesting  but the story itself is unoriginal, although how it's told and executed is what counts the most and this show had the potential to be great, but they vomited it all out to appeal to the general public and/or their target group If this was their purpose than they nailed it. Linear, repetitive and predictable storytelling and the use of generic guidelines as in any typical shounen of this type leave no room for the element of surprise for some rare plot twists that might exist.Also the amount of fan service, aka huge breasts for almost every female and semi nudity for males, is staggering at the least. Generally, the arcs are short and leave no room for good development and the pace of each arc is out of place. I felt that some arcs needed faster pace but others slower, go figure. Some episodes are uneventful with no action and on top of that no story or character development of any kind. Dialogues are mediocre and superficial for the most part but there are comedic moments where combined with sound and animation made me actually laugh hard. The blend of action, comedy and drama is mediocre and as I already mentioned ""Oh the potential!!!!"".

Animation is one of this anime strong parts. For a long running show, it is pretty consistent in quality and is very good. Colors are bright and cheerful which suit the anime very much and they adjust well to the atmosphere and the mood of the scene. Facial expressions are distinct and well portrayed. The designs of characters are unique and suit their personalities quite well which in consequence make them somehow memorable. The only complain I had is in the moment of fight scenes which could be depicted better and in more detail.

My favorite part ironically or not was the sound. My gosh it was incredible!!! I actually searched and downloaded some soundtracks of this anime and I usually don't do that. The sad music and ost's in the epic moments of the anime are just amazing. OP and ED songs are really great you will love them trust me.Incredible is the fact that the soundtracks match their arc themes and the moments of sadness,joy,tension,mystery and action too damn well. There were parts in the anime that wasn't that melodramatic but with the right ost it actually managed to invoke from me a sad emotion. Also, I don't remember any misuse of sound, it was just perfect. Voice actors are all good and for the most part, fit well to the characters.   

Fairy Tail's characters is another disappointing fact. We are introduced to a large cast of characters who are one dimensional and static. Main characters are flat and underdeveloped. I understand that combined with short arcs there isn't much room left to develop so many of them, but they could at least try. Every stereotype of this genre can be found in this series, from the typical hotheaded male protagonist to the evil villain who becomes good and changes sides and the fact that most of them remain the same throughout the series makes this show even more predictable. It's impossible to be caught by surprise when you expect for them to act based on their generic stereotype and they act exactly like that in any given situation. The villains of the show are equally as underdeveloped as the main characters. Of course, there are some exceptions and we can see  glimpses of good development here and there which are later ruined to the bones. So much good development is so brutally destroyed, that it is frustrating even to imagine the potential of this series. Nonetheless, there are likeable characters whom you will want to cheer for but that doesn't change the fact that most of them are flat and superficial.

The last disappointing fact I want to mention, is the fighting scenes. Battle system is your typical ""raw strength+power ups wins"" concept. Almost no amount of thought or originality can be traced anywhere. Some abilities are cool, but that's it. The battles are won by overpowering the enemy and no strategical thinking is involved. Superficial and annoyingly tiring dialogues and monologues which ruin the pace of the story take place in every fight scene and I mean literally in EVERY fight scene. I know that concepts like friendship and comradeship are important, don't misunderstand me, but not when they are in excess and feel like they try to nail it in my brain with a drill and on top of that, at the expense of the story. Power levels are confusing as one reviewer stated. There are no trainings but main characters manage to win enemies they shouldn't be able to win like ever. Oh yea, I forgot the power of friendship and nakamas!!! Silly me.

Generally this whole thing can be summed up in 6 steps.
Step 1: A strong enemy appears. MC's are beaten up by the enemy.
Step 2: MC's yell about friendship and the power of nakamas.
Step 3: They power up emotionally and physically by the power of friendship and random stuff.
Step 4: MC's overpower the villain.
Step 5: No training of any kind whatsoever.
Step 6: New arc. Go to step 1.
When an anime can be summed up like this than in my books this is not good at all.

All in all, Fairy Tail generally has a vibe of positivity and lightheartedness. If you like characters that seem cool, raw power, mc's that overpower their enemies who rely on their friends and protect each other, if you like good animation with awesome soundtracks mixed perfectly to every scene, if you liked something like D-Gray Man or Bleach than you should watch this show and I am sure you will enjoy it very much. I definitely recommend this to children, as well. But if you are an experienced anime viewer or if you like intelligence, good story, plot and character development, if you like insane plot twists and strategic battle scenes with complex fighting systems or if you want to watch something of this genre but don't have much time than don't waste it on this and watch something like Hunter x Hunter or Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Fairy Tail isn't so much a bad anime, it's just over-welcomed it's stay. It was a one trick pony that was constantly played until you get annoyed and see the repetitive nature of the show and it's sad because this had a lot of potential to be really good .

Story - (3/10)
This is one of the weaker aspects of Fairy Tail as it gets daunting and rather boring because there is no real progression, and it becomes incredibly predictable with how it will play out, at first it was pretty fun since the stories did serve a proper purpose and introduced us to some other
                  ...
characters but as it goes on, you feel that it's afraid to make changes to the characters so they just write what they know and that's where the repetitiveness comes from. The gags were funny for the first 20 episodes but then they get really old fast as well as the fanservice, it even gags at important moments, you could have a serious fight but instead have a comedy bit in the middle completely ruining the mood for the fight.

Art - (6/10)
The animation is pretty good for a shounen anime as it can be fast paced and some of the magic does look pretty cool but at the same time, the designs of most characters seem really plain looking, minus maybe 2-3 characters everyone else looks really generic.

Sound - (9/10)
Quite possibly the best thing about Fairy is the sound as it mixes irish folk music with some modern day sounds blending really well and does match the battles that happen, this was something I am glad they kept as it was something very different from the norm. The OP's and ED's were also very nice to listen to and mainly composed of some very energetic pop music.

Characters - (2/10)
This is by far the worst aspect for Fairy Tail, one dimensional, bland, incredibly cliche and just lacked development. I will start off with the main character Natsu who is to me one of the worst MC's in anime ever. He never develops, there is no challenge for him, he doesn't have any conflicts with how he does things its just 'I'll beat the crap out of you' no matter how evil that person is, even if they kill someone he will still treat it more like a sparring match rather than him losing control and losing himself in the process of it, if he's always going to be this guy who doesn't think and just swings away then its going to get really boring really fast.He doesn't so much get stronger but rather uses the power of friendship after making a speech and wins. Lucy is another character I just could not handle because she was just fanservice and a plot device, she didn't get stronger each time, she just gets caught in a messy situation, screams a bit, summons a spirit and that's it, her character seems to be a key for the arc to go through but apart from that she is utterly useless. Now despite all the bashing of the characters I will say that there are some decent characters like Erza, Wendy, Gajeel and Gray because most of them did get stronger and developed and were conflicted with how they did things but even they can fall victim to lousy progression.

Enjoyment - (4/10)
It was fun at first but once the story and comedy repeated all the time, you get sick of it and switch to something else straight away, there is no proper pacing and some arcs went for too long that you don't feel as invested or interested any more to care

Overall - (3/10)
Fairy Tail lacked a lot of important elements and was clearly confused as to what it wanted to be, it was either over the top battle or a comedy, it was too messy to balance both because it couldn't have the comedy at the right time, I wouldn't recommend this anime because it's fallen to the many cliches and doesn't really bring anything solid to the table."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Story (3/10): Oh god. People praise this as one of- No. THE best shounen anime out there. HAHAHAHAHAHA, no way dude. I swear, the writers follow a step by step process on a poster hung up in their office when creating this. This is what the poster reads: 1. Fairy Tail is aware of some evil people. 2. The regular Natsu, Lucy, and Happy group, sometimes with Gray and Erza, set out for adventure and to beat the bad people. 3. They find the bad dudes, and these bad dudes are seriously bad dudes. 5. A guild member (usually Lucy) is put in danger 5.
                  ...
Natsu attempts to fight them but they are far too strong. 6. Cue flashback/motivational speech about friendship. 7. This will then summon this random ""will power"" within Natsu. 8. Natsu beats the seriously bad dudes that are way OP for him and shouldn't be able to beat. 9. Celebration and breathing. 10. Back to the guild for absolute shite humour consisting of Juvia loving Gray, Gray taking his clothes off, Erza hurting people, Natsu destroying crap or eating, Lucy is making stupid faces because of what the guild members are doing, and brown hair girl is drinking. 11. Return to step 1 for the beginning of a new arc.

Art (6/10): My only complaint is the magic. I feel like is could be much better quality. Like, Natsu's flames looked like fire animations you'd pick up on Clipart or something. Apart from that, I suppose the art was pretty solid. Y'know, not outstanding, but just average.

Sound (6/10): Asides the less than average sound effects that is to be expected in all lengthy shounen, everything was pretty sweet. Fairy Tail had a nice OST, good OP's/ED's, and decent voice acting.

Characters (3/10): Of the 141 episodes I watched, every character did not change one bit. Even after that, however long timeskip it was, nobody changed. Except for their appearance I suppose. The villains, the villains, the villans... They are so awfully cliché, I want to vomit. Think of the most generic super villain you can think of. Done? Alright. Yeah, he/she's in this. People just trying to destroy the world, or cover it in darkness, etc etc etc. Pathetic. Now if we move onto Natsu, I have a complaint. Tell me how he could defeat all of these villains. They were over powered to the max... Like at that crystal joint (tower to heaven or something of the likes?), that guy was WAY out of his league, but no. All he had to do was have thoughts of Erza, and he's gold. I can't remember what he did, but I think he merged with the crystals? Either way, it's a last minute power up and that sort of crap ruins series. There are a lot more examples, but my memory is so bad (I'm editing this 5 months after I wrote the review, and even longer after I dropped it).

Enjoyment (2/10): I enjoyed it for a long time while I was still in my newborn anime diapers. I'm pretty sure this was my 4th or 5th anime ever. So obviously, I had no real taste, and sort of just watched and liked whatever I watched. But now that I've been watching anime for a while now, I see that this series is just crap. One hundred and seventy something episodes of pure repetition, garbage humour, and cliché villains.

Overall (3/10): Definitely not the best shounen anime. In fact. The worst (very close worst next to Bleach). I've watched every episode and read every chapter so far of One Piece, and Fairy Tail doesn't hold a match to One Piece. Of the 650+ episodes of One Piece I've seen, there has been, yes, MC's beating over powered characters, friendship flashbacks for random ""will power"" etc. But the level of repetitiveness is FAR less noticeable in One Piece. I'm not saying OP's a masterpiece, but it's definitely light years beyond Fairy Tail in terms of ""the best shounen to date"".

And then I watched Hunter X Hunter."

                                      (119/175 eps)","This is only my third review, and im am not a very skilled english-writer, but please bear with me.

Fairy Tail itself is one of my favorite series. I will try not to compare the anime too much with the manga, since this a a review for the ANIME, but i must note that the fairy tail MANGA is my favorite shounen manga, and i have been following that series for years, also before the anime show started.

Why people should watch Fairy Tail? well if you like the shoune genre, it would really be a waste if you don't! Fairy Tail have all the good shounen
                  ...
points, amazing characters, amazing fights, comedy, and best of all; no long explanations during every fight and every attack (I am reffering to the big top 3 here).

Story: The Story in fairy tail is amusing, but there indeed is not very much plot going on here. Most of the things happening seems rather random. But the story is set up on a group of people in a mage guild named Fairy Tail, where the series main topic probably is friendship between them. With at story like this, not having any special plot actually works. Instead of plot, we have fun and interesting small arcs all the time, which never makes Fairy Tail boring! And we all have to remember that Fairy Tail is still on-going, and there is lot of unanswered questions yet to figure out, so it is possible for a deeper plot to pop up in the end!


Art: Here i must compare a little to the Manga (Sorry). The manga have AMAZING art, however the animation in the manga is not near as good. This is also the main reason why i won't give this anime a overall score on 10. To be honest, when i watched the first episode of Fairy Tail in 2009, i have been looking forward for it to air the whole day, and i was a little disappointed when i watched it. worse was it, that from episode 2 and on to episode 15-20, the animation keept being bad, well, the little animation there where! Fairy Tail, both in openings/endings and in the episodes themself like to use A LOT of non-moving pictures, which is a shame, because fairy tail haves potentiale to have some really kick ass scenes.
The fights lack a little too compared to the manga, or just other shounen series, because of the BLOOD censur (which annoys be greatly! We can not show blood in the anime, but naked girls is no problem!)

however, the anime still manages to have some good fights, where the Erza arc was animated pretty good, and so some of the other big fights.

also, a lot of people have been talking about Fairy Tail being a rip off or copy from One Piece. that is deffintly not true! Yes, the art is somewhat similar and yes both series are a lot about their ""nakamas"" for really, its two very different stories. Try sit down and read shojo, i can find over 10 stories with different mangakas, but with similar art and story. Fairy Tail and One Piece are NOT the same, Fairy Tail is NOT a rip off, DON'T compare them, seriously ..

Sound: 

Fairy Tail have without doubt the most EPIC soundtracks! It makes you go ""hell yeah, go fairy tail"" everytime the main theme for their fighting scenes plays, and it makes you cry, when the sad themes are played during sad scenes. 

Fairy Tail also have an amazing Voice Acting cast (In japanese) with some of the very popular seiyuu's, like Happy's voice actor Kugimiya Rie (Alphonse, Taiga, Shana, Louise, etc) and Lucy's voice actor Hirano Aya (Suzumiya Haruhi, Izumi Konata, etc) and my own favorites, Natsu and Gray's voice actors Kakihara Tetsuya (Simon, Amaimon, etc) and Nakamura Yuuichi (Tomoya, Greed, Gai, Ikuto, etc) and there are a lot more amazing voice actors, but that would be too much to list here now. Go check out for yourself!

Character: There are a lot of characters in Fairy Tail, it should be possible to at least find a few you would like. To me, all the characters are very likeable, i specially like our Main hero Natsu, because he seems bold, but he actually isn't stupid or slow or dense like other typical shounen heros are. Also with our characters, fairy tail manage to create some interesting relationships between our characters, both deep friendship, but also romantic ones, which usally is really rare in shounen. I'm sure that there haven't been lots of girls, watching series like Bleach, One Piece or Naruto and just wishing for some romantic relationships to happen. Well i will say that Fairy Tail manages to give you - maybe not fully canon - but surely lots of romantic possible relationship.

Enjoyment: Unless you really have a problem with half naked girls and breasts, which you really cannot escape from in Fairy tail however much i wish for it, it should not be possible for anyone to not enjoy this anime! It is just hilarious and funny but still have its good and serious moments, and even some complicated relationships between some of our characters, and Fairy Tail manage to surprise me lots of times too!

I will reccomend this anime to all people who like shounen, or like a fun anime with lots of comedy.
There might be some girls, like myself, who doesn't find the fan service rather interesting (Yes - boobs, huge boobs and LOTS of them) but i myself just learned to look over it, since most of the times, this fanservice is invovled with something funny, which really just makes you laugh of it anyway. For guys who like this kind of fan service.. so much more reason for you to watch it!

All in all. Wanna watch a funny, interesting and good anime? Watch Fairy Tail.

And if you like fairy tail, i would really reccomend reading the Manga too. But that would mostly be because of the fact that the art is awesome, and manga contains blood, which makes the fighting scenes look a little more badass, and characters like Gray, is often drawn very hot and cool in the manga, where he get less epic moments in the Anime. Other than that, the Anime and Manga is pretty much the same, i'm surprised to have watched 119 episodes of Fairy Tail, and there haven't been any massive fillers yet. i will believe there have been all in all 10 episodes out of the 119 which have contained fillers, and that was not BAD fillers, and it wasn't 10 episodes in a row, so it made a annoying filler arc. Also the Fairy Tail anime likes to animate some of the many Fairy Tail Special/Extra/Omakes chapters and put them into the series or create some amazing hilarious OVA episodes out of them."

                                      (103/175 eps)","Fairy Tail. You had so much potential.

The story starts in a similar fashion like most shounens, a girl named Lucy dreams of becoming a wizard to join a prestigious guild. As soon as she meets Natsu her life is changed dramatically. In the process she goes on magical adventures, facing enemies with her friends along the way. The first episode gave me a quick preview of Fairy Tail, and along the way I made quick assumptions. Natsu seems to be your generic hot-blooded, brawling-fanatic main character and Lucy felt like another damsel in distress slash sidekick. I know I was making shallow judgments based on
                  ...
this exposure but it turns out I right. Unfortunately enough watching more episodes I was introduced to many typical character archetypes. One that stood out was Erza. Just by studying her actions and interactions with characters I could classify her with one word, ""Tsundere"". This is not a very good sign when you can summarize characters with one word or in one sentence. For other character archetypes you get the rival (Gray), the playboy (Loki), the all-powerful, perverted master (Makarov), manly man (Elfman), arrogant power boss (Laxus), the fangirl (Juvia), and MANY more. As soon as the ""Job Posting"" wall was introduced through out the plot I instantly knew that this was going to be arc based. You know the drill; the mangaka is going invent and make up the story as he goes along. The fighting is extremely predictable for the most part: Villain Team/Guild vs. Fairy Tail. Mini tournaments are emphasized because of the cluster of villains and heroes. It's usually someone from each team/guild fighting One-on-One and then leaving Natsu or Natsu and said teammates against the main boss of the arc. Side characters usually defeat the lesser villains and ultimately the one to essentially defeat the big ""arc boss"" is Natsu which is incredibly unfortunate. Power levels are quite confusing. For example, Natsu defeats a supposedly powerful enemy like Jellal in the previous arc but then he gets defeated in the following arc by a seemingly less powerful villain. The humor is quit entertaining but that does not account for the mediocre filler episodes. Major character development is yet to be discovered, pretty much everyone stays exactly the same. The plethora of side characters are not worth mentioning because they add so little with the plot except fight the villains in the ""mini-tournaments"" and add comic relief with the exception of Wendy, Laxus, Charlie, Gildartz, and Gajeel. Fighting is quite Dragon Ball Z like, this is most evident in the Natsu and Gajeel fight. Most of the time it boils down to Deux-Ex-Machina moments like constant random power ups directly (mainly towards Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza),""Nick of the time"" character save situations and ""My magical attack/technique is stronger than your magical attack/technique"" sayings. Did I mention Hiro is obsessed with friends and friendship speeches? With the power of your friends and your ""nakama"" behind you can conquer any challenge in this universe, in other words if you see a villain who is not so pro-friendship they are for sure going to be defeated and be unsuccessful in their plans.  I know friendship is amazing but don't over-saturate it to point where it's obviously forced down our throats.

Fairy Tail is a great example of an average Shounen. Perfect for people who are new to the Shounen genre but those who are are experienced will be disappointed.  

Pros:
+Everything a Shounen symbolizes
+Entertaining and Humorous to an Extent
+Some Memorable Characters (Happy, Gajeel, Laxus, Ultear, Mest...)
+Friendly Environment and Atmosphere
+Fan service for both Sexes

Cons:
-No Originality 
-Plenty Shounen Tropes and Cliches
-Too many Static Characters (Natsu, Gray, Erza, Gajeel, Lucy, Master, Loki... etc.)
-Uneven Character Spotlights (i.e. Too much Natsu, Erza, Lucy and not enough screen time for other more interesting characters)
-Formulaic/Predictable Story Telling 
-No Major Character Development 
-Dues Ex Machina Moments"

                                      (85/175 eps)","Action Shounen's are a genre im very familar with having watched more than i could possibly name so naturally i was drawn to Fairy Tail which seems to be the next big ""never ending story"" which as of this review has over 90 episodes. While the premise of the series is interesting being about magic and guilds, ultimatley the series fails to really break any new grounds and throughout the course of the 80 odd episodes i've seen has really left me with a reoccuring feeling of déjá vu.

Story

As you are probably aware, the story begins with a teenage girl named Lucy Heartfilia who has
                  ...
set out to become a mage of the world famous guild Fairy Tail. During her search she inadvertently meets a boy named Natsu Dragneel a dragon slayer who has a very fiery personality as well as a huge appetite and is searching for a dragon by the name of Igneel along with his flying blue cat companion named Happy. Natsu invites Lucy to be a mage in the Fairy Tail guild and the two form a partnership along with the ice mage Gray Fullbuster and s-class mage as well as team leader of their quartet Erza Scarlet and as a team embark on various quests and adventures. 

The story is seperated into many arcs which is typical of action shounen, each arc is quite short, generally 10 episodes or less (although the last two have exceeded this number) with very few filler in between. This is where the feeling of déjá vu kicks in for me because over the course of the series each arc seems to follow the same basic structure. You have your main antagonist along with his or hers henchman threatening to obtain or destroy something that effects the balance of peace in the world of Fairy Tail to which of course the mage's of the Fairy Tail guild in particular Natsu, Lucy, Gray and Erza are there to oppose them. You may be thinking to yourself  ""hey doesn't the majority of action Shounen boil down to good vs evil?"" but in Fairy Tail while there are some good ones, most arcs are told in the same bland, repetitive, unimaginative and predictable way. To start the main bad guy and his henchman tend to put a beatdown on the Fairy Tail members. Natsu vows to win round 2 at all cost and take down the main antagonist because he is the only one who can and wether its through sheer will power, friendship or some other power up thats what happens and the threat is stopped. Throw in one of the Fairy Tail members (usually Erza) willing to sacrafice themselves before being stopped at the very last moment by Natsu who delivers them a very cliché speech. Then add the main antagonists of this series following the same basic pattern of going from calculative to crazed during the heat of battle to finally either remorseful for their actions in defeat or plain forgotten about the very next arc and folks you have a Fairy Tail arc. The lack of significant consequences at the conclusion for most arcs or the feeling that the story is continously building in a well structured manner, doesn't help its cause either. 

The tone of the anime is very light hearted, there's no blood and while death is explored the lives of the Fairy Tail characters or bad guys rarely feel like they are in any significant danger. Even when its insinuated, you know everything is going to turn out okay. The series is also very heavy with humor and wackiness most of which fall flat as the jokes tend to come off very forced. There is also quite a bit of fan service with girls with big boobs and skimpy clothing which really isn't a positive or negative for me.

Characters

Natsu is your typical dense, stubborn main shounen hero with an affinity for food and Lucy is your weak, smart, sexy female character. Each of the characters in the Fairy Tail guild tend to have common traits or unsual quirks for instance Natsu's motion sickness which leaves him incapacitated, Gray's always unconsciously stripping his clothes off, Erza being a tsundere and guild master Makarov being an old pervert ect. Throughout the course of the series we get a decent back story on the four main characters + Happy aswell as some of the supporting cast. While the series does well to show some of the hardships the chracters went through there really is very little character development outside of this and for the most part there is even a lack of explanation for what motivated the characters to join the fairy tail guild or what their goals are while there.

While it doesn't stand out in any big way, the art is clean and vibrant and the character designs are very similar to Hiro Mashima's other series Rave and is typical of what you would come to expect from a shounen series in this day and age. At the beginning of the series the animation was quite poor and there was an overuse of magic circles and still frames but as the series progresses this gets toned down dramatically and there is a notable improvement in the animation. The sound is another good aspect of the show it borrows heavily from old english folk music which really works well with themes of magic and festival that inspires Fairy Tail. A warning to those reading you may want to skip over the openings and endings of Fairy Tail they usually spoil alot of whats going on in a upcoming or current arc. 

Final Words

Fairy Tail is a series with alot of potential that a lack of creativy, originality and at times pacing stop it from being anything more than another generic action shounen anime. Its a show i could reccomend to someone who is new to the genre, enjoys generally short arcs with little filler, a younger viewer or someone who is a big fan of the whole magic and guilds theme. To those who have already 'seen it all' in this genre, particularly an anime like One Piece, there's really is no good reason for you to be watching this series unless you have time to kill."

                                      (99/175 eps)","Sometimes there will be shows that will make you laugh and cry. Sometimes the shows will raise realistic questions, and sometimes shows will leave a bitter scar in your heart. Shounen genre is the champion of genre when it comes to long running, and it is infamous for its action, and known for exploring an interesting specific topic, whether it is ninja, samurai, pirates or shinigami. Most shounen develope from the Japanese myths and culture, while some (recently even more) decides to tell the story of distant land. Fairy Tail is one of the rare shounens that tells the story of magic, set in more
                  ...
of European style with guilds and magicians and mage and magic with theme of ""friendship"" and ""victory"". 

The most reputable part of the series is its music. Sountracks are top-notch, opening and ending songs are high quality and voice acting is decent. For most and any shounen, this trait is same. Fancy opening to uplift the mood with calmer endings, accompanied by some better soundtracks, music definitely is a strong point of the show. But how many people watches the show for music? 

To put it simply, Fairy Tail is about a magic guild called ""Fairy Tail"". The story begins when Lucy Heartfilia joins this guild and finds how welcoming, fun, anti-evil, powerful, and loving it is and together, they take on missions, and fights other evil guilds. (does it remind you of a ninja village from some show?) 

Originality is not present in this show. Everything is recycled, reused and replaced from every other shounen presented before. Lacking originality isn't bad, infact many great series weren't as original, but what Fairy Tail lacks is a genuine delivery and attention to details. Clichés can form a decent story if used correctly, however, eveything was thrown out in the stage, ""we must protect"" ""we always win"" ""we are friends"", lengthy dialouges of why friendship is imortant all are thrown out there, and that is what grabs the attention of sleeping audience. There is no form of suspense, everything is predictable, dialouges are from the third-grade diary, protagonists are typical and not to mention the Dragon Ball complex, you know, fight enemy then make them friends, is present in this shounen too. 

Protagonists are loud, seen as patriots (as every other typical shounen), girls are for some unknown reasons portrayed as either absurdly strong and obnoxious or extremely helpless, and villains are agian, your recylced evil guys doing things with no ulterior purpose. There wasn't any development but more like a boost change in personality. One time they are bad and next episode, poof, they are good guy. The change is like skipping steps and can't be called development, more like sudden changes to characters. One time the character is weak and the next scene they somehow are the strongest character with power with unsatisfying explanation.

 The most significant things, which applies to most audience, is the character art. Gray stripping, nicely drawn out ""cool"" guys,  and EVERY SINGLE FEMALE has a voluptuous body with exaggerated top. However, you don't see audience complaining, because, there is fan service for both ends, sadly, we are in an era where normal figures are considered ugly and to promote story, shows draw out exaggerated body parts. 

The art, beside that, is fantastic. Details are good, backgrounds are reputable, and the concept of mage and guilds are drawn fairly well. Borders are done well, and there colours are vibrant. Animation for any shounen, as always, is good too. 

Fairy Tail had a little potential. Perhaps some fixing of plot, presenting some unique character could've enhanced the enjoyment. However, the show borrows so much from other shounen that you can't remember anything significant of it, beside the music. As someone who have seen One Piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball and some other major shounen, the similarity and lack of orginality is too obvious to enjoy. There are even major characters (Gildarts), stroy arcs that were completely taken from other series and inserted in this show, with minor changes. 

Overall, I respect Hiro Mashima's ability to draw fast and draw some good scenes, but when it comes to plot I pity these pathetic plots and characters. From my perspective, Fairy Tail is like those action anime with super fan-service, except there is no nudity, but exaggerated males and females with the given explanation for fighting ends with ""cuz we b frndz"" 

If you're into beautiul females, typical shounen, and are half-wake when watching shows, this is definitely your anime, If you want something serious, deep, and a thrilling shounen, you may run away before wasting any time.

To conclude, Fairy Tail left a bitter scar in my heart. I have wasted one summer, looking for change, unfortunately, it was pathetic."

Not that it ended badly, it just sucks that it ended at all. 

Fairy Tail is, for lack of a better term, your generic shounen. You have a group of teenage wizards running around fighting bad guys and all the while they get stronger as Natsu Dragneel looks for his father… who is a dragon. Shounen clichés come with the territory, and Fairy Tail is no exception. Think about it. If you make a shounen, no matter how you make it, it is going to have some generic components. What makes Fairy Tail so unique is that it is
                  ...
good in spite of all the clichés the plot may have. 

You have to remember something that so many people easily forget. Not every part of a generic shounen is bad, and Fairy Tail actually does a really good job capitalizing on the things we love in a shounen. It has great humor, consistent arcs, short recaps, nice fight scenes, and most importantly nice character development. 

The members of the Fairy Tail guild are an interesting bunch to say the least. Since they can all use magic their fighting styles are extremely diverse. After the first season you will feel like you know the members of the guild personally. There are dozens you are introduced to and you will most likely remember their names because the show does that good of a job at giving the characters a long lasting impression. When something happens to one of the members of the guild it will probably make you sad, maybe even bring on some tears. You won’t even realize you have an emotional attachment to these characters until something happens. It is almost as if you are blind-sided a bit by the connection you have with the Fairy Tail guild members, and you will most definitely have a connection with the members as you will most likely see yourself in one of them. I guess it doesn’t hurt that this anime had an all-star voice cast to help with making you like the characters. 

That’s right; you’ll definitely recognize at least a few of the voices in this anime. The first one that I noticed was the voice of Toradora’s Aisaka Taiga, but the show itself has many more notable voices than that including Alphonse Elric, Hanekawa Tsubasa, Miki Sayaka, and Amane Misa. A voice cast like Fairy Tail’s does not come around often and is something that must be acknowledged when going into this anime. Not only does the show have an all-star voice cast but the score for the show is also pretty over the top. Normally it would be hard for a show to get the soundtrack just right but Fairy Tail managed to do it extremely well. 

The art and animation should really go without saying. It is extremely well done, and fluid allowing for really awesome fights to be had. The style of the art is a little strange though, and not unlike One Piece it may put some people off at first, but after a few episodes you will find yourself really loving the art, just as you will find yourself loving the anime as a whole. 

I myself really love Fairy Tail. I love the jokes that I used to see, the characters that I got so attached to, the fight scenes, the soundtrack, the art, and you know what? I even love all the generic shounen aspects that came with it. If I had to describe the show in exactly five words I’d tell you “Fairy Tail is really fun.” Because it is, it is just plain fun to watch. 

That’s why I’m sad that it had to end. 
I didn’t want it to have to end.

                                      (20/175 eps)","I'm going to be continually updating this review as the show continues. Currently, I've seen 20 episodes of Fairy Tail and I'm extremely pleased to say that they've upped the artwork and animation. In the first few epi's, things felt a bit below par, animation was re-used in some fight sequences, and overall gave you the feeling of a resounding ""meh."" Over the last few episodes, Fairy Tail's animation, it's soundtrack, and it's storyline have all truly begun. Character introductions are over, and the true Fairy Tail of the manga is showing through. All I can say is watch until episode 13 (a half series
                  ...
worth) and if you're still completely unsatisfied with Fairy Tail, then drop it. But keep in mind, this is a shounen anime, and sometimes the beginning is nothing like the show, or simply lacking.

Story:

Fairy Tail appears to follow Lucy, a Stellar Spirit Mage, and Natsu, A fire breathing/punching/kicking/eating mage who is on a search for his old master Igneel. As the story goes on however, the focus shifts and really embodies all the characters. If you were to compare Fairy Tail's story to any other anime it would be One Piece, as the general theme of adventure, nakama, comedy and climax is there, not to mention the definite similarities between Natsu and Luffy. Overall, Fairy Tail's story is a classic shounen type, but from what they've done in the manga, and how the anime is so far sizing up, Fairy Tail is sticking to it's story, without throwing in unnecessary filler (not just episodes, but the time spent in episodes). The problem with the story section, is that it can be somewhat hard to get into off the bat, but once Fairy Tail enters it's first true story arc, I can almost guarantee if you're a fan of shounen, you'll love it.

Art:

The one big complaint that comes to mind as someone who has read the manga, is the magic. They've gone with this whole ""summoning circle"" approach, and though I suppose I'm getting used to it, I still know it would be better without. Now, most pilot episodes have sketchy animation. And Fairy Tail is no exception. But what I was extremely pleased to see (while watching the series) is that the animation budget seems to have kicked it into high gear upon the first story arc, and animation quality is not top notch. Don't let the first few epi's fool you, the animation in Fairy Tail is actually pretty good.

Sound:

The background music does a nice job actually, it's upbeat and helps you get a feeling for the mood in general, cause when they drop the flutes, you know something's going down. This is something more recent, but for the first time in Fairy Tail I felt a real union of plot, character and background music to truly bring together a scene. It was powerful, it was invigorating, and very encouraging. Watching the show it feels like it's on a learning curve, starting from episode 1-13. 1-3 it's getting C's in school, 4-9 it's picked up to a B-, 10-12 It's rocketed up to A-, and by 14 I'm seeing real quality work come from Fairy Tail in all aspects. Honestly, if you've dropped this series, I need to say give it another chance and continue watching.

Character:

Fairy Tail's Character scene is diffiult to sum up. I'll start off by saying, they don't do a great job of introducing them. They just bring most of them in, and expect you to like them. And it doesn't really work.  Everyone just comes off as being uninteresting or stale at first. But as the show goes on, the characters were developed, and you can start to enjoy them. (This happens around ep. 11-14). After that, you can begin to really appreciate Fairy Tail as the manga has been built up to be. It's running on 160+ chapters, the story's got no problem going for it, you might just have to trust me that the characters start out shallow, but build into being lovable.

Enjoyment:

Here's where Fairy Tail gets it's points. Once the cast is introduced you get into the story and it's a captivating tail (see what I did there? ;D). I find myself laughing at Happy's antics, Lucy's misfortunes and Natsu and Gray's relationship/overall attitude. The fight scenes are interesting and eye catching, and the story is fun to follow. Fortunately 161 chapters in, and I've yet to see Fairy Tail's story turn for the worse, like many shounen manga/anime fall victim to. So here's looking forward to an anime that can go strong for years to come.

Overall:

I give Fairy Tail a 9. The story is solid, and it's very enjoyable, and that's really all you can ask. If you want to complain about art, sound, and character, all I have to say is keep watching. My old review said ""you'll just have to trust me that things will get better"" and I'm glad to see that that premonition came to pass. In my opinion, an anime is all about how much you enjoy it, and Fairy Tail is one to enjoy."

                                      (5/175 eps)","I had heard of a legendary manga called Fairy Tail, and when an anime version of it was announced, I was really happy.  I wanted to watch a mainstream shounen (as in.. Bleach, Naruto, One Piece) from the very beginning, since those three aforementioned series have way too many episode for me to catch up on, anyway.

I was sorely disappointed.


==[Pros]==

- Great idea.  The setting is very imaginative... but that's to be expected when you're dealing with a series like this.

- Music.  The ED is very catchy, and the OP isn't bad.
...


==[Cons]==

- Characters.  They are static.  Very static.  To the point where I wouldn't be surprised if they could make an appearance in Zetsubou Sensei's class of stereotyped characters.  Gray is just ""rival of main character with running gag.""  That's all we know about him after five episodes.

- The pacing.  Introductory episodes are usually used to flesh out characters.  The four introductory episodes here are totally pointless.  The characters are just the same people we see in episode one.  I found myself asking ""why?"" to every episode.  There's no reason why these episodes should even exist.

- The animation.  Look at the ground beneath Natsu's feet in the opening sequence.  Bad art and animation is sprinkled everywhere.


==[Conclusion]==
Good concept, but the static characters, mediocre animation, and nearly episodic way to storytelling make for a slow (five epiosdes) and useless introduction that makes me not want to watch any more."

Reasons why it gets worse:
The arcs are very predictable and similar.
The female characters lose more clothing as it continues.
The gags are overly done.
The main character doesn't train to get stronger they suddenly get stronger in the middle of a fight.
Happy doesn't say ""Aye Sir"" anymore.(big reason, unforgivable)

I now have to take monthly breaks in between of individual episodes so that I can convince myself that the next episode wont be as bad as the last.

Story: 1/10

If this section of the review is a mess it is because there is no way in words to describe how horrifically bad fairy tails story is and I have therefore just ranted for a while about how bad it is as well as I could.

Imagine if nobody
                  ...
ever died even the bad guys. Does that sound like an interesting story with high stakes? This is what Fairy tail is. Not only that but every villain seems to have a change of heart and become good or just comes back to be defeated again. Death is something acknowledged as happening in the past yet literally nobody seems capable of being killed from blows that should destroy entire cities.

There is no plot development, a horrific seven year skip, an overarching story that disappoints at every turn, so much bad filler, people recover strength from fucking friendship in every fight etc.

This anime has got to the point where each horrifically short story arc is incredibly easy to predict. The story never changes it is just on a constant loop in which the heros lose then get motivated and come back to win.

Art: 4/10

The art has its ups and downs (more downs) but is what you would expect from an anime of this size. I have never been disappointed with the art but it has never excited me either.

Sound: 7/10

This anime is made watchable only by its well voiced characters, good sound effects and great music. I still listen to some of this anime's music despite the horrific memories it gives me.

Characters: 5/10

The pros of the characters are that they are well designed and all have their own interesting distinct powers. If this anime had been good then I would have been very pleased with the cool way magic is portrayed in such variety.

The cons of the characters is that they NEVER FUCKING DIE. Literally every character is invincible there are no stakes. They also reintroduce characters that should be long dead and make previous story arcs even more pointless.   More characters are added at such a rate and bad guys convert to good so fast that there are now hundreds of main characters.

Overall: 3/10

I'm being generous here when I say this"

                                      (1/175 eps)","*THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FIRST EPISODE*

Lucy is a young wizard who wants to join the magic guild Fairy Tail. During her travels she meets Natsu, a fellow wizard, and his mascot pet Happy. Together they travel the world and get into lots of fights, presumably, in her quest to join Fairy Tail. This is, after all, a shonen series, so that's to be expected.

The characters are standard fair for the genre: plucky, but slightly air-headed, girl, awesome fighter guy who's also an idiot, and a cute mascot pet that explains everything to the air-headed girl. Really nothing here to make them stand out
                  ...
from any of the other series from this genre.

Outside of the CG from Bantorra, this is probably the cheapest and blandest animation I've seen in the Fall '09. It's flat, has a low framerate, and minimal movements. Background characters are embarrassingly undetailed. Spell effects are mainly just some CG plastered on the screen.

It doesn't really help that everything Fairy Tail does has been done before and better by a lot of other shows like One Piece or Rave Master. 

 The only real saving grace of the first episode is that it has a smattering of genuinely funny moments and some nice looking backgrounds in a few place.

'Bland' is the word for this series. Art is bland, animation is bland, story is bland, characters are bland. Inoffensive, but tasteless.

I guess if you really, really like these sorts of shows [shounen] then you might enjoy Fairy Tail, otherwise you can probably avoid it and not feel as though you're missing out on anything."

I’ve heard of an anime called Fairy Tail becoming part of the legendary animes out there. I've watched it, and to my surprise it’s not good as I expected it to be.

Art:7
Well to be honest, I really don’t pay attention to the art when it comes to anime. I think anything goes well. However, compared to other animes out there, it has a good artistic look.  Very cartoony and joyful feeling.

Music:7
It actually has very good music. The soundtrack is epic, sounds like medieval time music, and its good. It also has a lot of classical music, like Can-Can, Pomp and
                  ...
Circumstance,  A on a G string, and a lot more.  

Characters:4
I’ve seen a lot of Shounen animes, and well this is your typical characters you find in an anime. Natsu is your average energetic guy who loves eating, and always pumped up when going into battle.  Similar to Naruto and Luffy. Lucy is also your average wacky girl who is very clumsy and not very powerful.  Yet she has a very nice body, like the rest of the girls in Fairy Tail. Gray and Natsu are always competing about power and constantly fighting  with each other.  Finally, Erza is like the babysitter in the group; she is serious, strong, and intelligent.  In other words, the characters are not really that unique. 

Story:5
This anime is about this teenage girl names Lucy Heartfilia whose goal is to become a great mage. On her way, she meets this boy about her age named Natsu Dragneel , and Natsu invites her to be a member of Fairy Tail. In there, they form a group along with Gray, Natsu’s friend/enemy, Happy, Natsu’s pet, and Erza. All 5 do jobs in Fairy Tail in order to earn money.  Its not a very unique or exciting storyline. When fighting, Natsu ‘natually’ gets to fight with the final boss, and wins epictly, like in a typical Shounen anime. 

Enjoyment:6
I have to be honest, but the anime does have a lot of humorous scenes. The gang is always fooling around, Lucy always wants to get guys attention but fails,  Natsu and Gray are always fighting, Happy always thinks about fish and says the most hilarious stuff, and much other things.  Inside the guild is a joyous feeling. However, this is not the reason I don’t like it. When it comes to fighting, the battles are always predictable.  Natsu always fights the boss, and wins naturally. Also the good guys always win no matter what.  If everyone is in peril, they somehow win by an ultimate attack, or something miraculously happens.  In other words, its dull. The battles are not epic or fun to watch.  Additionally, not a lot of deaths occur. Everyone always survives to be good and dandy.  Not much blood is spilled either.

Overall, I give it a 5. It isn’t exciting and so typical.  The storyline is typical, the characters are common, fights are dull and predictable. A lot of people seem to like it because of the humor and cause it has a joyous environment.  I like humor, but not all the time."

                                      (Unknown/175 eps)","When I first picked up Fairy Tail, I had heard much hype from friends -- that it would pose a challenge to the big four kings of shonen anime, e.g. Naruto/Bleach/One Piece/Fullmetal Alchemist. After watching the first few episodes, I could not decide whether I hated it or loved it. I gave it a 6 for many reasons, but I personally have started to follow it and hope it develops.

Story: 8

The story is one of interesting concept, not over-done in anime right now: a world of magicians and wizards, where everyone has the ability to do some form of magic. At the start, I was
                  ...
confused whether Fairy Tail was a shonen or a shojo.  We start off with an adorable, innocent looking girl aspiring to become a great wizard. Each wizard belongs to a guild, sort of an organization that gathers people together as allies (think Squad in Bleach, Hidden Village in Naruto, or crew in One Piece, etc.). 
The story progresses as you are set up with your protagonists being very under developed but having an interesting(at first) plot. Lucy, the main character, is the aspiring girl who was thrust into the guild Fairy Tail. She is quickly taken under Natsu's wing, one of the strongest wizards in Fairy Tail. Of course, given this, Natsu is incredibly powerful and can wipe the floor with any normal opponent, reminiscent of Bleach's Ichigo and his godlike powers. Other equally-god-like characters are introduced to create what attempt to be fair battle sequences, but fail as it is obvious through some ""I-WIN"" method that Natsu and Lucy are always going to win. The one redeeming factor of the story is the little change found in Lucy as well as the occasional good moral or funny scene.

Art: 5

The art almost made my eyes bleed. It was so blatantly attempting to fanservice people it almost made me cringe. The art would go from intense battle sequences, with at least some effort put it, to some low quality form of joke with little to no imagination. The art seemed mediocre at best, being bested by many 90s anime(see: Rurouni Kenshin / DBZ). While older anime may not have been as ""clean"" as a new one like Fairy Tail, the art is clearly sloppy and the episodes made to be a cash cow.

Sound: 6.5

Sound is a decent factor in this. None of the tracks are memorable (see: Lena Park's rendition of ""You Raise Me Up,"" found in Romeo X Juliet). It can be fitting at times, and the OP and ED are not too bad. It looks as though the creators of Fairy Tail actually tried to find some appropriate music and settings, though it cannot save the anime.

Character: 5

Static. Static static static bland boring static. You are introduced to the main few characters within the first two or three episodes, and then from there, besides Lucy, there is no development. Each of the characters has some rivalry or funny quirk that attempts to make them seem less Mary Sue, but basically all of the characters short of Lucy are godly powerful and make others worship them. The one aforementioned, Natsu, was trained by a dragon and can utilize fire to deadly possibilities. The line is even said that he could reduce an entire city to rubble...which implies how incredibly unbalanced it seems. Likewise, the characters seem to jump in power from average to within seconds godlike, having a decent battle sequence followed by an overly-powered God-like maneuver performed by a protagonist. The only worthwhile watch here is that of Lucy, who seems to progress and gain some depth.

Enjoyment: 6.5

For the first two episodes, I was IM'ing a friend saying ""This can't be a legit anime. It's like Fruits Basket and One Piece had a baby which was then hit over the head with a waffle iron."" But the anime slowly grew on me, regardless of the low quality of animation, lack of character development, or general idea of plot. Being such a shonen sucker, I keep watching Fairy Tail hoping it can at least turn out to be something similar to One Piece, Bleach, or Naruto -- something at least watchable. For the new viewer of anime, it is a good easer into the more intense stuff, but overall I would give this anime a 6.5 / 10, solely for its lack of effort, when it was hyped to be a very good anime and manga."

Anyway, let me say that I started watching Fairy Tail by mere curiosity. I had never heard of if at the time, but the Freeze fansubs, group that was doing Dragon Ball Kai (as I big fan of the DB series of course I watched it)  had it among its projects and it caught my eye. There were only about 30 episodes or so released and I thought that if the
                  ...
group thought of if to be a good series to work on, that I should give it a try. At first I was skeptical because I never really liked fantasy animes that had magic involved, and from the little research I made around the web, Fairy Tail was just a clone of One Piece (a series that I have yet to watch - too much to catch up with). Yet, after a handful of episodes it had me grabbed. It was a very nice surprise. I had finally found a typical shounen series that really satisfied me. Obviously, after catching up with the anime I started on the manga and kept following both ever since.  But long story aside, let's go to the actual review of the anime, shall we?

Story - 8

I won't lie, there is nothing of really new and innovating about Fairy Tail story wise. It's your typical shounen anime and all the clichès that the genre entails. It portraits the adventures of your typical carefree  shounen hero and his group of friends. The main theme of Fairy Tail is of course, friendship, and therefore good always triumph over evil, not because the good guys are stronger, but because the good guys have friends who support them and that protect each other. As I said, nothing new here. If there is something that may, or may not be kind of new, is that we are not exactly sure who the main character is. At first glance you say, Natsu. He's the strong, cheerful guy with cool powers - the obvious choice. But soon you notice that it's the heroine, Lucy, who's in charge of introducing the story to us, and she's often the center of the story. I find that very refreshing. 
The story arcs follow the manga faithfully, and throughout them we are presented with a bit of everything: drama, humor, bits of romance  and of course lots of fighting and cool powers, everything in the right doses and well timed. The often dreaded fillers are rare, and when present don't really disappoint, keeping the same spirit of the series and not interfering with the flow of the main story. 
One could say that the story is one of the weakest points of Fairy Tail. Yet it is far from being bad. It's the opposite actually. It's simple, straightforward but interesting enough to keep you hooked and far from being bored. You don't need to pay extra attention to be able to follow the plot. Most events are predictable in all good shounen style, but at the same time you won't be able to figure out the story's biggest mysteries until the due time comes.

So while it is true that there is nothing of really outstanding about the story of Fairy Tail, there is nothing of wrong about it either.  


Art - 7

Fairy Tail's art is in my opinion the weakest point of the show. There is nothing   about it that stands out, neither good or bad. Everything is as expected in a long ongoing series such as this. The animation can vary from fairy decent to something more blend and flat at times. But at least in key scenes of the story the anime staff seems to put extra effort in the art and its animation.  
All in all, even if the art in Fairy Tail is not anything worth of jaw-dropping awe, it is good enough not to make you cringe. It's on the same quality level of any other long series anime show currently airing. 


Sound - 9

I'm giving 9/10 mostly because of the OST (background music). I may not understand much about music, if it's well composed or not, if it's rich or not, but I just know I like what I hear. The music always suits very well the moment which is playing, being varied enough to suit whatever moment is playing. The music has a particular significance during emotional scenes. It helps conveying the feelings of the characters. 
The sound effects are neither bad or good. Most of the times you don't really notice them. But that's a good thing. It means they are well timed and serve their purpose. But there is one sound in particular that I particularly like. I call it the ""ecchi"" sound. It that little ""ahhhh"" you hear in every scene where there is any sexual reference. It's hilarious really. It's not unique to Fairy Tail, but it's in this anime that I've seen it being used better. 
The voice actors also seem to know what they are doing pretty well. All characters sound  good and befitting of their personalities. i would say the cast was perfectly chosen and they make such a good job that you tend to forget that what you are seeing and watching are animated characters.
The opening and ending songs are nice too. I personally prefer the ending songs mostly because they are usually more on the slow side. But the openings songs always have that hype that really say ""look, this anime is cool and very fun to watch"" .


Characters - 9

Here is one of the points that I think Fairy Tail has of best. There is good number of characters, suitable for all kinds of tastes, all of them interesting and likable, both main characters and supporting characters. Every single character is unique in their own way. It's normal to have one character or two that you like best, but in Fairy Tail you will find yourself having trouble electing one. They are all so cool and/or funny. Throughout the series most of them have a good share of development an focus. Even minor characters are important. Even if they don't do much by themselves, they are an important part of the whole.   
As I mentioned earlier, it's not easy to define who the protagonist of the show is. I guess we can talk about a main group instead of a particular character. Which, in my modest opinion, is a good thing. I get tired of anime of this same genre that talk about how important is to work as a team but that in the end everything is put in the hands of one main character while the others stay in the sidelines, being useless or getting in the way.
There is another thing that I really like about Fairy Tail characters - the female characters are not there just for fan service. Most of them are strong and can put the male characters to shame. 

Enjoyment - 10

I'm giving such a high note to 'Enjoyment"" because in all sincerity, Fairy Tail is, above all, fun to watch. There have been several occasions where I was brought to tears, both from laughing or from getting emotional. And Fairy Tail does a good job at balancing all those good and happy emotions with the sad and bittersweet ones. It's curious how you will find yourself laughing even when the characters are at a particularly difficult situation. It wouldn't go as far as calling it comic relief though. Comic relief usually is only present in between ""heavier"" scenes or when a particular character is present. But in Fairy Tail it looks like every moment is a moment of comic relief. 
It's not just the comedy that is enjoyable though. As any good shounen, Fairy Tail provides laughs and tears. And although most of the fights are resolved quickly [that's right, in FT fights aren't dragged on forever] you will feel ""pumped up"" even after they are finished. 
All in all, Fairy Tail has a happy vibe about it that will put a smile on your face every time you watch it. 


Overall - 9 

Fairy Tail is not the perfect anime masterpiece, not at all. It has its flaws and its qualities like any other anime.  But if you let yourself go with the flow you will find yourself really enjoying it, independently if this is your kind of show or not. I highly recommend you try it. I'm convinced you will not be disappointed."

                                      (124/175 eps)","Story: 5 (Mediocre)
Fairy Tail is a shounen anime that revolves around a Mage Guild called 'Fairy Tail'. Each arc in the anime revolves around 4 main characters; Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Gray.

The first few arcs in the show have varying plots that slowly unravel these characters' pasts. Later arcs have plots related more-so to the guild's history, but the show never fails to ruin a good plot with the addition of random bad guys used purely for battle-scenes, so characters can power up with the power of friendship. yay. 


Another downfall to the story of Fairy Tail is that is had no direction it is
                  ...
moving in. Okay, so Natsu has his ultimate goal to find his trainer and guardian Igneel -  the dragon that raised him and taught him Dragon Slayer magic - but the anime is over 150 episodes long and we haven't seen even the slightest trace of a dragon. 

Art: 6 (Fair)
The art and animation are also very average, but they do increase in quality as the show progresses. The show is a very colourful and vibrant one, with settings that are always very visually appealing, and characters that have nice attire and yes, the good ol' anime hairstyles we've all come to kow and love.

The reason I gave the Art category a 6 is because the animation of characters is hardly ever fluid, even in fight scenes, the frame rate skips, the punches aren't actually punching, they are just posing in front of diagonal lines... It's just, for an anime that has so much fighting, I expect good quality animation, and it's simply not there (don't get me wrong, there are some good fights, but they are scarce).

Sound: 9 (Great)
Finally, something Fairy Tail has that I find are lacking in other shounens; a good soundtrack!

I believe there are three soundtracks released to date and they are what make the many prevalent fight scenes so damn epic. I would not have watched Fairy Tail past the first few arcs if there wasn't some awesome electric guitar riff going on while Natsu was punching his way to victory. 

Characters: 5 (Mediocre)
The story and the characters are a crucial part of a shounen, and should come second to nothing. The main characters in Fairy Tale are given a whole lot of backstory, terrible pasts, shock twists etc etc.
Most character's pasts are cliche and overly dramatic, and these only apply to our main 4 protagonists, and a few side characters (The Elfman, Lisanna, Mirajane trio for example).

Another downfall for characters is that they remain very static throughout the show, and hardly ever budge from their niche. What I mean by this is that every character's past defines who they are in the show, and who they pretty much always will be. There are no moments in the show that change the characters behaviour hardly at all, and I find that very unfortunate.

Enjoyment: 7 (Good)
Obviously there was something that made me gat over 100 episodes into this show. That my friends, was purely because I enjoyed myself.

The comedy in the show is a major highlight, with crazy characters, funny one-liners and silly situations all mixed into one another to make us laugh and smile. And that's what Fairy Tail is; it's fun! Sure it is serious when it needs to be, but you can always count on someone to brighten up the mood almost instantly.

Overall: 6 (Fair)
Okay, so there's the final verdict; a solid 6. Fairy Tail is a shounen anime that shines in its comedy, its soundtrack and a few decent fights along the way, but it lacks in unique and original story and plot, character development, and animation at times. 

If you are just starting off on anime, its a great gateway anime, but if you're a seasoned anime fan, there are better shounens out there, and there are better comedic shows out there, so its not really worth the length the show goes for (with no end in sight as of yet)."

The story in the manga is good, this first episode followed the manga carefully. The manga contains some good arcs but also some bad arcs (in my opinion). It will probably a 100+ ep. series. 


The art is similar to one piece. I didnt think it was bad, but the spell casting could have been better. I expected a bit more from that, but I will get used to it.

The sound was good. I liked the background music, it fits this anime, the opening was
                  ...
weird, but perfect. 
Voice acting could have been better, I expected Natsu to have a less mature voice and Happy to have a less girly voice but again, I will get used to it. The voice acting of Lucy is ok.

The manga contains some cool characters, Natsu is a typical Naruto/ Black star, but he is still funny. It contains some other cool characters but I wont tell u about them.

Im sure you will enjoy this series, but probably not as much as the manga. If u like shonen with a sense of humor, Fairy Tail is the anime u should watch."

                                      (40/175 eps)","Every once in a while you make a damning mistake. A mistake so profound you feel nothing but deep regret for yourself. After reading perhaps a thousand reviews on MAL, I knew I had to avoid this sizzling pile of mess like the plague, however I decided to see what made this nausea inducing anime so popular and I learnt what I already knew.

Popularity doesn't make something good.

Obvious isn't it? But curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see it. What followed was torture so gruesome I bet even a guy from the middle ages couldn't fathom such excruciating stuff. Maybe I
                  ...
was paying for the sins I paid. Heck even all the sins committed by my ancestors wouldn't compare anything to what I went through. If there is one thing I absolutely  hate, its boredom. Fairy tail didn't bore me. It left me a gibberish wreck. There is a certain limit to how much you can recycle stuff. If we had been recycling like this in real life the Earth would be restored to its real glory. But can someone restore the time I wasted watching this harrowing anime on Animax?

No

Time is precious. There are million things you can do in your life. Don't waste it on watching fairy tail. Let me tell you why you shouldn't even touch this anime with a 10 feet long stick

1) No plot. Every anime cannot be Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, however that doesn't mean it has to be totally brain dead with nothing resembling a story. If someone ever tells you that Fairy Tail has a good story, pull out a bazooka and shoot him dead on the spot. He was sent by hell itself to mislead you. 

2) Fan service. I watch anime to listen to a good story. See characters which amaze me. Listen to music which gets me peppy. Not large chested females who somehow live with body proportions only a magazine publisher could digest. I am amazed how shameless this anime gets every time I see it.

3) Characters - We had Dragon ball Z before. It had glorious men who fought for the Earth for peace. They were men you wanted to be. Full of courage bravado and daring. What do we have here? An annoying hero who tries to act too cool despite himself. A female lead who apparently puts silicon in her chest every episode. A red haired female called Erza who doesn't have something even resembling a personality. And a guy called Gray who you would probably discard without even looking at him. Just his sound annoys me.

4) Friendship- Its 4v4 between the good guys and the bad guys. Only one good guy remains standing. Now its 1v4. Our hero is outmatched.Can anything save him? Lets see. A boost up in energy perhaps? Some rage induced power? Clever tactics? No mon ami, you are mistaken. The power of friendship will descent from heaven, bringing *sparkly* light and help our hero do things he couldn't do  if you had given him a cocktail of redbull, Chilean coffee, strawberry milkshake and cocaine. This anime is bullshit that's my point.

So if you want to feel a universal shattering kick on your nuts or brain hemorrhage  watch some fairy tail.


No seriously don't."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Fairy Tail falls under the same category as many of the most popular anime in existence, namely One Piece, Bleach and Naruto, and because the shounen genre is never exactly rich in story or character depth, ive decided to be fair and rate this anime for what it is rather than comparing it to the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate, so please enjoy!

In a world where magic is part of everybody's daily life, we follow the story of Lucy Heartfilia; an aspiring wizard who-after meeting Natsu Dragneel- becomes a member of the wizard guild known as Fairy Tail.
Seems pretty basic right? Well the story
                  ...
doesn't get much more complex than thet until later on, which gives the viewer time to get attached to the characters and for the story itself to put all of the pieces in place ready for the last 20 or so episodes.
The show is divided up into around 13 arcs, with the last episode of each arc having some form of impact on the Fairy Tail Guild that will be used as a plot point much later on.
The art is really well done, but repetitive, the most noticeable of which are Erza's transformation, Lucy's gate calling and Natsu's Fire Dragon Powers, but   eventually you become used to them and they dont become painful to watch.
the battles are also amazing to watch, which comes as no suprise considering this genre of anime iare the masters at long, drawn out yet visually impressive battles, and last but not least, most of the character designs are also very creative and well drawn, with the female characters being adorable and the male characters looking like the typical strong hero.

When it comes to the sound, and most importantly , the sub and dub of the show, i really have no complaints; Todd Haberkorn (well known for playing Death the Kid in Soul Eater) does a brilliant job at nailing Natsu's fiesty but caring personality to a T and other heavy hitters such as Monica Rial playing the gorgeous Mirajane also do a fine job at nailing Mira's cutesy but serious personality, the japanese script was written to appeal to a slightly older audience than the american dub, with swearing and a much more aggressive tone added to Natsu and Erza, yet they seem to be missing or rewritten in the english dub to appeal to a much younger audience. I cant leave behind this part of the review without talking about Aya Hirano, who often worries me because when i hear her voice i think of so many other characters over the character she's trying to play, but for some reason i was able to look past that this time and can confidently say that she too does a really good job of turning Lucy into a damsel in distress character thats fully equipped with a fiery personality.

The character is where things start to get more complicated though, as, individually MOST of the characters have been given their own backstory and are well fleshed out, but when it comes to character relationships, things begin to slowly roll down hill.
The show makes it blatantly obvious that characters are romantically interested with others, yet throughout all 175 episodes, nothing is done about it until the very last few episodes of the entire series; and even then nothing is resolved, only hinted at.
Back onto the subject of the story arcs, some are incredibly fun to watch but some become incredibly tedious after a while, thats because every arc follows the same formula;
-MC gets beat up by villain  
-Villain does something to MCs friends
-MC uses the power of friendship to overthrow the villain
-Villain get their ass whooped back to the stone age

This runs the risk of a person's enjoyment of the series to become very stale and thus people begin to drop the series, made worse by the fact that the best arcs are much later on (Edolas Arc starts on episode 76, Tenrou Island Arc starts on episode 96 and the grand Magic Games arc starts episode 150)
this is a real problem if a show takes 75 episodes to really get going, aend thus enjoyment of the show will vary from person to person, but dont worry, its not like the series BEFORE episode 76 isnt good, its just doesnt really progress the plot.

On the whole, i really enjoyed watching this show, despite a pretty shaky start and a couple arcs that get kind of boring after a certain point, what you have here is 175 episodes of pure mindless fun and because it knows what it is, everything works brilliantly, my only problem comes with the cliffhanger ending, yes after 175 episodes the story STILL hasnt finished, luckily its re-airing in April, but it upset me that they didnt even finish the story arc."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"Fairy Tail was the first anime I had ever seen and when I look back to it, I have to say it was a great gateway to the world of anime. But that is about it. The main building blocks of any anime, plot & character could have been executed a lot – when I say a lot I really mean a lot, better. 

The plot is quickly summarised as generic. The main team of characters, Natsu, Lucy, Gray and Erza come across some evil activity that has to be stopped. They are later joined by Gajeel and Wendy. When they find out who is
                  ...
behind this evil activity they have to stop them, by beating them. The first round they get beaten, but then the group will summon the bonds of nakama’s or the willpower of Natsu will be found and he beats the people who do this certain evil activity. End of story, repeat.
I fear that I have summed up and summarised every arc, including the fillers. The repetitious plot is also accompanied by jokes that get old very fast, like Natsu’s and any other Dragon slayers vehicle sickness. 

Outside that the characters are flat, to the extremes. They are cliché stereotypes. It is defanatly not a good sign if you can summarize the characters in one word. You have the rival Gray, the over manly man Elfman, the pervert Makarov, the fangirl Juvia, the OP main character Natsu, the Damsel-in-distress Lucy, just to name a few. It also has inconsistencies, where Natsu at first is shown to the viewer as an user of an extremely rare kind of magic. Later you find out that there are three generations of Dragon slayers. So it is not that special after all. 
The thing I dislike most about this show is that the story revolves around Lucy, but she rarely gets any screen time compared to Natsu. I sometimes wonder; “Why do these things always happen to Lucy?’ to then be reminded again, ‘Oh yeah!, she is the main character’. This is easily forgotten because of the immense emphasis put on Natsu.

The art however is not bad at all. The animations of magic are well executed and the characters look appealing to the eye. The art is solid, just like the sound. The voice acing was alright and Fairy Tail did have quite a few good OST’s.

Overall, I would say that Fairy Tail is a great gateway to the wonderful world of anime, but other than that, it is not worthy of being watched. If you had quite the history of anime that you have watched, I would suggest that you skip this show. The art and sound are the only real upsides of this anime."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"After watching 175 episodes (minus the potentially suicidal filler arcs) of Fairy Tail, I have come to the conclusion that a total of 3,500 minutes ( roughly translated to 58 HOURS and 20 MINUTES) has been completely and utterly wasted on this horrible excuse of an anime. And in case you're wondering, I am going easy on this since it's a shonen, hell those 3 points are me being MERCIFUL.

 This will be a full in-depth analysis to try to understand what exactly makes this show so bad. I will try not to mention ""nakama power boosts"" and ""unkillable characters"" as most people think that's
                  ...
whats wrong with the show. However, there are many more glaring problems that must be recognized before stuff like ""nakama power boosts"". Strap on your googles, Pick up  your shovels and join me as we shovel to the heart (rectum) of Fairy Tail to decide which shit is better than that shit. Understand? No? Welcome to Fairy Tail. Let's Begin.

THE GOOD
The number of things that are good in Fairy Tail are limited but I will mention the few that are so I don't sound biased.
The first thing that comes to mind is it's great soundtrack. Fairy Tail's soundtrack is both incredibly beautiful and emotional at times, dramatic and even badass at times. I really love it's Celtic styled theme song as it suits the show perfectly. All of it's openings are all great. A few of the abilities in the show like Erza's Requip are unique and fun to watch. Hmmm...that's kind of all really, I mean...Happy's funny, I guess?

THE BAD
1. LACK OF ORIGINALITY
A show needs to offer something that's unique and creative. Something they won't find in any other show. In One Piece there's a daring pirate world, In Bleach there's a haunting afterlife world and In Naruto there's a ninja world. Each of these are different in their own right and that's what makes them so successful. Now, take a look at Fairy Tail. Nothing stands out in fact everything just feels like a rehash of stuff that's already been done in OP, Bleach and Naruto. In fact, look at all the similarities between One Piece and Fairy Tail. The show blatantly copies it's art style and themes. Just take a look at how much Natsu is similar to Luffy.

 It's world feels empty and soulless outside of it's guild, which shows how poor it's landscape and world building are. If there was one thing that the show attempts to do differently, it's romance. By romance, I mean ""shipping"". Don't know what that means? It translates to ""a never ending romance that never truly begins but is based purely on MAYBE"". Unfortunately, this has also been done time and time again. It's a neat trick that the writer came up with to keep you from escaping this nightmare. TIP TRICK: Listen up, guys. My gone off broccoli is more likely to get with Lucy than that stupid ass pink haired retard. If they ever do get together, I can guarantee it will be only at the VERY END to keep all you fan girls watching.

2.LACK OF OVERALL OBJECTIVE/GOAL
I simply cannot fathom how the show could f*ck THIS up. But surprise, surprise, they did it again. Establishing an overall goal is critical for any anime ESPECIALLY a shonen anime due to their overall length. This is done to prevent people from becoming bored and wondering ""what the f*ck is going on?"" You'd think that the goal would be to find Natsu's dad, which although it's a cliche in itself at least its a clear goal, but nope. Natsu only mentions his ""all important lost father who he hasn't seen in like 10 YEARS"" when he feels like it which is every 50 episodes or when he's not eating something. Because of this each arc feels extremely sloppy and random, and we begin to ask ourselves,""what the f*ck is going on?"". Oh, almost forgot if you thought the story is awful wait till you watch the filler arcs which will break even the strongest will power to their submission. PRO TIP: NEVER EVER even look in the direction of a filler arc. Luffy wants to be the Pirate King= STRAIGHT FORWARD GOAL, Naruto wants to be the greatest Hokage= STRAIGHT FORWARD GOAL.

In a nutshell, it's like taking away the handle bars on a bike. It doesn't have a clear path but it's definitely going somewhere alright. Probably to the soul crushing and tortuous guild know as Fairy Tail.

3. UNRELATABLE/AWFUL CHARACTERS
I suppose you expect me to now go on a rant on how Natsu's character has as much believability as a magical unicorn. I suprisingly don't have many issues with his character. Maybe it's because I had anticipated this type of character or maybe it's because it's been so overdone, Goku/Luffy, that it doesn't bother me anymore. Natsu is a representation of a symbol more than a character. That however, does not excuse the other main characters in the show. Each and every single character is incredibly beautiful and powerful. I think the writer's intention was for Lucy to feel relatable to the viewer? I find this difficult when her first noble act is seduction in order to get a cheaper price. She then eventually becomes OP as f*ck just like everyone else. The only weak character left is Happy. This would be fine if he wasn't a BLUE CAT. Are the writers implying that we mere humans are as useless as blue cats? No, scratch that, we wouldn't survive a blast radius of 200 metres. Only a f*ckin' blue cat could achieve that.

In terms of 'character development' there appears to be some at the start of the series. It starts off with Gray, whose past turns out to be exceptionally boring. Bare in mind this is within the first 20 episodes of the show. Although, development is seen in the arc after it the development just up and vanishes. Character's simply revert to the way they used to be. Character development means it alters there decisions in the FUTURE. They will do things they would never do before. It feels like the writer wants to get their 'development' out of the way. Some characters are given ACTUAL development but they're usually supporting characters like Laxus and Cana. After their time to shine, they simply fade into the background and return to their roles as insanely beautiful and powerful non important characters. Others characters will feel bland and unmemorable. There's also Erza who can win any fight. WHY? Because shes's ERZ-f*ck off.

The characters in Fairy Tail simply look cool but lack in any depth. They all come as stereotypical and unmemorable. When you turn all your characters into unstoppable gods, they will end up feeling unrelatable to the viewer therefore we will not give two sh*ts about them.

4.ANIMATION/FIGHT SCENES
Aside from it's not particularly original art, the main problem with it's animation is it's god awful fight scenes. It's fights are only bad because of two massive reasons. 
 1. NO BLOOD. I'm not asking for gore fests like Hellsing just A LITTLE MOLECULE OF BLOOD so  I can feel like the character is in danger. Like it's just blood? BLOOD? It's a perfectly normal aspect of life and by not introducing it in the show it becomes a 6 year old cartoon.
2.NAKAMA POWER UP
I said I would keep it short so all I'll say is this. When a character has lost 99.999% of the fight , you CANNOT find that 00.001% and add in ""friendship power"" in every single fight. I know other animes do this, but go damnit if Fairy Tail doesn't do it the most."

I prefer more interesting & original story-lines, thrillers, anime with a strong plot and anime with a strong message behind it. Fairy Tail has neither nor any of those qualities.

Even in the manga nothing is know about the true story, things are rather starting to get interesting at the moment, more is still to come.
This is gonna be a long ongoing anime."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Fairy Tail revolves around a mage called Lucy Heartfilia and her guild Fairy Tail, embarking on adventures with themes revolving around friendship and family, to summarise it quickly.
Okay Fairy Tail by any means is not fantastic and quite similarly too many mainstream shonen mangas (naruto, bleach and one piece) had many flaws, ass pull, bad character development and anti-climatic boss battles with the most clichéd main character ever. Let me just say though, I enjoyed the anime immensely whilst watching it but looking back at it, it just got worse and worse.
Story 4/10
The setting was fantastic and a world I would have loved to live
                  ...
in, other than the fact of using magic and fighting, the guild is the essence of how a family should be like. Friends, camaraderie and all the good things about life, the universe and concept was fantastic to say the least.
Although what ruined it was the poorly written or annoying characters and the unnecessary fanservice in it and eventually the lack of care given to the characters. To focus on the plot first is that it repetitive. How? An arc follows this pattern; Job-mini-boss squad- gets owned- then all of a sudden after some motivational speech on friends etc- Natsu beats up the ultimate big bad whilst the rest finish off the mini-squad. It was that simple. Although in its defence, it shares the spotlight around slightly better than other shonen mangas, some other characters also get some pretty big crowning moments of awesome. 
The humour in the anime is also not fantastic, at first it might seem quite amusing but in hindsight now, the latter of the anime relies on fanservice waaaaaay too much for comedic sakes and thus made it slightly unbearable to watch.
Also the ass pull in the anime, with the hope spot after the main character suddenly powers up with some really unbelievable method and an inspirational speech about friends, BAM! Villain gone good guys win with no serious repercussions. For example, one does not simply eat some nuclear rock and then suddenly power-up to defeat a villain who was kicking your ass previously. The motivational speeches were truly quite inspirational towards the start but it was overused so much it became somewhat annoying. Couldn’t they find another way to win a battle? Although it is the main theme of the anime so I guess so slack could be given.
The anime also has a habit of censoring all the blood and making the anime overly fluffy and happy. I understand that it’s supposed to be happy and aimed at children but seriously you cannot go through a fight with a major fight and only come out with minor cuts and bruises, this enforces the unrealistic nature of the anime. Also how the anime just seems to refuse to kill off any characters, instead of giving them an epic death, the author just lets them sit in the background and rot away which I believe no character deserves.
Characters- 6/10
Then the characters in the anime, most of them are poorly developed or overly annoying. First of all being the main lead Lucy, one of the most commonly bashed characters but not to show my bias, I have to agree as well due to the fact that she is useless. Her sole purpose seems to be for fanservice and appealing to male fans, I mean come on; she can’t get through a single fight with her clothing intact. Also the situations she are put in to make her appear stronger and in retrospect to the other lead Erza, her primary purpose is for fanservice and shipping sakes. Perhaps if she was a minor character, I wouldn’t have disliked her that much but the due fact that the arcs revolve around her and she doesn’t do anything annoys me.
Then we have Natsu, your typical hero who has a food obsession, is impulsive and stupid, unbelievably powered and the guy who gives all the motivational speeches. Yeah, really annoying just by the simple fact that he isn’t an original character with virtually no character development throughout the series.
These are the main two character issues but I also have a major issue with the villains. A villain just can’t seem to stay dead or stay gone, they always come back, remember Erigor in one of the first arcs? He appears at least two times later and then you have the members of Oracion Seis who just had to return for a filler arc and don’t get me started on Jellal.
My opinion is that it has too many characters and these characters aren’t fleshed out to a good standard due to the focus on the four main characters, I mean what’s the point of bringing them back if they don’t change at all, other than becoming more powerful with no logical explanation?
But then I did love certain characters in the anime and thoroughly enjoyed to see them in action so I couldn’t rate it too badly.
Art- 7/10
Not the best art I’ve seen but it was decent and considering the detail gone into those magic circles, some of the fight scenes looked pretty awesome although I wouldn’t say it wasn’t an highlight. Also sometimes it was slightly inconsistent, one second a character looks good, the next they are warped that they go from decently looking to pretty horrendous and in the latest the arc, the animation has dropped in terms of standards by quite a lot but that could be due to the lack of funding.
Soundtrack- 9/10
Definitely an up for the anime. The soundtrack by Yasuharu Takanashi is plain awesome. With a variety of upbeat battle music to the slower emotional ones, it captures every scene perfectly and fits the anime. I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack and despite having a heckload of songs in each, it was worth my time converting all the songs onto my ipod.
Enjoyment- 7/10
Yeah, I know I rated the anime pretty low but I did finish every episode within the period of a month and enjoyed it immensely. Maybe as this quote says “Whether fairies have tails or not, or whether they even exist, nobody knows for sure. So it's like an eternal mystery, an eternal adventure.” An eternal adventure that doesn’t end, there was always more jobs, always tough situations and it just doesn’t end with a happy ending for most things. In a contrast to reality I think this was the reason why I enjoyed it, an eternal adventure, an escape.
Final Score- 7/10
For a long-running manga, it has its highlights and its detractors but based on everything I did get some form of enjoyment out of it despite the poor story line so I couldn’t rate it too badly. It was decent for a shonen and not appallingly bad like some others.
Yeah, I know I said quite a few negatives things about the anime but I judged it like any other anime and like any mainstream animes, it has the same flaws so I tried my best to ignore those tropes. 'Tried being the operative word'"

                                      (108/175 eps)","Ok, I watch Fairy Tail because everybody say it's similar to One Piece or FT is ripping off One Piece. Here are my thoughts from a One Piece fan point of view.

Story: 6
When I just start Fairy Tail, I was REALLY excited. A world of magic where everybody (mostly) have unique magics (just like One Piece Devil Fruit ability). Then they are in a guild with lots of colorful characters and a request board where they can do quests and earn money. I thought, wow, that's a really good base for some creative and unique story. But unfortunately, their adventures are kinda lacklusture compared to
                  ...
One Piece's. One Piece really had some amazing adventures (Sky island, desert kingdom, haunted island, fishman island under the sea etc). But I understand Fairy Tail is a lot more condensed. Each arc normally last only about 20+ episodes. One Piece is focused on Luffy's ambition to become the Pirate King. Fairty Tail's main objective is.. Natsu's search for Dragneel?? (I'm really not sure). 

Art: 8
The art is Fairy Tail is pretty conservative and stick to those typical modern anime. It'll appeal to wide range of audience. I know a lot of people are turned off by One Piece's unique art. One thing that really bugs me is the amount of fan service in the later part of the story. Lucy just happen to get her shirt torn off in every battle. I'm ok with fan service, but when it happens in a battle, it's hard to take it seriously. 

Sound: 8
This is not my forte. I don't really research much on voice actor/actresses. My impression of the music is good, the celtic style music suits the whole magic theme. 

Character: 7
There are lots of colorful characters in this anime. And their interactions are funny. Most if not all of the major characters have their background story. And Mashima had a lot of planning put into this, when you will find out how he/she got her name, or why he/she act that. But maybe Mashima put too much effort into this when one of my reaction when knowing how Erza got her name I was like.. ""Come one.."". However, the characters are not that wacky or as distinct as in Once Piece. And Erza's background is similar to Nico Robin, but Nico Robin seems so much stronger becuase Erza dwell too much about her past. It's sad because she should be the tough one.

Enjoyment: 9
The fighting in Fairy Tail is not really intense. Since most of them will be done within an episode. My favorite battle is when Mirajane is fighting =). It really eclipse even Natsu's battles. The jokes in FT is pretty funny, and the huge number of characters are fun to watch.

Overall: 8
Overall, I had high hopes when starting this anime, my enthusiasm slightly wane during the middle. It's a good anime, don't get me wrong, I even read the manga after I caught up to the anime since I want to know what happen next. Just don't predict this anime, because there are too many ""ohh.. ok.."" moments, like the author making up his own rules along the way. But that's to be expected in ""magic"" world right??"
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,"RecommendedPreliminary
                
                                      (48/175 eps)","Okay, so I wanted to write a review about Fairy Tail for a while, and here it is.

Honestly I nearly dropped the show after a few weeks. The story is just your average shounen, nothing really outstanding yet. The art is only slightly above average, the magic circles look kind of weird and the fights aren't as intense and well animated as they could be. So normally this would have been dropped by me, as many other average to slightly good shounens.
However there were three things that kept me hooked, and these are the main things I want to talk about here.

First, and this is
                  ...
only for the fanboy in me, this show does not only have Hirano Aya, but also Kugimiya Rie. That alone was enough for me to keep me interested for a while, and if your a sucker for their voices like me, then you'll probably really like the interaction between Lucy and Happy. As for the other voices, they are generally quite good too.

The second thing I really enjoyed about Fairy Tail are the characters. Most of the mages in Fairy Tail and especially the main characters are either awesome, funny or both. They are not to deep characters, but Erza, Lucy, Natsu, Grey and Happy as the main bunch are really enjoyable, so are the others like Juvia or Makarov.

But what really kept me watching the show is the music. This anime has one of the best background music I've ever heard. Nearly every piece of music is memorable and extremely well down. From Irish Folk like pieces over Pop/Rock themes to pieces with influence from Symphonic or Power Metal the soundtrack is simply perfect. They could probably show a few stick figures doing their laundry and I would still watch it just because the music is so great. They could even air a discussion of your local parliament and with this music it would seem like an awesome battle. Almost everytime a new piece of music starts I can feel shivers running down my back. The music in this anime is just outstandingly good.

So if you are interested in shounen I would suggest at least trying Fairy Tail. It is a fine show, with a few flaws and an unbelievable awesome Sound."

                                      (126/175 eps)","For the longest time, I was very reluctant to watch any Fairy Tail. The reviews I read were incredibly polarized, either praising it to high heavens or dooming it to the thrash heap. But no one can deny the huge popularity of the show, so after I was done with binge-watching many serious seinen/josei series, I needed some dumb fun, so after all these years I gave Fairy Tail a chance. After 130 episodes, I'm still not sure I made the right choice. Let me explain...

Right after the first episode it was obvious Fairy Tail was designed by a committee to be TNBT (The Next
                  ...
Big Thing) in shōnen anime. Taking up the mantle from Dragon Ball, Pokemon, Bleach, One Piece and especially Naruto, Fairy Tail is the same ""fun for the whole family"" type anime. It uses the same exact recipe, one main protagonist, many typecast side-characters, all part of the same group, and they go on adventures, defeat evil in spectacular eye-candy fights, for justice and camaraderie, etc. We all know how it goes. 

But Fairy Tail brings a few twists into the mix. First of all, it tries a new format. Instead of incredibly long, drawn out arcs and fight scenes to draw out the run time, it operates with a machine gun for content. The story arcs are short but there are an incredible number of them. This eliminates boredom, but does get a little old after while, when it seems Natsu and gang saves the world from some new apocalypse five times a week. Same goes for fights, which are ""short and sweet"", never get boring or outstay their welcome. They do repeat things a lot, but at least we don't have to watch the protagonist ""gather power"" for twenty episodes for that one special attack, grinning through the exertion like he is about to soil himself. When Natsu says ""you're gonna get it now!"", he really means NOW, not four months later, which is kind of refreshing. It seems the creators really did their best to come up with new stories, enemies, arcs and fight sequences for every episode, without reusing much of them, which is very commendable, but I wonder how long they can keep this up...

One thing that helps this process is the incredibly lax laws of Fairy Tail's concept. This is an anime where literally everything goes, from easy going adventure, happy fun times, heated and serious battle, unimaginable evil, crying, death, pain and suffering, oh, and also dragons, flying cats, flamboyant wizards, fan-service boob parades and The Butt Jiggle Gang. There is practically no limit on the imagination here. This makes the series less boring than any shōnen adventure series I watched so far, but also a little inconsistent and sometimes hard to follow.

The other thing is the series tone. In short, it's all over the place. Fairy Tail is incredibly self-aware when it comes to humor. Sometimes it's smart and witty, but largely it's goofy, slapstick and low-brow as far as kids anime gets,  uses lots of pop-culture references, tons of fan service and it breaks the fourth-wall so frequently it might as well not be there. This makes the series largely really fun, and makes for some great ""laugh out loud"" moments. The only problem is, the creators don't seem to know the biggest secret of humor is TIMING. They frequently ruin serious or emotional moments with jarring slapstick bits, bad puns or just pathetic scripting. 

It's not just the humor, though, but the way the series never really takes itself seriously. Yes, it's not a bloody, gory, cursy seinen series, but sometimes Fairy Tail takes ""family friendly"" a little too far. All the characters are wearing ""plot armor"", even the antagonists, so no one dies in fights, or gets hurt worse than a few boo-boos. This makes for some very anti-climactic fights, when you know just how low the stakes are. When the enemy gets ""defeated"" it only means they get knocked out for a while, after which they usually come to and grumble about being defeated. That said, the biggest hurdle for me is when the enemy turns out to be a good guy in disguise, which happens with alarming frequency. Many times during big, epic fights, the antagonist gets something hidden revealed about their past or the situation at hand, and they instantly turn into good little puppies, stopping everything in it's tracks, which is the cause of some the most jarring anti-climactic endings I've ever seen. ""Me trying to murder you all and take over the world, it was all just a misunderstanding, I'm not evil, I'm actually a good guy, honest!"". Worse yet, many of them turn out to be flat out heroes. And the protagonists just go along with it EVERY TIME, without question. ""Oh, no biggie, you didn't manage to murder EVERYONE or destroy EVERYTHING, so I guess we forgive you. Hey, now that you are not evil, how about joining us?"". And that happens more times than I can count. This releases the carefully built tension with a wimpy fart-noise instead of a BANG and makes many of the story arcs really lackluster and unsatisfying in the end.  

The characters serve their purpose. That's about the best thing I can tell about them. The protagonist, Natsu Dragneel, is a Naruto wannabe, with a lot less personality and a lot more annoyance. The typical absolutely clueless, but incredibly powerful adolescent manchild, who is incredibly high-strung, always rushes into battle without any amount of thinking, gets his ass kicked, then gets up heroically and defeats the enemy with one last spectacular attack with the power of friendship/love/family/courage/cookies/refrigerator/whatever. Rinse, repeat. BORING! Same goes for the rest of the pathetic cast, which are all typecast trope-factory rejects, fan service bimbos, prissy tsundere, cutesy moe and talking chibi animals. The cliché-meter is so off the charts, it's insane.

BUT!

And this is a big but, because with all that said, surprisingly enough, Fairy Tail is...FUN! A huge amount of fun, in fact. I can't really put my finger on it, because if I look at the individual parts, the story, the characters, the world, etc, it SHOULD be a huge trainwreck, a bad flop. Fairy Tail should have crashed and burned before if even started. And yet, somehow it works! The incredibly cheesy and pretentious story, the goofy, slapstick, fourth-wall-breaking humor, the huge amount of low-brow fan-service and the characters, kings and queens of Cliché Mountain, it all somehow comes together to form something really fun and entertaining. The fast paced, varied, no-nonsense story and action is very captivating, and the weird humor somehow does work, despite ruining many of the serious and emotional moments. As I said before, Fairy Tail is very self-aware and seems to wear it's faults and shortcomings like a badge of honor, with a knowing wink to the audience.

Most of all, what makes this series for me is THE MUSIC. It's simply incredible! And I'm not talking about the OP or the ending, but the backing tracks! I always liked metal music, but Fairy Tail's background music is simply awesome! The celtic-style flace-flaying heavy metal suits this series incredibly well and elevates what could've been a mediocre schlock to a really enjoyable experience, at least for me. Fairy Tail's OST now dominates my favorite anime music top list, and with good reason. Most anime series have one or at most a few good songs, but this time THE ENTIRE OST is pure awesome, which is very surprising for me. The thunderous, shredding metal makes every fight scene at least twice as epic! Huge thanks for the musicians who made these!

All in all, Fairy Tail is a weird mix of utter nonsense, that somehow comes together to form a very enjoyable experience and it's so immensely popular with good reason. On paper, it shouldn't be. It's pretentious, pedantic, goofy and a huge amount of dumb fun that never seems to end. If you are ever tired of high-brow, intense and meaningful seinen/josei series, give Fairy Tail a spin to clear your palate or just take it as something to watch on a boring afternoon."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"Fairy Tail is probably the worst shounen of the big three, but its not the worst anime ever. This is an honest review and I am not hating. I will look at the good and the bad of the show.

Story - (2/10)
What story? Fairy tail is a string with cliches plots and fight scenes attached to it. It's as if Hiro Mashima wanted to add every shounen cliche ever, into his show, time skip, tournament arc, alternate universe. The entire story is predictable and so are all the fights, Natsu and his friends always win with the power of friendship which is horrible. Hiro Masima
                  ...
refuses to kill off any of his characters (besides extensions ie. edo-Lisanna or future Lucy or ghost-like Mavis) You know the heroes will win in the end through overused tropes and cliches, so unoriginal.

Art - (7/10)
The animation is fine. It's very good during fight scenes, it's nothing too spectacular though.

Sound - (9/10)
I can't even lie. The soundtrack is amazing. The old European Irish style and flutes are nice. The Openings are so energetic and the endings are so calm and sad.

Characters - (3/10)
Fairy Tail probably has the worst cast ever. I have never seen such one dimensional characters in an anime. Natsu and friends ALWAYS win. No mater what, no matter how unrealistic, through the power of friendship. Natsu is honestly the worst anime protagonist ever, he never trains or does anything and everything always works out fine for him. Villains are even worse, they have such one dimensional goals (take over the world muhahahaha!) and the worst part is how after losing in a fight against Natsu they automatically ""turn good."" Like seriously, sociopathic murderers are totally kind-hearted and nice after losing in a fight.? really? Other than a butt kicking from Natsu, they also receive no punishment for their actions. 

Enjoyment - (5/10)
I think this is only reason why Fairy tail is popular is because its enjoyable. The fight scenes are fun and show is sometimes funny. People (not me) also enjoy the fanservice.

Overall - (4/10)
Overall, Fairy Tail is a gigantic messed that looks like bad fanfiction. I recommend it to those who have no real taste in anything."

If you haven't watched those showa, get to them, if you did and you aren't willing to invest in 700+ episodes of One Piece then FAIRY TAIL is a must watch and you're sure to like it if u had any pleasure watching, say, Naruto or Bleach as it's likely
                  ...
better although everything depends on personal taste.
It takes place in a magical world like any other with the FIRED-UP (natsu) protagonist the COOL-EMO rival (grey) and the ANNOYING protag/narrator (lucy), seems dumb? well, the highpoint of the series is the camaraderie in the wizard guild Fairy Tail with its 20ish main members and their challenges and individual growths.
The character development is great but the guild's development is awesome and makes you feel like you want to be a part of it and join their battles.
It's also surprisingly very funny, and every character has his/her own shine that add to the series' completion. Even the villains and rival guilds don't go to waste, with every character quirk milked for all it's worth.
Unfortunately the fight scenes are weaker then the average long running shounen and the clear-cut story arcs sometimes stand out as being a ""WTF just happened"" moments, and the arcs are sometimes quite repetitive. I actually made a YouTube video FAIRY TAIL ABRIDGED IN A NUT-SHELL it's a minute and a half long and basically sums up most of the story arcs.
And as a final note: There are epic, heart wrenching and badass scenes backed up with some of the greatest anime music of all time that will make you laugh, cry and scream with conviction.
If you've watched the classics and you know your taste FAIRY TAIL is definitely a solid recommendation for you (I'd catch it before it becomes One Piece length and you lose your chance XD)."

But after awhile, everything became predictable. The humor is still there, but the plot and fighting scenes turned childish.

Okay to begin with, I find the story plot of fairy tail, very unique and original. Unlike Harry Potter and other fanatsy based animes, they don't use wands for once! Like you just get so sick and tired of wands after a while. Anyways, the plot is excellent because it has comedy, action, fantasy, a tad of romance which is a very good combo. So 10/10 for
                  ...
that.

Second of all the characters are all different and have a wide range of personalities. I would say, even the antagonists of the story are very well portrayed. It's easy to make you hate the villan but in Fairy Tail, you will come to sympathise or even begin to like (like me) the villans. All of the characters in the story have some kind of tragic past which just peaks your interest. So i would say the characters are described much in depth. (10/10)

Another wonderful thing about Fairy Tail is the character design. They all look stunning because most of the guys are hot (including the villans) but the down side is that the girls look pretty average. However, their outfits are quite nice and it usually changes every season or so (at least for one character). The most spectacular thing about the art are the backgrounds. They just look beautiful. (10/10)

Okay, the best thing i think which makes Fairy Tail stand out is their OST. Their background music always fits the scene and is very catchy. Everytime i listen to their battle theme music, it just makes my blood boil and it just feels so epic and cool. Fairy Tail has one of the best and most unforgettable OSTs out their. Though the downfall is that the opening and ending themesongs aren't that great.

Anyways, Fairy Tail is by far the best anime I've watched. It doesn't lose to Bleach, Naruto or KHR who all have heaps of filler eps. FAIRY TAIL DOESN'T HAVE FILLER EPS! So a great anime, with great music and great plot. My final word: A must watch."

However, the art and animation are so awful it completely ruins my enjoyment of what would otherwise be a solid 7. Animation quality throughout runs about the same quality as a Bleach or Naruto filler episode. The characters are flat and lifeless, stock animations are reused for special moves, the action is stiff and wooden. It's clear that they aren't putting much effort into this.

Story: 6/10
The story is driven by arcs and its structured so each of them features a big boss. the reasons i gave a 6 are: weak development and consistency.

weak development comes into play when i think back to when i started the series. 
                  ...
175 episodes have passed and if you look back to the start how much has the character changed? what about what events have changed drastically the plot? for a 175 episodes, not enough in my opinion.

consistency comes into play when i think about all the things they make up. some spells look so overpowered and end up being weak later on. (rune magic for example) there are many spells that feel that they are just there because the author wanted to create this type of scenario rather than being consistent.

Art: 9/10
No complains here but still not my favorite. The animation is well done and the art has a good style to it.

Sound: 10/10
One of the best soundtracks i have heard in a while. they are many memorable songs and they really give an awesome mood to the show. definitely one of the reasons that made me stick to the show.


Character: 7/10
characters are fine. they is little development in the 175 episodes that i have watched as i said before. however this is not a big deal. my biggest complain about character is that they are over ridiculed. by this i mean they tend to exaggerate certain ridicule characteristics like Natsu's inability to ride vehicles or gray stripping (and everybody overreacting to it). i mean they are fun and all it just that sometimes it is too extreme.

Enjoyment: 8/10
my main problem is that often a very serious and epic mood is broken by a bad placed joke (the scene cut animation also help in this). don't get me wrong i really enjoy comedy i just think that placing comedy in the middle of the climax is really mood breaking. other than that the series was pretty enjoyable. i have to admit that i watched some of it fast forwarding some parts because of redundancy but that was ok.

overall: 7/10
A series that you can enjoy but not a masterpiece at all or something i will put in my favorite list."

                                      (165/175 eps)","I have currently watched all of the Fairy Tail episodes that have come out to this date. 165. 

Fairy Tail has a ton of potential but it just loses it! The story becomes repetitive and the characters do not develop! You don't see them training hard enough, even with the 2 year time-skip. The comedy is getting less and the fan service more. 

You can obviously see the anime pushing between pairings. To me, that's not something I like. 

Unlike most top anime's, the endings are always predictable. Natsu mentions Nakama and suddently gains plot armor, wins and that's that. He is shown to be
                  ...
able to defeat anyone, even when it doesn't make sense how he could defeat him.  After the battle, he doesn't develop nor does anyone give him recognition for what he has done. One of the worst parts for me is that he has no goal. Luffy want's to be the Pirate King, Naruto the Hokage. What is you're goal Natsu? Nothing. With no goal or actual aim for the show, it might remain longer, but with no development. 

P.S He only mentiones finding Igneel, which bothers me a lot, since he doesn't even care about his REAL parents.

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"If there was ever an anime that you could just watch mindlessly and enjoy, Fairy Tail is probably it.

I'm not going to delve too deeply into any of the criteria, because frankly, Fairy Tail doesn't really excel in any of it. It's another run-of-the-mill, ""good guy overcomes the odds without really explaining why or how he got there"", ""friendship conquers all"" anime. Are the characters very deep or develop well? Not really. Does the story progress? Yes. Does it feel like any progress is being made? Nope.

However, if there is one thing that Fairy Tail is, it's enjoyable. As cliche and underdeveloped as the characters
                  ...
can really be, they're fun and lovable. As simple and underwhelming as the story can be, it's easy to follow and doesn't take much if any effort to follow or get in to.

Fairy Tail is what I'd love to call my ""chill"" anime. I'm always looking for something new to watch, but when I can't decide on something, I default back to Fairy Tail and catch up. Can't decide between action or comedy? Fairy Tail. Bored at home and want something to do? Watching Fairy Tail.

Overall, just watch it. If you're super into story or character development, it won't be your cup of tea. If you have any other opinion on anime, though, I'll bet you $5 that you'll love it."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"I think one thing people need to keep in mind when watching Fairy Tail is that it is an adventure shounen. There will not be much character development. Nobody will die. This is literally made strictly for people who like watching action fights, interesting arcs, and the occasional emotional outburst that may or may not make your heart melt, depending on the type of person you are.

That being said, Fairy Tail is one of my favorite animes. Many people like to compare it to One Piece, because they are similar. In my opinion, I like Fairy Tail better, but only because I just recently started
                  ...
catching up on One Piece, whereas many people have been watching it for years. I understand that can make one attached to an anime, so understand where I'm coming from when I say I like FT better, because I've been watching it for a much longer time. 

Now, for the actual review. The animation is alright to be honest. I've seen animes with much better animation, and I've also seen some with much worse. This is in-between, and it's not a deal breaker. I still love the show despite it's flaws. 
The characters are probably my favorite ever. They all share deep bonds and would naturally die for each other. Over the years I've grown emotionally attached to them, because they're over all just good people. Their unity is in friendship, which can solve all problems in this show. If you're someone who does not go for that kind of stuff, don't watch this. You'll hate it. 
The sound is pretty good. I have grown to love Fairy Tail's OSTs, so I am very biased when writing this. I've enjoyed this anime a lot. I've gotten a lot of feels from both reading the manga and watching the episodes. I'll admit that one of the arcs (Starry Heaven) was a bit dull for my taste, and the fact that it went on for so long makes it worse. Other that that, this anime gets a 9/10 for me."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Fairy Tail is the show that got me back into watching anime. It felt very nostalgic like I watching Toonami when I was a kid.

Fairy Tail follows the adventures of mainly Natsu Dragneel, Happy, Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, and Erza Scarlet. The young wizards are part of a guild called Fairy Tail located in the city of Magnolia. They take job request and most of the time they are trying to help Lucy make her rent. Along the way they get into conflicts with other guilds. The show has okay to good comedy and the fan service in this show can be a little too
                  ...
much but I digress. This show has intense action scenes and a story that will leave you entertained.

The animation in Fairy Tail is very good. However, like many other shows there are some scenes where the animation is outstanding.

The voice acting in Fairy Tail is very good most notably Colleen Clinkenbeard as Erza Scarlet and Todd Haberkorn as Natsu Dragneel in the Funimation dub. The music I thought was also good.

There are SO many great characters in Fairy Tail with unique personalities and magical abilities. Natsu Dragneel is a Fire Dragon slayer who is very gung-ho on going on dangerous jobs and picking fights with his guild members. He was also raised by Igneel and was abandoned by him in the year x777 on July 7th. Happy is a flying blue cat that is Natsu's buddy. Lucy Heartfilia is a celestial spirit mage who is very kind hearted but can be cold and rude at times especially with the guild members antics. She ran away from home and was heir to the Heartfilia family fortune. Gray Fullbuster is an Ice mage who has an unusual habit of stripping his clothes. Finally there is Erza Scarlet who can requip into different armor. She was a slave forced to build a tower and later joined Fairy Tail after she lead a revolt on the people who forced them into labor. Also there are some secondary characters that deserve mentioning like Juvia, Gajeel, Mirajane, Elfman, Wendy, and Master Makarov.

I had a blast watching Fairy Tail. It has funny moments that will get a chuckle out of you and the story is just so intriguing that you just want to keep watching. Now there are a few problems I have with the show and that is they use the power of friendship WAY too much in this show and in doing so they get a power up and defeat the villain. Another is that some of the episodes have a little too much fan service and I don't mind fan service, but there has to be a point where it's just to much for an episode. Overall Fairy Tail is a great anime that is full of adventure, comedy, and action. It's also why I consider it one of my favorite anime's of all time."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Mixed Feelings,"Story: The story was decent but irritated me at times. For example, the many missions Natsu & Friends did that didn't develop any character or change the story, the many filler episodes, the weak characters of the, apparently, 'Strongest Guild', and mostly, the Timeskip. I really don't know what Fairy Tail was really aiming to do, their goals and whatnot but I do know that Natsu was aiming to find Igneel, the Dragon, everyone else, I don't know. The reason why my rating is 3/10 is mostly because of the many cliches in the anime. Ex: Fanservie characters (Virgo), abusive parents (Lucy), Parentless childhood (Natsu,
                  ...
Dragneel, Wendy, Erza), and mainly PLOT ARMOR. It's not even a coincidence the characters survive death so many times because there is a tree on an island that makes it so that anyone with the Fairy Tail Mark CANNOT die, ever. Another reason (my main reason) for my low score is the Time Skip. When I was watching the episode after the Time Skip when Fairy Tail returns, I was so excited to see all the characters 7 years older and how much stronger they've become but then, Fairy Tail spits in my face to tell me that the members of Fairy Tail didn't improve at all and has actually gotten weaker than before, with the remaining member of the guild just sitting around getting fat and not training at all for 7 years.

Art: the art wasn't ""Oh my god, this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen"" but it wasn't the worst art i've seen. I guess you can say it's on par with the art of Naruto (Original) 8/10

Sound: I loved the soundtrack to Fairy Tail, everytime I watched an episode and heard the openings, it left me wanting to watch more episodes (Up until the Timeskip, of course.) The Voice Actors were well-picked and the battle music wasn't bad.

Characters: At the beginning of Fairy tail, (Ep 0-20) Natsu and Lucy fought Virgo. When they fought her, they struggled and had a hard time beating her. Lucy now has Virgo under her command. Currently, Virgo is a piece of crap who Lucy never uses and is not strong against enemies. From that time to the timeskip, Natsu, Lucy, Erza, Gray, none of them trained at all but you're telling me, they can fight on Par with a guild leader, let alone, Gildarts?
I don't like how none of the characters train but get stronger randomly without any sort of Shounen-type train (500 Pushups don't count)? I give the Characters, without getting specific, a 5/10 for the stated reason.

Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Fairy Tail, it was a pastime for me. I enjoyed it at a 7/10 right up until the Timeskip. When the timeskip happened, I felt like stealing the last 100 episodes back and using the time it took me to watch it on actual schoolwork that I skipped. Let me put it this way, beofore the timeskip, Fairy Tail wasn't even the strongest guild. Why the hell would they get to be frozen for 7 years while everyone else gets overwhelmingly older/stronger than all of Fairy Tail? Think of it like this, in just 2 years, characters from One Piece 5 times stronger than they were previously so in 7 years, the characters from One Piece would be blowing up continents at that point. So from 7/10, my score lowers to 4/10 just because of the Timeskip.

Overall: Fairy Tail is a 6/10, I am NOT going to finish watching/reading due the senseless timeskip."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Mixed Feelings,"Oh look, it's an unpopular opinion! It seems like everyone just likes to rag on Fairy Tail because it's the cool thing to do. I'm not gonna lie, I'm guilty of talking shit about it just as much as everyone else but at the same time... there's no changing the fact that I genuinely did enjoy watching it quite a bit. Is Fairy Tail the worst battle shounen series out there? No. It really isn't. You mean to tell me that in the ENTIRE history of battle shounen anime, Fairy Tail has to be the worst one of them all? Come on... try harder, people!
                  ...
I'm sure some of the older otakus on this website who've watched hundreds of thousands of animes can think of several other programmes that are objectively worse than Fairy Tail. 

Don't get me wrong though, I understand WHY people like to rag on Fairy Tail. It does have some major problems and for what it's worth, even people in the fandom agree with that sentiment. At the same time, I think way too many people just focus on perpetuating the circle-jerk surrounding this series by parroting basically everything negative which has already been said about this series ad nauseum. Talk about irony. Meanwhile, I love how people talk shit about Fairy Tail and yet don't apply the same criticisms they levy to the programmes that they truly enjoy. Watching a Narutard talk shit about Fairy Tail is just as entertaining is like watching a DC/Marvel fan talking shit about manga.

***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING***

Fairy Tail takes place in a farcical world dominated by magic and follows the travels of a troupe of mages as they travel the globe on various missions and whatnot. Well, that's the condensed version anyway. One of the biggest problems that Fairy Tail has is the fact its arcs are very short, which is paradoxically its biggest strength to me (more on that in the next section). You see, Fairy Tail is one of those battle shounen animes where I'd really like to see more of the universe that this story takes place in explored but sadly it doesn't because one of its calling cards doesn't allow for it.

I see people often comparing Fairy Tail to One Piece, but I feel like that's often made by people who've only taken a cursory look at both programmes and then come to the conclusion that they're virtually identical because they look similar, the leading males are both gluttonous idiots, and friendship is a shared theme. However, One Piece's claim to fame is an infinitely expanding universe which has a remarkable degree of complexity and thought put into the writing. This is obviously the case because the arcs are just as long as they need to be in order to allow each island the Straw Hats visit make their mark on the story. Fairy Tail's short arc length doesn't allow for any of that shit to happen whatsoever which is ultimately its biggest failing.

I can forgive some of the more annoying running gags and the fan service to a large degree had there been a vast universe to explore, but from Episode 1 all the way to 175, that just wasn't the case. I'm not saying that the world that Fairy Tail remains completely stagnant from beginning to end, because there were *some* things that changed along the way, but nowhere near as much world-building as I had hoped for there to be. Really now, how could Hiro Mashima drop the ball on this one? I could easily think of several places along the way where the writing could've been improved to bring in some more insight on the world that this story takes place in but alack... another story of what could've been.

***THE STORY***

Going back to that short arc length, the reason why I think that it's Fairy Tail's biggest strength in addition to being its most crippling flaw is because this makes the programme very easy to watch. Given the fact that I'm working full-time and have filial obligations, I lack the time and quite frankly the will to keep up with continuously overarching stories like I used to. Do you think that I'm up-to-date with One Piece? Oh HELL to the fucking no. I'm still like 100 chapters behind and even further behind with the anime. It's the fact that Fairy Tail's arcs are short and yet still packed with plenty of action and comedy to spare whilst also being able to take itself seriously if only for a brief moment when the time comes for it to do so which kept me around for so long.

With that said, there are several glaring problems that Fairy Tail has when it comes down to the story writing. For one thing, a large portion of the writing feels recycled from other battle shounen anime. Rave Master, Dragon Ball, D.Gray-man, Soul Eater, Hunter x Hunter, Yu Yu Hakusho, InuYasha, Naruto, Bleach, Busou Renkin, Fullmetal Alchemist, One Piece, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, etc., these are all battle shounen anime/manga which have done pretty everything that Fairy Tail does but managed to do so better whilst also bringing something new to the table or at least managed to put their own spin on it so that the story doesn't feel like the same tired-out battle shounen formula. What really irritates me is that there are individual parts of the story which genuinely did have me interested but these individual elements were discarded in favour of marketability (short arcs full of action, comedy, and fan service is what this show is all about, right?).

The second biggest problem that Fairy Tail has with its story, the comedy. Yeah... comedy on the whole is a very subjective thing and despite being 25 years old, I'm no better than an overgrown man-child. I still find Beavis and Butt-head laugh-out-loud hilarious and sexual/vulgar humour still packs the same punch for me that it did back in middle school and high school. You'd think that I'd get a LOT of mileage out of Fairy Tail given that I'm an immature person, right? Well... not exactly. Natsu's extreme motion-sickness gets on my nerves more than Luffy's stupidity. It wasn't funny the first time, and yet Hiro Mashima and A-1 Pictures by extension still chose to keep that stupid gag throughout the entirety of its run. It's really the overuse of running gags which were never funny in the first place which dampens the comedy which is quite a shame because whenever Fairy Tail manages to get a laugh out of me, I burst out into uncontrollably loud and annoying cackling.

The third biggest problem that Fairy Tail has? Fan service. I really don't know what it is about battle shounen anime and having girls with huge racks and bizarre proportioning. I just don't find that shit attractive (Book 3, Chapter 5 of Avatar: The Last Airbender is my idea of fan service done right, but I digress). Also, this is just a personal gripe I have but why does Gray always have to be shirtless at least once per episode? For the girls to fawn over? Come on... at least make them wait for that shit. It loses its impact if it happens almost every single episode. Now if you're into girls with huge racks sporting plenty of cleavage and shirtless guys that are ""ripped,"" as the young people like to say it nowadays, I'm sure this won't be a problem for you but it is for me so too bad!

I could go on to say that the battles rely far too heavily on power-ups, but I really don't give a shit about that since they're pretty damn entertaining to watch (especially given that battles are animated rather well) Besides, if you're going to rag on Fairy Tail for using power-ups and not levy the same criticism to programmes like Gurren Lagann, you're a waste of thought. People, this is a SHOUNEN series. By the end of it all, Fairy Tail is essentially the Japanese equivalent of Xiaolin Showdown: it's nothing more than mindless entertainment for sugar-high kids on Saturday mornings. Do you really think that there would be complex and intricate battles with all kinds of strategy out of something meant to be shallow entertainment?

Speaking of which, it's time for something I like about Fairy Tail! When it comes down to its overall style, Fairy Tail knows exactly what it wants to be and it doesn't really set itself up to be anything greater than it actually is. If phrases could manifest themselves in anime form, Fairy Tail would be the embodiment of ""What you see is what you get. Don't like it? Well fuck off, we don't need you here."" As far as shallow entertainment goes, there's plenty of it here. If you're the kind of person who wants something along the lines of Ulysses, Paradise Lost, or In Search of Lost Time, why the fuck are you expecting it out of Fairy Tail when its claim to fame is short arcs chock full of action, comedy, and fan service? That's just like expecting a culinary masterpiece out of McDonald's.

Now, there is one thing that I have a bit of a gripe with and that's the fact that Fairy Tail basically ended on a rather nasty cliffhanger and that was basically your lot until A-1 Pictures came out with the second series which has received... let's just say ""mixed reception."" Now granted, the second series DID come out almost a year ago and it's still rather early in the show's run. Let's just hope that A-1 Pictures gets their shit together before more circle-jerk reviews come into the picture. I could also rag on the filler, but let's face it: filler in battle shounen anime is prone to being terrible and there's no point in bitching about shitty filler in Fairy Tail when the filler in Naruto and One Piece is just as bad if not worse (well... more like padding in One Piece's case). 

***THE CHARACTERS***

I just want to get this out of the way first: I don't like Natsu, I've never liked him, and he's REALLY annoying. The only battle shonen protagonist with an insatiable appetite who's also an idiot that I have the patience for is Luffy. Everyone else can go die for all I care. Throughout 175 episodes (and ~50 more in the new series), he has not changed a bit whatsoever. He's still all talk and no walk and the only time he can actually win a battle is with a power-up. I hate battle shonen protagonists like Natsu nowadays. The English dub makes him a good deal more tolerable since Todd Haberkorn is a great voice actor, but great voice acting can't help a shit-tier character. I'm sorry, Natsu fans. Gray 5evaaaaa.

The characters of Fairy Tail barring Natsu are all likeable to me, but the biggest problem I have with them is the fact that throughout the entire run of the series, they remain static as individuals. I like to see people grow and change over time in my programmes and mangas (although that little desire of mine can be overridden if the programme I'm watching is cool enough). From episode 1 all the way to 175, there is no significant changes that occur in the entire cast we hang around. Lucy, Gray, Natsu, et al are still the same as they were when they first started out. I mean, it's not all bad because at least they HAVE a sense of characterisation about them, but at the same time... I still think it's unforgivable that despite all the time that was put into this series, NOBODY has changed for the better.

***THE ART/ANIMATION***

Art-wise, I see a lot of people saying that it resembles One Piece's art style and well... as much as I'd like to disagree on that one, it's kind of hard NOT to notice Akira Toriyama's influence over the look of both of those series. I don't really mind the art style, and hell... I actually kind of like it but again: fan service just gets under my skin. Animation-wise, Fairy Tail was done by none other than A-1 Pictures, which I was rather surprised to see attached to a long-running battle shounen series like this one. When it comes down to visual quality, A-1 Pictures is no slouch whatsoever and they have programmes under their belt which are nothing short of eye-candy galore such as Blue Exorcist, Sword Art Online, and and both seasons of Magi.

It's a common occurrence in battle shounen anime for the animation quality to fluctuate quite a bit. Anything that isn't a battle may very well be animated with the same level of complexity as a flash game you'd find in the backwaters of Newgrounds. It's for that reason alone that I was caught off-guard when I saw that A-1 Pictures did a REALLY good job of keeping the overall animation quality across 175 episodes rather consistent. Yes, there are points where the animation takes a bit of a downward turn, but the rest of the series still looks remarkable from a technical standpoint. Battles are also animated exceedingly well which makes them nothing short of entertaining to watch, and you all know how much I love a well-animated battle!

It should also be mentioned that Satelight co-produced the animation alongside Fairy Tail. These are the guys who brought us Log Horizon's first season and the first four episodes of Hellsing Ultimate among other such viewing delectations. The fact that the animation quality remained more or less consistent across 175 episodes might have to do with the fact that there was more than one studio working on it. A-1 Pictures can't shoulder ALL of the burden, now can they?

***THE SOUNDTRACK***

When it comes down to music, it's hard to find another battle shounen anime which comes anywhere close to Fairy Tail. This is something that EVERYONE can agree on. Like you can talk shit all you want about the story, the characters, and the art style but when it comes down to music... hot damn! The only other battle shounen anime I can think of that comes close to Fairy Tail would be Blue Exorcist, and even then I find myself leaning toward Fairy Tail's OST. I'm not even joking when I say that I actually had the 3rd OP saved as my phone's ringtone WAY back when I was just starting to get into Fairy Tail. Oh how I miss being a NEET living in Chandigarh. :(

***THE DUB***

When it comes down to the sub vs. dub debate, don't buy into the dub hate that you might see here on the MAL forums. Funimation did an excellent job with the Fairy Tail dub. My favourite performances definitely come from Newton Pittman as Gray and Colleen Clinkenbeard as Erza. We also get some wonderful performances from the likes of Christopher Sabat, Brina Palencia, J. Michael Tatum, and other such Funimation regulars as supporting characters as well. I understand that there are a LOT of top-tier seiyuus involved with Fairy Tail but come on! The dub itself is some pretty damn good stuff too. Seriously, why so much dub hate?

***ANIME VS. MANGA***

Oddly enough, I've never read the manga for Fairy Tail at all. I still say that if you're a manga purist, you're probably going to want to go manga rather than anime. Manga lacks filler, after all.

***FINAL THOUGHTS***

Fairy Tail is one of those anime series that receives WAY more crap than it deserves which is quite a shame. Look, I understand that it's popular and that popular series more often than not are overrated. That still doesn't give people the excuse to constantly make shitty reviews of the programme in question which basically parrot shit that's been said before ad nauseum. If you're in the mood for some shallow entertainment and nothing more that you can enjoy with your friends, Fairy Tail can definitely deliver on that front and keep you entertained for a good while. It's one of those programmes that I feel is best in small doses. If you know exactly what you're getting into, you should be fine. Hopefully, this review actually managed to sway some peoples' opinions on the programme but whatever. Chances are that it'll be downvoted into oblivion by diehard fanboys and haters alike. God, I need to pick a target audience and stick with it.

***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS***

1) InuYasha and its sequel series, InuYasha: The Final Act
- One of the most popular anime series of the early 2000s (especially here in the West), InuYasha is another anime series which consists of many small, easy-to-watch arcs. However, the biggest difference between InuYasha and Fairy Tail is the fact that InuYasha's small arcs all add up to an overarching goal whereas the arcs in Fairy Tail feel inconsequential for the most part. InuYasha is also a partially romantic story as well so there's also that. It also helps to mention that Fairy Tail is still an ongoing manga with a TV sequel which is still currently airing. InuYasha ended in 2004 and The Final Act ended in 2009. The manga also completed its run in 2008 with 553 chapters total.

2) Gurren Lagann
- The bonds shared between Team Dai-Gurren is vaguely reminsicent of the friendship between Natsu, Gray, Lucy, etc. and power-ups are a huge part of each programme's battles (can you look at me with a straight face and NOT tell me that the Spiral Power ISN'T an excuse for constant deus ex machina?). However, Gurren Lagann opts for an extremely absurdist approach where logic and reasoning get thrown to the wayside in favour of being cool (as evidenced by Kamina's infinitely extending sword and his ability to pull his signature orange glasses out of thin air) whereas Fairy Tail doesn't really go that far with its fantasy elements. Also, the fan service in both series is similar... I mean, Yoko and Lucy pretty much serve the same purpose, don't they? Dem melons..."

Fairy tail is really funny it has comedy in every episode and i accually dont mind that the romance is very light if existant at all. The anime i would say is more comedy than anything else but the show accually has amazing fighting scenes and amazing characters because each different character has a different power,attitude and fan base. I really enjoyed this anime's fighting scenes so far plus the adventure

is a nice touch to all the comedy and action. At first when your watching this anime youll think Oh its just another comedy anime with no real story line but you are so wrong. Each character is fighting for somthing and each character has their own problems and own past that is unique plus the anime has many suprises as far as the characters pasts go because each persons past is somthing you will never guess. I cryed afew times in the anime because as you get further into the anime you start seeing alot of emotional pasts that make you think of how mabey you would have reacted so its got alot going for it.

                                      (83/175 eps)","Fairy Tail succeeds as a shounen anime where others fall short.

The fight scenes are not 30 episodes long, but are fast paced and have the viewer constantly on the edge of their seat. Similarly, the story arcs are not so extensively drawn out that you start to wonder what it was that attracted you to the show in the first place. The story keeps moving and the audience stays interested.

The music is fantastic. During humorous or relaxing points in episodes, fiddle-Irish-folk type music adds a fun atmosphere to the show. The same type of music is executed in a more intense rocker way with electric

guitar and the works. If Fairy Tail had nothing else going for it, the music could still carry the entire show.

The characters are lovable and quirky. Rarely ever will you find yourself disliking a certain character.

The powers are awesome and diverse. You aren't just exposed to crazy planet destroying energy blasts here, and you probably won't miss anything of the sort.

If you're the type of person who doesn't like shounen, give Fairy Tail a try. It's definitely a breath of fresh air."

Fairy Tail was the anime that got me to begin enjoying anime. In my opinion, it's probably the best anime for beginners out there(granted my love for anime only started this summer and I've only seen about 30 different anime). 
Stroy-9
The arcs are rather short which isn't something I personally mind. The stories are unique and fun, always offering a great deal of friendship. It's not going to be anything like a story as amazing as FMA Brotherhood or something, but it's sure to be entertaining. Every episode offers great battles, touching back stories, cool characters, and tons of humor.
Art-10
Not
                  ...
much to say here, the arts some of the better stuff I've seen. It's probably my favorite art style of everything I've seen.
Sound-10
I've watched the dub and the sub. I have to say, a few voices in the dub are a little annoying or don't exactly match the character as well as the sub does, but overall it's a pretty good dub, I'd rather watch it this way actually. I also have really enjoyed all the openings, music, and ends. The songs are always really fitting.
Character-10
Because it has so many episodes, the characters have time to be really developed. Each character has had their back story shown in depth, creating a good feel of how and why they are how they are. I really do love all the characters of this show. They're all really different but have the same morals when it comes to friendship and their 'Fairy Tail family'.
Enjoyment-10
Like I said, it's a series meant to be purely fun. It's the most enjoyable anime I've seen. You'll always be smiling or laughing while watching this.
Overall-10
Before you chastise me for such a high score, hear me out. It's a series that isn't meant to have a deep, thought provoking plot full of dark secrets and twists. It's main focus is to be fun, which it does an outstanding job of. I would 100% recommend Fairy Tail to anyone who's look for a series that'll make them laugh while giving an action dose."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"First off, there is nothing original about Fairy Tail. The author just takes concepts and ideas from other battle shounen manga and rehashes them in Fairy Tail in a dumber way. Of course, to hide this thing, he also adds a lot of fanservice. So, whenever there isn't a fight going on, Fairy Tail will look pretty much like your average softcore porn cartoon. The story of Fairy Tail is fairly simple: the main protagonists go somewhere, encounter a villain who initially beats them up, then Natsu gains a power-up and wins. Repeat this formula endlessly and there you go, you have created a successful
                  ...
way of milking the cash cow. Of course, other battle shounen anime use the same formula too, but at least they make the story flow better.

Another flaw of Fairy Tail is the lack of characterization. Simply put, the characters are not interesting enough. Most of them lack depth or personality, especially the females, whose personality flaws are compensated with giant breasts.

The good parts of this anime are its art and soundtrack. I have nothing against them. The fight scenes themselves are good, so is the color palette and the music.

So, overall, Fairy Tail is a very generic battle shounen that doesn't try to break the mold: it present the usual tropes found in other anime & manga of the same genre while adding some excessive fanservice."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"“Alone, you feel nothing but insecurity; that’s why we form guilds, that’s why we have friends. We walk together in order to live a strong life.” Makarov Dreyar, 3rd Master 

Fairy Tail centres on the unity of souls, so to speak, and it emphasises how the bonds between friends can be worth more than blood ties. 

The masters of the guild, Fairy Tail, all share the same belief that everyone has both light and dark in them, they need to be shown the right path. Stringing from this, many of the mages of darkness are affected by insecurities and their past. The producers actively contrast
                  ...
them with mages of light (such as those in Fairy Tail) with similar insecurities. In turn emphasising the importance of trust and friendship. Another reason as to why some of the “bad guys” just cannot be hated, in fact some of them have slid their way into my many favourites. The contrast made me rethink my outlook on life and the judgment of others.

One thing that many like about Fairy Tail, including me, is the manner in which these depths of life are hidden and entwined with scenes full of emotions- sadness, hatred, love and not to forget indignation. The last of the four is the most prominent theme of this anime, and is revisited with every arc. However, the producers have done an excellent job with lightening the mood every-so-often, with the characters and their personality, mainly featuring those of Fairy Tail.

The character most in focus is Lucy Heartfilia, who at first seems an add-on but as the story progresses you really get to understand her as a person and how strong her character really is, despite the ‘blond moments’. She is one character who shows the least anger and resent out of most characters and its surprising how she manages to do so (but I shall expand no more, otherwise I’ll be bordering spoiler-zone and we don’t want that do we, now? :p). 

The anime itself starts off with our dear Lucy getting trapped in the most absurd situations and a Fairy Tail mage saving her…you can find out who yourself when you watch it. They seem like her knight-in-shining armour and ironically she is a Princess herself! :p yup! You’re in for a ball, my friend! Having said that, although this character is always there, Lucy doesn’t always act as the helpless person, you would expect. This leads me on to character development…

The character development is by far the best bit of Fairy Tail and each and every character is fully explored, the main ones more so, but that is to be expected. The director has certainly done his part with making Fairy Tail a success with this aspect. However, I’ll have you know, that this anime is 175 episodes long so you are, no doubt, in for repetition. Fortunately, I didn’t find this a problem until quite a decent number of episodes in i.e. if you’ve been told that Fairy Tail is just a mush of different arcs with the same storyline, or thereabouts that’s not entirely true. But of course, it’s not a cup of tea for everyone! 

The more detailed overall story is pretty obvious but there are times where the fillers take the spotlight and you might be lost as to what’s happening. Personally speaking, this was one of the greatest flaws of Fairy Tail alongside the fan service that frequents as you near the end. But you get used to it! Personally I felt, that once you get into the anime and start admiring and understanding the characters, then you seem to enjoy the fillers more and more.

The art style is something that is given divided opinion, since it is very bold and the details are present, although are not emphasised. This compliments and shines a spotlight on Fairy Tail as a guild, because they are notorious as a troublemaker guild, however they are the most welcoming and possibly the most forgiving. The fighting style is also influenced greatly by the art style and the underlying motives of the anime. Talking about creativity, the OPs and EDs are plentiful and are well suited to their arcs and some have even entered my list of favourites! They begin and end each episode making it complete and finishing the ideas that were started off, kind of like tying up loose ends. 

So with all that blubber, my review about fairy tail comes to a close. Its such a huge series that being able to cover each and every aspect has been difficult, but hopefully I have wrapped it all off in my very first review! Beware of the over the top fighting scenes, though they really do get me going and some of them leave me laughing, the characters have a knack of doing that! The very last, incomplete arc leading to the second season will give you a very good idea of that! ;) ENJOY!

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"I want to say that I don't find this anywhere near ""amazing"" or even ""good"", because it isn't.

The start of the episode is good, and understanding the Fairy Tail Guild maybe a bit... difficult, but they're lovable. I find the beginning of Fairy Tail a lot enjoyable up until the Phantom Lord Arc (Reason is that it introduces... other similar traits like the main character, I should say). After that, it was just bring moments after another. It has character knowledge, and I'm perfectly good with that (for example: The reasoning behind Gray stripping). The arcs are not enjoyable after the Phantom Lord Arc, and
                  ...
I cannot put myself to think there are any decent ones.
Overall, there are some arcs that I happened to enjoy (even fillers).

Characters on the other hand... not so much. Natsu (main character) is such a poorly designed character. Lucy is shown to be an interesting character in the beginning of Fairy Tail, but eventually gets turned into a product of Fanservice.
To prevent myself from going on and on, I will have to say the only characters that interests me are: Gray, Master Makarov, and Gajeel.

Allow me to just put up my pros and cons for Fairy Tail:

Pros:
-Amazing soundtracks. I just love it, especially most of them are pleasant to the ears.
-Setting of the story is great. I cannot deny that one.

Cons:
-Plot is horrible. It's just a cliche'd format just like the previous ones, one after another (Natsu/Fairy Tail gets beaten'd by villains, villains lose round 2 by Natsu/Fairy Tail by Nakama Power)
-Poorly designed characters. I don't mind Natsu being an idiot, but man he's way too overpowered. Then Erza, who can use a magic that changes her armor/weapon, has a special armor in her gallery called ""Plot Armor"".
-The ""S**t just got real"" moments ruined by stupidity. This alone ruined the potential Fairy Tail had (For example: Natsu faces an opponent, his ""friend"" does something that triggered him and both of them are fighting each other while Natsu's opponent is literally staring at him).
-Fanservice... this is another reason why Fairy Tail's potential is ruined.

Overall: Fairy Tail needs to have its plot worked on, drop the fanservice and stupid moments (It's one thing if these moments happen in appropriate places, such as the Fairy Tail Hall). Once Mashima can do that, then I can reconsider my opinion. Otherwise, I would highly recommend people to watch/read Nanatsu no Taizai (I guess you could say it's the series that Fairy Tail should have been)."

OH NO NO NO. They WILL win! 'Cause they have the Powa of Friendship!

*Fairy Tail wins.

*repeats the cycle

 Is that all they could do?  Meh. The story is poorly written so I'll just give it a 3/10.

CHARACTERS:

This is irritating. Especially with Lisanna's part! Dude, she just came back and they be like nothing happened! On the other hand, Natsu's the same old Natsu. Thickheaded dragon slayer who obviously wins a fight every arc with his friendship power up of raging emotions. And Lucy and her celestial spirits. It annoys me how she summons them and the enemy's gonna beat them into a pulp. Aren't celestial spirits strong? (And to think that I was really expecting something from Lucy and Loke's relationship. Oh well.) Gray and Erza, they just gets dumber every episode. ESPECIALLY THE FIGHTS. At first, Fairy Tail's gonna give you an emotional fight mostly pertaining about to ""never give up"" / ""We are a family"" and suddenly... THE COMEDIC STUPIDITY RISES LIKE WTH ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Give me a break. I give 2/10. 


The SOUND is good. The ART is okay. 

The reason why I'm still watching this anime because it has something. A potential perhaps? Fairy Tail can be unique in many ways! So I can't just drop this one since I definitely love its manga.

I think all of us, who watched Fairy Tail, could agree that it is funny. Its humor is one of its potential, yet it is also its downside when it comes to the seriousness part of every arc. But, I find the enjoyment good. I find some parts of this anime interesting so I'll give it a 6/10.


OVERALL: 5 out of 10.

Excluding its plot and character development. Fairy Tail is not that bad of an anime. Some may find it enjoyable, and some may not. And I'm still halfway through so maybe I'll edit this review if I see another significance in this anime. If you haven't watched Fairy Tail yet, please do. It is not that bad as most of the viewers think. And as for me, I'll still push through until its next sequel; Fairy Tail (2014)."

If you liked Naruto, Bleach, and other generic shonen titles, you could do worse than Fairy Tail!

Story: 5/10

The story takes place in an alternate world where magic is common and wizards have formed a number of powerful guilds. The strongest of these guilds is Fairy Tail, to which our main cast of characters belong. Fairy Tail is told in 10-20 episode story arcs where usually Natsu and company must complete a new mission and fight a new adversary. That or its a tournament arc. Gotta have a tournament arc in every shonen since Dragonball. The story isn't bad, but it gets repetitive and I
                  ...
have a very good feeling that it won't end for at least another decade of the same thing over and over again.

Characters 5/10

Fairy Tail has a large collection of characters. It is unfortunate that the least interesting characters get the majority of the screen time. Natsu is a very bland and generic shonen hero. Lucy and Gray are annoying as hell and I can't stand either of them! Of course the worst character is Happy, who makes me want to bash my face repeatedly against a concrete wall. Remember Puar from DBZ? Make him 10x more annoying and stick him front in center in EVERY FUCKING EPISODE! That is Happy! Some characters like Erza, Mirijane, and Makarov are actually quite fun, and makes me wish I could see more of them instead of Lucy's whining, Gray's fan service, and Happy's... just everything he says and does.

Sound: 5/10

I couldn't really say the soundtrack left a huge impression on me. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorably great either. I suppose it performs adequately.

Art: 7/10

The art in Fairy Tail is pretty good for a 200+ episode shonen series. It isn't the greatest in the history of anime or anything, but it certainly is above average. Especially for a slightly older viewer like me that lived through the god awful art and animation of most 90s and 80s anime.

Enjoyment: 5/10

I realize that shonen is aimed at a 12-17 demographic and as a 26 year old I am not the prime target. That is why I am gonna go easy on Fairy Tale here. It has a few enjoyable moments, but they are few and far between for older viewers, not to sound like a jaded old man. I think if I were 12 or so years younger, I would probably like Fairy Tail a lot more, and be far more forgiving of its flaws. 

Overall: 5/10

Fairy Tail is a very average series. I watched the first 40 or so episodes and don't really have the desire to watch any more. I don't dislike it by any means, but I didn't personally find it very stimulating or interesting. Maybe if it had Erza as the main character and was cut down to 26-52 episodes it would be a more memorable shonen action series. I think I would at least give it a 7/10 if it had gone that route. Alas, that is never to be."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"I know Fairy Tail isn't over, and that it is coming back on April of this year but I really wanted more than a review, to share my taughts about this show.

Fairy Tail is about Lucy, a 17 year old mage, who wants to join a famous mages guild called ''Fairy Tail'' While visiting a town, she meets a pink-haired boy named Natsu and his cat, called Happy. It turns out that this boy is member of this guild, and he helps Lucy join.

Characters: For me this is one of the strong points in Fairy Tail. There is big variety of unique characters, some loveable,
                  ...
and some not so much, and a great character development of moslty the main characters (Lucy, Natsu, Gray, Erza and Wendy) and some others throught the series. There are various cases in which characters that were enemies of Fairy Tail, became allies, which happened lots of times, and it has become quite repetitive. Regardless, there is a big amount of characters, which makes the anime interesting.

Sound: The soundtrack of this anime is  impressive and unique. Most of them, such as the main theme, are of celtic style which is original and outstanding. I think the Fairy Tail Sountracks fit really good with the anime, which makes it more enjoyable. 

Story: The center of this anime is magic. It is used in a different way that we are used to in movies such as Harry Potter, in which they used wands but in this anime they use a sistem called  ''Magic Circles''. I really liked seeing all the different styles of magic that exist in that world, and how they used it, it was very cool and enjoyable.

 This story has 175 episodes, in which you experience various arcs. We have some arcs for the main characters, which I think that is very positive to get to known them better, and other ones which moslty contain all the guild fighting against an enemy. Regardless the action in the arcs, and the enemies, I think it was fine. I really dislike the ''Nakama Power-Up'' This anime has. What i mean with this, is that in ALL the fights, the character gain forces by thinking about their friends. I think that is better if they gained force by anger, or other more realistic feeling. In this anime one of the most important messages is the family. I think it is good, but it's bad to use that power in all the arcs. It becomes boring and repetitve.

The fights in this anime are good, they have as backround music an awsome fight soundtrack, and some epic scenes. BUT they never lose. They win all the fights which i find very disturbing. Some times is good to see them lose, so they can develop better, and become stronger using that motivation, but as i said that motivation is the family and friends. (They lose at the last arc, but some fights only). Anyways, the enemies of this show are awsome, and most of them have a back story, which helps us to understand them more, and to get to know them better (Which is excellent for me)

Art: I really like the art of this anime, but there are two things that disturb me a LOT. One: The lack of blood in the fights. This anime doesn't contain blood. Which makes the fights more unrealistic. Two: Fanservice. Lately, on the OVA5 and in the last arc, there is a LOT of fanservice. Which is sad because it takes a little bit of the enjoyment of the show. There has always been a little bit of it, but it has become annyoing, specially in the manga.

Taking aside or the bad things about this anime, it is really good. It makes you laugh, you fall in love with a lot of this characters, you may feel bad for some of them, or happy, etc. Im looking foward to see when it comes back, and maybe the bad things about it are corrected. 

FINAL SCORE: 8"
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"First, I would like to say that I rated Fairy Tail for what it REALLY is : an entertaining shounen without any originality. Don't get it wrong, FT totally accepts that. That's why I can't compare it with my others favorites animes (HxH, FMA, ...). 
When I watched the first episode of FT, I exactly knew what kind of anime it was going to be. Not a refined anime with a captivating story, no. I just wanted to watch an diverting/childish anime and FT suited perfectly for me.

Story : 4/10

The true good point of the story is that it takes place very quickly. You don't
                  ...
have to wait 40 episodes for it to begin. Even if it can be considerated as disregarded, most of people dont have the time/patience to wait that much and it makes them leave the show. The background is basic (magic, guilds, mages, ...) but still cool. The first episodes were really good since they described the guild and its crazy atmosphere very well. The plot really depends on the arc you are watching... Yes, there is a lot of ""clichés"" in FT but, in my opinion, it's not important since it's a shounen... 
I also appreciated the fact to not see them practice over and over again... It trends to be boring and not interesting sometimes.

Characters : 6/10

Despite its poor story, Fairy Tail has nice characters. Even if they are all similar because that is Fairy Tail, they all love each other, blablabla... They still have their own personality/role in the anime. I'll just define the main group characters as members of a body.
Lucy ""the brain"" : Maybe I defined this way because she is the only one to use her brain in the anime but she always magages to find a solution which is not ""smash smash smash"". I know a lot of people will be like : "" WAIT WAT LUCY HAS A BRAIN AND NOT ONLY BOOBS?LOL"" but no, she figured out a lot of problems despite the fact that yes, she gets undressed a lot (most of the time because of the group is asking her to...).
Natsu ""the arms/fists"" : just because of his ""burning"" personality. He is rushing the fight everytime. And God, that's funny to see him get wrecked by a villain. Yes, he mostly wins his battles by getting powered up but... Is it not the case in 95% for this kind of animes ?
Erza ""the body"" : her power (she is feared by almost all the others) and appearance (strong charismatic woman) will always bring the group together to face their problem. She is also the ""shield"" for the group/guild.
Grey ""the legs"" : my regret in this show... Grey is nothing but an alternative Natsu / a support in the group. First time I saw him, I was like ""oh god it's a Vegeta-like"" but no, they didnt managed to develop him correctly to make him badass as hell (but Luxus is here to catch this up I guess).
Wendy ""the heart"" : a sweet little girl who always cares for the others / wants to help them the best she can with her healing magic. She is also the only character that trully evolves in the anime (growing up, getting stronger, getting her own battles, etc...).

All the characters have a decent story even if we all regret that some of them don't get more attention from the author. The perfect example is Lisanna. She came back from the dead (or sort of) and she still remains unexploited ! She had a ""something"" with Natsu but it seems it is over... There is no more interactions between those two... That's too bad ! 
There is almost no characters dying in FT and it's fine for me ! I would still be so sad if a secondary character like Mira or Reby died :/ and it's just the case in FT I don't know why...



Art : 8/10 

The animations in the different battles are very good ! It's the same all along the anime but I don't get bored. The chara design is good too. Some people blame the show for his fanservice or more precisly, the fact that all the female characters have a big breast, you have to consider that it's completly normal in FT world... (judging by Levy, Wendy and Mavis reactions when they are talking about that lol). 

Sound : 10/10 

Wow ! In my opinion, FT has the BEST OST among the anime world ! I never feeled like that with a soundtrack before. Battles OST are intense, sad moments OST are touching. I can't tell more. But it depends on you I guess... For my part, when I'm watching an anime, I am completly immersed into the anime's world and, because of this, the OST is very important to ""live"" these moments.

Enjoyment : 9/10 

I really enjoy to watch Fairy Tail because it's very entertaining. It does not have a fantastic plot as others animes but it does have sweet characters and a proper atmosphere and I don't expect more from FT when I'm watching it. Fanservice gags make me laugh more than they disturb me (some people feel uncomfortable with it) and I don't consider them as annoying because it's a part of the FT's charm. Also, FT is one of the only animes which can make me laugh during a critical moment, forcing me to release all the pressure I accumulated (as I previously said, I really live through the anime when I'm watching it haha).


Overall : 7/10

Pros :

- Very entertaining.
- BEST OST EVER.
- Cool battles / animations / powers.
- Characters are sweet and you learn to like them but...
- Story/plot/arcs are cool but...

Cons :

- ... not pushed hard enough. It could have been much more interesting.
- Villains are not that bad ass / captivating (except for Zeref).
- 90% of fillers are really bad.
- [troll mode : on] Don't look the Eclipse Celestial Spirits arc ! [/troll mode : off] :P"

Story: The anime is really following the manga's storyline so that is a good, but also a bad thing. Due to it following the manga, the anime may get kind of dull at times like Lucy's part and some episodes, but overall the anime is pretty fast paced (which I like). The beginning starts off well, then it fills 4 episodes worth of character introduction so don't be turned off by them. Since Fairy Tail is a guild of course there are many characters
                  ...
so they want you to know each (that are important). In episode 5, the story starts picking up again and I'm hoping for some action like in the manga. Like I stated earlier, I read the manga thus I have a brief idea what's going to happen next and I anticipate for it as opposed to others who don't.

The art: Looks like One Piece. Nothing else I can say well besides for the wizardry fire parts Natsu performs with his fists and the dragon flying out that was kind of corny, but w/e I LOVE NATSU so I forgive.

Sound: I am absolutely disappointed by Natsu's and Grey's voice actors. I expected something more energetic from them, but instead I got some dull voices. The opening is a typical shounen opening nothing very memorable about it.

Overall, I have high hopes for this anime, but was horridly disappointed, but it's okay I have yet to lose hope because the juicy parts of the start has yet to start so guys just pull through! If you can watch Naruto's training arcs you can definitely watch Fairy Tail! :]"

The animation style is poor, there are so many missed opportunities for character development. it follows the stereotypical anime pattern of ""oh hey the baddest of bad guys has appeared, lets defeat him!"" then the next arc is like ""no this is the real baddest of the bad guys"" and then repeats. 

Somehow within the first 10 episodes I didn't notice the repeated animation frames. They can't animate two characters at the same time. Many of the
                  ...
fight moves are recycled animation clips. And sometimes to portray movement they simply add a moving background

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"So one day a mangaka that has never been seen without sunglasses decided to take his previous creation, Rave, and hardcore it up a notch, while correcting most of his previous mistakes, and also adding plenty of our western mythology instead of the crappy asian one. So in the end we get an anime set in the typical fantasy/medieval world, where magic rules everything, evil warlocks are on the rise and wizards (with practically zero actual physical strength) form guilds and fight for loot and glory. One of those guilds, Fairy Tail, is famous for its specialty, which is destruction and is the guild young
                  ...
Lucy Heartfilia wants to join. Welcome to a world of  action, romance, comedy, wizards, demons, undead, dragons and all sorts of monsters in a medieval fantasy (kinda) setting!

Where Fairy Tail truly shines is getting you to sympathise with its characters. Do keep in mind that Fairy Tail's PROTAGONIST is Lucy, the female lead, and not Natsu, the male lead. From start to finish it is Lucy's thoughts we hear as the narration and not Natsu's. We also see things from Lucy's perspective. In other words despite Natsu being a powerhouse, the view of the world we get is from a 17 year old very vulnerable girl, for whom we naturally feel more sorry  when she gets her a$$ kicked (aka every episode). Do keep in mind that no Shounen has ever had a female protagonist before (even if all the main beating is still handled by the male lead). Naturally other characters attract our attention equally (ok not equally, more like 50% of the feels we get for Lucy), who all must make sacrifices, have tough decisions to think over etc etc. 

Say Sakura was in danger. Are we afraid? No, because she's a woman, we already know she's not going to get hurt. Chichi? The same. Nami? Well duh... Rukia? ... Ok she might actually get hurt but she's no female, she's just a male who happens to be more focused on agility than raw strength, Kubo needs to work on that a bit. But when it is Lucy that's about to be hurt (and believe me, that's the rule rather than the exception) we're all hanging from the edge of our sits (specifically I'm hanging from the edge of my 380 dollar leather revolving armchair while you're hanging from your IKEA furniture that your mom bought for your birthday). And since the women in Fairy Tail are in fact subjects to their mortality we actually are worried and feel for them. 

And here's another shining moment of Fairy Tail: Constant danger. When Mashima got our awesome mythology he got the whole package, including warlocks, necromancers, dragons, demons and all sorts of other monstrosities. Ignoring how plain AWESOME having these things animated properly is, the villains also usually display the cruelty and ruthlessness you would expect of them, and despite almost everyone having a final goal, you will soon notice that most are in it for the kicks, or are just plain sadists. This is especially true when it comes to women, who usually display the most cruelty (specifically when beating the crap out of Lucy) and to be honest, I'm perfectly ok with that. With the whole plot revolving around wizards known as ""Dragonslayers"" and the creations of the ancient necromancer/warlock Zeref, you can expect some epic fantasy situations to start hitting the fan almost from the start. Oh and before I forget:

-Dear Asia, I want you to describe what dragons are like.

-They are wise ancient serpents with no wings that symbolise the power of nature, the inner peace of water and the harmonic balance of the universe while their mustaches just add to their natural wisdom.

-Good Asia, now I want you to tell me what you see Fairy Tail doing.

-W-W-Wild r-r-rampaging...

-WILD RAMPAGING BEASTS THAT WANT TO STOMP, BURN AND EAT US ALL, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MOTHERF$%^ING DRAGONS! And f$%"" your g@! a$$ mustaches! 

""Cough"" Lets just leave it at ""ep 192 was freaking awesome.""

And since soundtrack is the Alpha and the Omega in my book, naturally I can't help but say Fairy Tail gets 10/10. With a wide variety that starts from tear-jerking dramatic tracks (usually when something horrible scars Lucy for life) to the techno-beats that play during battles, Fairy Tail knows has an awesome soundtrack that it uses almost perfectly (ok not Bleach levels, but still...). Listening to ""Black Wizard's Wicked Heart"" and others is one of my favourite ways to get hyped when playing dota or making games (that and drinking Monster Absolute Zero). The voice acting follows right away with the voice actors not-about-to-die ""cough, One Piece, cough"", and for the most part fitting perfectly. The openings are almost all amazing, with many of the endings deserving applause (especially ending 18: ""Don't let me down"" and the one right after that, ""Chasing"" were both 10/10). The visuals naturally follow through, with the style slightly reminding of One Piece only better.

Well, not much to say about it, by far one of the best settings in shounens, amazing soundtrack that gets you hooked up, plenty of things you've against in MMOs in all their deadly glory and touches of romance every now and then to spice things up. Definitely worth its time."

                                      (8/175 eps)","Now let me preference this by saying that I have only seen 8 episodes of Fairy Tail so far, so for all I know the show could get much better. Just look at this as first impressions for the show. Maybe in about a couple of months I might give Fairy Tail another try. Now with that said Fairy Tail is one of the most generic shonen anime I have ever watched.

During the time of this review there is the BIG 3 in anime. They are shonen jump titles that have a large following not only in Japan but also in America; they are Bleach,
                  ...
One Piece and Naruto. As Bleach comes to its end and Naruto begins to slow on the breaks many shonen shows will try to take their place in the BIG 3. There is Hunter X Hunter (which I have never seen), Blue Exorcist (still, never seen), and Hajime no Ippo (you might notice a pattern now...) but the one show that has pretty much taken the spot of Bleach is Fairy Tail.

So about a year ago I got into anime. I had always liked anime shows but never truly knew that they were anime. The shows I loved were Dragonball Z, One Piece and even Naruto. I still somewhat enjoy these shows today (okay maybe only One Piece) but because of this I figured walking into Fairy Tail would be a nice fun piece of cake. So one day I searched Fairy Tail on YouTube and Funimation had about 40 episodes up so I decided to watch 10 episodes to give the show a try. I then began to watch the first episode…..

Now I remember asking myself multiple questions after the first episode. Like, were the main characters introduced at all interesting? I mean Lucy is a walking piece of cardboard pretty much with Natsu there to give the best Monkey D. Luffy impression he can do (seriously, no else notices how much he acts, talks and eats like Luffy?). Lucy has nothing going for her except tits but besides that all the female characters have this problem. In the big world of shonen anime males rule so Fairy Tail tries it's best to make Natsu and Grey look as cool as possible. There is also Erza but she is fan service that just happens to be strong. Also even though all the characters can use magic how come they only use one type of magic? I mean if you could use breath fire and summon other worldly beings you would be well off but learning other magic would not hurt right?

The story seems to so far have the problem that Bleach had and that most bad shonen have and that is that there is no real long-term goal to achieve. With One Piece it is for Luffy to become King of the Pirates and for Naruto it is for Naruto to become head of the village. So far in Fairy Tail it is threat comes up and the group solves it. How can an over 130+ anime episode show have an overall plot this paper thin? It also has a major problem that I had with Naruto. In the first episode of Naruto, the title character becomes a ninja. The problem with this was that there was no internal struggle to become a ninja. Same with Lucy in Fairy Tail, she wants to become part of Fairy Tail and boom, first episode alone she joins. In doing this we don’t see how much the characters truly want to follow their dreams because they are practically handed them in the first episode alone.

The show looked nice but nothing really caught my eyes, with characters looking good with nice looking scenery. The fights looked cool I guess but overall One Piece came out years earlier and looked much better than Fairy Tail. The opening for the first season was okay with no great animation with a generic as hell song to boot, but I enjoyed the ending only because I am a sucker for a catchy electronic tune. The overall music for the show I did not pay very much attention to, since it was just the same melody every time a fight began.

By the end of the eight episodes I frankly had no interest in watching anymore of the anime. I just started watching Baccano! And never went back. I know that the show has a large following and I don’t want to offend any of its fans but come on guys! This is popular enough to be part of the BIG 3? A five year-old could have written the show! Recently though many fans of the show have been complaining of the repetitive nature of Fairy Tail so change could happen I doubt it. I would not tell anyone that considers themselves mature anime watchers to consider Fairy Tail, but for younger viewers getting into anime I guess it's an okay starting point.


FINAL RATING: Mediocre- Fairy Tail brings nothing new to the table, but fans of shonen might like the bland but like-able characters."

                                      (74/175 eps)","Okay so Fairy Tail recently ended so I thought I might as well write a review about this shounen anime... Like any shounen anime, there is always one who is meant to be the strongest of them all... Like Bleach being Kurosaki and Naruto being ""Naruto"" and Fairy Tail being Natsu... And there are other supporting characters that grow strong with these strong protagonists such as Lucy, Erza, Gray and the other characters... Fairy Tail is at times hilarious and the art is, in my eyes, good, being a very popular anime, the art is heavily focused. However, there are many pin points in Fairy
                  ...
Tail which are not being focused on when they are supposed to be...
________________________________________________________________
Story: The story is very generic and simplistic like any other shounen anime. It is overrated in a sense that many people exaggerate too much about this anime... From my perspective, the story is very mediocre, the story arcs are very short and does not develop much tension and feels to the stories. I am not trying to say the arcs should be about 100 episodes long but Fairy Tail goes in this sequence:""Heres an enemy, defeats him, the team gets stronger, we win"" A heavily repetitive sequence in Fairy Tail...

Art: Nothing to comment of... The scenes shown in Fairy Tail has been adapted from the manga very well...

Sound: The soundtracks of Fairy Tail is okay but does not make the audience feel as much tension as it is needed...

Character: The major flaw in Fairy Tail is the character and their development... Like shounen animes, for example Katekyo Hitman Reborn, it is shown clearly that the protagonist and the supporting characters are getting ""stronger"" in a way that their attacks and skills looks improved and have much more impact... However, in Fairy Tail, this is not applied... Fairy Tail has shown Natsu look too strong with its first appearance that all its fights look boring and simple with all his attacks being small fire breaths and fire punches and kicks... And according to Erza, Natsu is getting stronger but all they apply to him is more scales or darker face appearance...

Enjoyment: Comedy, one of the very important aspect of Shounen anime, as most of its audiences are young children... To appeal to these children, comedy is a must which obviously Fairy Tail has, but its comedy is no different to that of other shounen animes... It's good but it's a very generic comedy which most anime also has... 

*NOTE: This is a review of my own... Views may differ as not all people have the same opinions*"
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Mixed Feelings,"Fairy Tail... Where do I begin? First, I just want to tell you not to be thrown off by the scores. After all, I did decide to watch this anime even though one of the reviews gave it a 5...! 

The thing I liked most about this anime was the Music. The beginning OST, and ending OST's  were beautiful, and they were by far some of the best! With that said... The second thing I liked about this anime was that the fighting scenes weren't very long. Most lasted about 2 episodes maybe 3, and the very Important ones were maybe 4. If you're
                  ...
thinking that's a lot... Go watch One Piece, those battles are SUPER long, although I was okay with it because it was interesting. It's all a matter of preference, but I felt that the short battles worked for Fairy Tail. That's the other thing I like about this anime. It doesn't really drag things around. It just cuts right to the chase, which again works out wonderfully for the anime.

As every anime has pros, every anime must also have cons... The thing I disliked THE most is originality... The writers/producers had no originality in the battle system whatsoever. By this I mean, that every fighting scene could be summed up easily. The ""hero"" lays the smack down on the boss, the boss ""powers"" up, and then beats up the hero. The ""hero"" talks about not letting his friends down, and then somehow gathers enough power to defeat the boss...! Almost every battle scene is like this. After a while it gets annoying, but it's something you can bear... At least for now. Another thing I didn't really like is character progression. I saw none of that, and it really upsetted me! For 175 episodes the characters BARELY progress! By progress I mean emotionally, skillfully, etc. Their's NO character progression at all, but as the Manga is not complete yet,  maybe we'll see some character progression later on...

Overall, I give this anime a solid 6. While Music, and simplicity were great about this anime, what really hurt it was tthe fact that It was a little TOO simple, which led to little originality and that led to no character progression. I do urge you to try it, as it does have its good moments! Thank  you, and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"Ah, gotta love the masses and their love for mediocrity. Fairy Tail (FT) is from the pilot chapter/episode an average shonen series and yet it is loved by many for being just that. I guess rehashing notions from Naruto or One Piece can make a success out of anything. Because just like those shonens, FT has superpowers, adventure and a big cast of colourful and eccentric characters that occasionally get focused upon and fleshed out. Nothing we haven’t seen before but, hey, if it worked before why wouldn’t it work again?

Because it’s WORSE!

It is hard to talk about anything in this show without feeling like
                  ...
I am just stating the obvious or just describing a different shonen. For to be honest, there is approximately zero innovation in this work and it just walks upon the path others paved before it. It can work alright but it will never stand out on its own; it will forever be just a rehash of already established formulas that have been attributed to others at least a decade earlier. Not only that, but the show rehashes them in a watered down way to the point it becomes a Saturday morning cartoon.

THE STAFF
- Animated by a collaboration of studios A-1 Pictures and Satelight. The first usually have very good production values and the later have low. What they have in common is how most of what they have made over the years is mediocre and forgettable.
- Directed by some nobody who never made something significant in his whole career.
- Based on the manga by Mashima Hiro, whose only previous major work was Rave Master. In case you didn’t watch that show, I advise you not to do so; for it’s a completely generic, aimless, boring, and incomplete series. Plus you can easily see that Fairy Tail is basically its improved remake, reusing the same character archetypes and feeling. In all, the mangaka is not much of talent for anything past creating mediocrities.

PRODUCTION VALUES
- Art and animation are rather crude for the time the show was made. The most obvious fault is how they use repeated footage during summons and attacks, an element that is in fact absent from fighting shonen and better affiliated with mahou shojo or mecha. It is a very striking weakness that alone makes it seem lazy compared to others shonens.
- The initial episodes had really jerky motions and many complained how the characters didn’t look or behave at all like in the manga. For an adaptation that is NOT trying to be a spin off but a direct adaptation, the first impressions they offered was the middle finger. They improved it later on a bit but the damage was already done.
- The setting lacks characterization. It doesn’t seem to stand out from the lot like others do, which again makes it hard to be remembered in the long run. Unlike other famous shonens like Naruto or One Piece, there is no theme in the FT world and it passes by as a generic fantasy realm.
- The character figures are again nothing memorable; most are basically counterparts of people from other shonens, so again it has a problem being remembered for anything. As for the more eccentric-looking ones, they are somewhat original for their looks but they are all minor characters that are defined by a quirk and are defeated and removed from the show in just a few episodes. And of course we have most of the girls running around half naked and acting like they are in permanent heat. So this is a cast you will be staring at for the bizarre or sexy way they look and not because they have any special charisma in their personality.
- A minor thing that irritated me a lot. They placed Plue as cameo, a creature from Rave Master. Now what did that manage to accomplish other than annoying the average fan? Is that their way of telling us even clearer that they are rehashing other works INCLUDING their own? That is really tasteless. I hear he was placed there to please the fans of Rave Master but I don’t believe that. Who still likes that boredrome?
- The music part leaves me with very little to write about. The OST is fitting for such a series but I don’t find any memorable songs in it. Voice acting is ok too with what is going on in the story. No amazing performance though.

SCRIPT

The story is completely generic stuff and easily the weakest part of the show. It plays out like some MMO game, where you join a guild and take seemingly irrelevant to one another missions, while at the same time leaving a few openings for character colorization and world-building. It all plays out quite childishly and there isn’t even an objective for anyone in this show; they just take missions and hope to find something that interests them in the process. For example, we know Natsu is looking for a dragon but did he actually look for him? No, he is just fooling around in his guild and takes part in whatever mission comes along.

The scenario ends up driving the characters and not the other way around; and even that happens in a bad way since the heroes are not actively doing anything. They just fool around until a villain or a mission appear out of nowhere (no foreshadowing at all) and just decide to take part in the whole thing for money or to save some girl. That makes the protagonist and his gang completely boring since they have no goals in life to go for without some world threat standing in the way. Heck, they would probably be sleeping all day long if they had no obstacles.

Now it is true that many events lead to character immersion and reveal more aspects of the world, but all that don’t add anything significant to the show. It’s like drawing more hearts around a short love letter; the contenct is the same but just looks cuter. The plot is always predictable, since it repeats in the exact same way all the time with no interesting plot twists or memorable events. Some character’s past is revealed, some old enemies of him appear, some sinister plan of mass destruction takes place, and then the heroes storm in and win with the power of friendship. Thank you very much; I have seen it all before and in a more mature form. They also add nothing to the show besides more cardboard characters with no significance or moe sancy areas you will never see again.

As if that wasn’t enough, just like with all perpetual on-going shonen the anime reached the manga at som point and the creators had to turn to slower pacing, fillers, and eventually to cancel the show prematurely in the middle of an arc. Not that it would be any different if they did what the Big Three do to bust our balls with 10 fillers followed by 2 canon episodes of snail fast plot but the show is left incomplete. Not that there was much of a plot to care for...

If there is something good to say here is how all the arcs are relatively short and with a fast pace to the most part. Unlike most shonen, FT does not try to stretch each arc too much. Of course technically most battles are dead time, since they offer nothing to the plot, plus are predictable and repetitive. So to the most part you are still watching a show which repeats itself faster than the average of its kind and is mostly canon filler.

CAST
The cast is eventually the meat of the show, since the plot is mostly about somebody’s past creating problems in the present. This way you feel like everything is revolving around them and that they are not irrelevant to the main problem of each arc. Some of them count as cool and fleshed out to bother paying attention to but don’t try to find unoriginal characters because you will be disappointed. They are all following a rather typical demeanour but at least they do it right to the most part. There is variety in personalities and powers and most have a rather basic but sufficient backdrop to work with.

Of course they are still shallow as heck; their personality can fit in two lines including their signature move. So the mangaka had to resolve to keeping all the girls half-naked and in constant heat in order to keep the viewers/readers from realizing that. For a show that aims at children, I must say there is too much fan service in it that is there specifically to distract you from thinking how stupid it is.

Needless to say, don’t expect any drastic character development to take place since most of whatever the characters learn in one arc, is immediately forgotten in the next. They keep trying to make you believe they are gradually getting stronger but you can never see that on-screen. In fact you never have a clear picture of who is stronger and by how much, much less where he excels enough to be able to defeat opponents who are in overall more experienced. So how do all the battles resolve if there is no balance then? Oh come on; you can probably figure it out immediately; it always comes down to the power of friendship. To hell with strategy, planning ahead, learning from your past mistakes, or even paying attention to your injuries. Just storm in and win against all odds with the almighty POWER OF FRIENDSHIP! I MUST PROTECT MY FRIENDS! FRIENDSHIP MAGICALLY HEALS MY GRAVE WOUNDS! FRIENDSHIP BRINGS EVEN THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE! Yes, get ready to eat up a lot of this baby food, for the whole plot runs purely on this sort of fuel. Needless to say, it is stupid, overdone, and eventually tasteless.

LEGACY
The series is aimed at younger teens; even younger than the target audience for Naruto or Bleach. There is a lot of silliness (more than the usual) and violence is really basic and mostly bloodless. And of course nobody ever gets killed, or in the rare case he does, he doesn’t stay dead for long. It is by no means a serious show and nothing in it feels important after awhile. Just to give you an example, it has a mascot in the form of a cheery blue flying cat named… Happy. Imagine a scene where some demon prepares to blow up a village full of people and the camera suddenly zooms to Happy’s permanently happy face. Yeah, the excitement vaporates right there. It is very hard to be interested in whatever the heck is going on when everything looks so easy going and silly. In fact the boldest thing in this show ends up being the fan service around the girls and even that is completely basic compared to your average modern ecchi comedy.

So is it a good show? No, but it’s a good time killer if your expectations are low and you are not older than 15 with prior experience to other famous shonen. I doubt it will leave any mark in anime history or be remembered as anything more than a rehash of other works. It does it right but at the same time it lacks the unique feeling every show that aims to be loved needs. It is indeed nothing but a fairy tale; shallow and for little kids who still tolerate the power of friendship is the most awesome thing ever. But it can be enjoyable just for that.

Oh, and I might as well add how FT became one of the Big Three shonen, after the Bleach anime was discontinued. That may seem like it’s supposed to be awesome enough to deserve such an honor but in reality it is only because modern shonen are crap. It gets some value for that but it’s otherwise only the best looking trash of the garbage bin. And the funniest part? Now that it is discontinued as well, there is nothing to replace it. Yeah, hard times...

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"Do you want to see an anime with the worst fillers since Naruto? Do you love characters with so much plot armor that they survive everything? Is an anime with overpowered fire breathing mages, driven by nakamapower your thing? Are you a fan of a heroine whose most significant characteristic is... her boobs (literally, she's useless). This overpraised battle-shounen has been made for you.

~Story~ 3/10
This anime has nothing that's original, nothing. It seems to be a combination of One Piece (nakamapower), Naruto (stupid fillers), Highschool DxD (boobs) and a little bit of Mars of Destruction (the awesome and original characters). Our story starts with Lucy
                  ...
Heartfilia, who's some weird kind of Pokemon master (with big boobs like we already mentioned). She's not strong. Or smart. Or anything at all. But what she can do, is pretending to be pretty while being saved by her friends. She then meets Natsu, our favorite fire breathing plot-armored motion-sickened retard (seriously, does this guy even have a brain?). He's an annoying combination of Luffy and Naruto. He has one new aspect: motion sickness. He gets a lot of random power-ups because of... well, plot convenience. Natsu is a member of Fairy Tail, a magic guild which only causes trouble, but which hasn't been suspended by the council yet, for some reason (the council is totally useless in this anime anyway). He takes Lucy to Fairy Tail, and she joins their guild. They then embark on a journey to find... Natsu's father. Who's a dragon. (Yes we know, this anime doesn't know logic and it clearly doesn't know the story of the birds and bees either, deal with it) They get into trouble several times, and in each of these a sad past of a Fairy Tail member is revealed. Because if you don't have a sad backstory, you can't join Fairy Tail. Watch our characters take on a much stronger opponent every arc, but still defeating them after a nakama speech. Also, watch some really interesting villains turn good after a battle (seriously, we could give you a ton of examples of this in this anime). And then comes our main villain... Zeref. And watch him... whine? Why is he even here? He doesn't serve any purpose, right? I thought they were looking for dragons? Do they find the dragons? Will Zeref ever stop whining? Watch this anime to find out. Oh wait. You won't find out. Maybe in the sequel, bitch. For real though, the premise of this seems promising. The first arcs were actually okay and the world building was fine, but they decided to use the same formula over and over and OVER again. The pacing was pretty bad at some points too. If the magic had been more interesting and was explained more, it could have been a lot more enjoyable. But after some time, the story just wasn't interesting anymore. It was repetitive, and the characters made no progression in achieving their main goal at all.
[CONCLUSION]
The story was weak, and full of nakama power. Just what we needed. It was also repetitive after the fifth arc or so. This anime is so popular, and the fanbase is so large, but why? There are way better shone anime out there, this anime is average at best. The premise was interesting, but everything turned into a mess with our heroes defeating the ""extremely powerful"" villains over and over and over again... very entertaining, especially after the tenth time.

~Art~ 7/10
The art of this show is pretty good. It looks like a magical shounen anime's animation. Exactly what it is. The animation changed over the years, the animation of the first episodes is really different from the animation of the last episodes. Especially the character designs of the women, their boobs grew every 10 episodes or so. Great job creators, is this show aimed at horny teens or something? The animation is colorful, and let's be honest, the battles look pretty awesome now and then. The animation isn't very special, it's quite generic, but not ugly.
[CONCLUSION]
The animation is plain but it serves its purpose.

~Sound~ 7/10
Fairy, where are you going... Yeah. Most of the openings in this anime were pretty decent (and catchy too). They were a bit too happy to our liking though. But you shouldn't rely on our opinion too much, taste in music is very subjective after all. The OST's in this anime were actually good.  They matched the scenes and they were easily recognizable as Fairy Tail OST's. The endings were okay too, though nothing special.
[CONCLUSION]
The music in this show was pretty decent. The best aspect of this show in our opinion.

~Characters~ 2/10
This cast is so original. Nope. We have an overpowered, nakama motivated, plot-armored hero and he has a cute animal as a sidekick. The main heroine is weaker than the main hero (again: so original), she also has big boobs (this is like the 847394th time we're saying this) and she is constantly saved by everyone. She also gets a lot of random power-ups, because this is a generic magic battle shounen. We also have Gray, Natsu's rival... VERY original. Oh, and before we forget: he likes stripping, because man service is exactly what this show lacked. Yes, this cast sucks. But then there's our savior Erza. Oh wait, no. She's a tsundere who always fights with the main characters. But then she also has a sweet side and has a weird obsession for cake. And last but not least, a cute loli, who is totally useless: Wendy. She has one of the most annoying sidekicks ever: Charles. There are a few interesting characters (hence the 2/10), e.g.: Mirajane, Gajeel and Laxus. But they didn't get a lot of screen time, and the rest of the characters were just generic and boring.
And may I have your attention for... the worst cast of villains ever created! Our first serious villain turns out to be Gray's adopted brother and... turns good. Our second villain didn't turn good, but his henchmen did. Welcome to Fairy Tail, Gajeel and Juvia. Our third villain actually kills someone... and turns good after that. And the guy we're talking about REFUSES to die, because he just keeps appearing. Another villain, Laxus... also turned good. It's not even funny anymore. Oh, yeah, we almost forgot about the main villain: Zeref. Who's a whiny retard that does absolutely nothing in these 175 episodes. Worst villains ever.
[CONCLUSION]
Hahaha. This cast is so bland and boring. We didn't care at all about these generic characters. And the villains are on a whole new level of stupidity; everyone turns good (or in a love interest). This cast is really bad, the only characters that were well-developed were Mirajane and Elfman (the problems with getting over a certain traumatic experience), but this show is called Fairy Tail, so the makers decided to bring a certain person back. Good job!

~Enjoyment~ 5/10
Especially during the first arcs, this show was quite enjoyable. The story was neither deep nor really interesting, but the jokes were funny, and over-all it just was something light to watch. But when the story progressed, it got so repetitive. A simple repetitive story + horrible characterization = Fairy Fail. (Sorry, I couldn't contain myself) However, we do disagree with those who scored this show a 1/10, because that's not fair. This show definitely isn't good, but it's not a 1/10 when it's below average. It has some promising concepts and the animation and music were decent. It's just that it could have been so much more. However, we disagree with both the diehard fans and the diehard haters.
[CONCLUSION]
This could have been good, if it didn't get so repetitive. But it is what it is: an under-average boring magical battle shounen. If you love this genre, or dislike good anime, then you might like this show, but if you prefer something with decent characters and a good story, then watch something else (some personal recommendations: Fullmetal Alchemist, HunterxHunter, Gintama). So please know that you'll be wasting your time if your expectations of this show are high. It's your own time, so we can't tell you what to do, but we recommend you to not watch this anime filled with boobs, nakama motives and blue flying cats. Peace."

                                      (76/175 eps)","This is my first review here.So be prepared for a mess of a review.

Inspired by my friends,lured in by the hype,fooled by its huge popularity and high ratings in MAL,I entered the amazing world of Fairy Tail.MAL ratings are usually right,so I genuinely believed this was going to be a memorable show.But alas!I was hugely mistaken.I could never predict the trainwreck I was heading towards. 

This show started off very promisingly.The first few episodes indicated that this was going to be an awesome adventure show.It had all the ingredients for the making of a great show.All it needed was good execution.And this is where it
                  ...
failed miserably.Bland comedy,pedestrian fights,needless fanservice and most importantly,excessive use of deus ex machina,which is an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation since the writer cant come up with a believable solution,all this things add up to the clusterfuck of a show that is Fairy Tail.


I am no stranger to battle shounens.Infact,my favourite anime is a battle shounen.This is one of the reasons why I decided to stick with this anime.But as the story progressed.the show only went to one direction,downwards.The quality of the show dropped harder than Chelsea's league standing last season.I thought I was not in the right frame of mind for this show.So I took a short break and put it on my on-hold list.But alas!It turns out it was a mistake to put it on hold, I should have put it where it belonged - in dropped..

When I again picked it up,the show didnt improve a bit.I was around 70 episodes by then.The only thing that kept me going for so long was it's ridiculously high MAL rating.I was like a pray wrapped by an anaconda,slowly suffocating to death.Then I finally decided to commit a Taboo.I decided to drop this show for good.This show remains the only show in my dropped list upto this very day.


And the reason I gave it a 2 and not 1 is because it taught me one valuable lesson.No,it didn't teach me to solve everything by the power of nakama Bullshit.This show taught me not to be deceived by the huge popularity and high rating of a show.And thus,I am drawing a conclusion to my rant.

Feel free to give your thoughts in the comments."

                                      (11/175 eps)","Ive been reading the manga around since chapter 8, and i must say, fairy tail is the 2nd anime that i watched since my 2 and half year break from anime. (besides watching gundam 00 s2 and code geass r2 when it airs)

so far, till ep 11.

My list of criticism: 

Sound:
- i must say, it is a disappointment to me that natsu's seiyuu is one of those who seems to have a serious tone as from my experience of reading the manga, natsu is more of a character like one piece's luffy and should therefore have a seiyuu with a lack of serious tone majority
                  ...
of the time like luffy's. 

- in the first ep, when hearing happy's voice, i was totally disappointed. the aye sounds so lame here..... its too high piched however, after 5 eps or so you get used to it.... so i guess its okay

- lucy's voice is okay but not the best

- erza and gray voice = good choices

- The background music is, i must say, rather unfitting many times. it seems like they just put in some chorus out from nowhere when there's a battle scene, not to mention that the chorus didn't do a good job -- it didn't fit

Art:
- The art, i must say, is rather disappointing too. I have absolutely no idea why the heck they create those magic circles everytime the characters casts magic. And on top of that, the action scenes is a big disappointment -- Fairy Tail is obvious a action themed story, however, there is too much talking and too less action when there's suppose to be action and when there is action, it feels like im watching barely moving CG's.

- Why the hell theres a dragon that appear whenever natsu use any move?!

- As a major fan of Erza, i am disappointed by how her character design changed so much in the anime. When one compares her design from the anime with the manga, one can cleary see that her hairstyle and eyes design changed a lot! It seems like shes a totally different person -- it is too lively, shes more of a serious type. And her adult like beauty is lost... Also, her hair color is too bright crimson. It is suppose to be dark crimson....

- I am disappointed with Gerard's hair color. It is too bright! his hair color is obviously dark blue with some tones of sky blue. However, instead it became totally sky blue. 

- The fairy tail guild tattoo being completely colorful is annoying me. In the manga, it is mostly shown as fully black in the color pages, and i must say, that's better than being so colorful.

- i was disappointed with the scene where natsu and happy thanked lucy for the food. It seems to that the scene in the manga is actually more funny...

- seems to me that they tried to add in the facial effects from the manga --- those totally wtf faces (with big black eyes and etc...) however, this is not a manga and they pretty much failed with it. I mean heck, they just put that in for 2 seconds and thats it.... not funny... unlike the manga... they did a bad job on that...

Story:
- This is another typical shounen type good vs. bad story. It is not as good as one piece, but the story is faster paced than one piece, which is slow as hell. However, Fairy Tail is obviously better than Bleach and Naruto. Also, it is a disappointment that Hiro Mashima's previous manga made anime Rave Master sucked. I hope fairy tail don't end up like that.


spoiler:

i have no fckin idea where in the manga did erza became known as ""the knight"".... it sounds so lame, i mean, her nickname erza the titania sounds way better"
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Mixed Feelings,"Fairy Tail is an anime with nothing special or groundbreaking. If a character is in a dangerous situation, power-ups come to their rescue. If they want to give a motivational speech and get even stronger, they talk about the power of friendship and save the world. Their plot armor is so thick no god can kill them. This is a sin shared by many anime, but Fairy Tail overdid it.

The anime successfully creates its own world, introduces characters with different abilities. One Piece has pirates and devil fruits, Bleach has Soul Society and bankai, Naruto has ninja villages, and Fairy Tail offers a guild system.
                  ...
Guild members work shoulder to shoulder trying to save humanity once again. Where the anime fails is the execution. 

Fairy Tail’s biggest sin is power creep. Characters continuously power up, beat their foes, save the day, hot girls with boobs of the size of the moon fall for them. Any difference between characters in terms of power is sacrificed for plot convenience. In HunterxHunter, for example, we at least know the limits of characters. We know that even main characters cannot mess with certain enemies. But in Fairy Tail nothing is impossible for the main character. The reason? One of the characters says about Natsu, the protagonist: “Natsu-san gets more powerful when facing strong foes.” This means that there’s no point of enemies and other characters. Natsu just needs to face the enemy in order to defeat them. There is no point to the story.

Fairy Tail tries to compensate for its shortcomings with endless fan service. Big silicon-filled boobs embellish every scene. This is the most fan service filled shounen out there. Unlike One Piece where female characters miraculously grow fatty glands in later episodes, in Fairy Tail they are there from the very start. We are showered with lots of skin. Lots of buttock shots, lots of sexy women. The anime treats its fans like testosterone factories. 

Another problem with the anime is that it has a lot of pretty-face characters that don’t contribute to the story. After watching all 175 episodes, I still don’t get why most of the guild members are there. Go and kill half of them, the story will lose nothing. Go kill the remaining half and the anime will improve. 

Fairy Tail does everything in the book, throws every gimmick in the book at your face. It fails at most of them. It ends up as a caricature of itself, with lots of wasted opportunities. Plus, it has 35 filler episodes. In other words, one episode in every five doesn’t contribute to the story in any meaningful way."

                                      (10/175 eps)","Its quite simple really.  The manga's brilliant, but the anime's just another cheap shounen piece of shit........... I might have been pretty harsh to rate 4 parts of the anime all 1's, but i had high expectations and they just murdered the chance of it being an incredible show...."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Fairy Tail is an above average shonoun anime series. It's based on a great manga series, but it does fall a little short of the Manga's quality. However, it is fun to watch, and the characters really do make it what it is. If you like shonoun, then this is a must see. 

My score of 8 is disregarding the ""filler"" that is in the series, though the filler isn't that bad for the most part. There is a noticeable difference in quality when filler takes over. If you are a fan of the Manga and haven't tried the anime then you might be a
                  ...
little disappointed. If not, then you should find this to be a fun series that has its own little charm.

What is Fairy Tail? Yes the ""Tail"" is how they spell it, and the usage of the word is addressed at one point during the story. In a nutshell, this is a story about mages in guilds that battle each other. There are different kinds of magic, and most mages specialize in one type. It is more or less medieval themed, and the main male lead character is trying to find a dragon (his ""parent""). The story holds strong themes of comradery and friendship. It's about finding strength by being a part of a guild, and Fairy Tail is more of a rowdy family than an organized guild. They are always destroying towns by mistake and just getting into lots of trouble while saving people. It has a lot of good messages embedded into it, and it's also filled with lots and lots of comedy.

The anime holds to the overall feel of the Manga for the most part, but falls short on the quality of the artwork. It tends to be a little ""cartoony"" which takes away from it a bit. There are a lot of inconsistencies throughout the series in the animation and artwork, but it's easy to ignore with all of the zany and comedic scenes. 

The music is pretty catchy and works well, and the voice acting is a little above average. There are plenty of cheesy moments, but it all seems to be on purpose. It is overly cheesy at times, but then they come back around and hit home when they mimic the Manga a little more closely. I can't use the word ""inconsistent"" enough when talking about this anime series.

The story is great, and it's the story that smoothes the inconsistencies out. I love the story in the Manga series, and they don't butcher it too much in the anime. I have definitely seen far worse adaptations. They have interesting but predictable plots throughout the duration of the show, but it really is fun to watch despite that fact. 

What makes Fairy Tail are the characters. Natsu is one of my favorite anime characters, hands down. He is the motivational character of the series that drives the others to do their best. Again, he's not as cool as he is in the Manga (by a long shot), but they hold true enough to his character in this series. Every character has their comedic moments, but the anime really does push that trait a little further than its source does.

The series does end before it should, the manga is still ongoing but the gap was closing between the two fairly quickly. They do end it with a ""to be continued"" so there must be plans for some form of continuation because most series just end with a black hole. 

I know I keep saying Manga this, and manga that.... but if you like this series and you haven't read the Manga then you must read the Manga. It's a fun read, and it is a much higher quality. Even with that said, I will repeat what I said before about this being an above average shonoun series, so I do recommend it."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Fairy tail is a show about magic and friendship (some might say, too much friendship)
I see all the bad scores and the bashing that the anime gets, and for that I will try as much as I can to protect it.

I admit, the story in fairy tail isn't that good. But the light heartness of this show, the interesting plot points that we discover and the great fights. Fairy tail is a fun show, it's fun to watch it, it's fun to talk about it. People take this show very seriously and I think this is the problem.

While the main character, nasu, is you might
                  ...
say the ""averge shounen hero"" doesn't mean that he is a bad character. He hold high values of his friends and he cares a lot about people close to him. He is a great guy that you can't really dislike. He has his own moments that make him different for other shounen MC. We also have charaters like erza, who will show the people that ""girls aren't only fit for kitchen"". As a guy who saw a lot of anime where the girls treated as weak and fragile, this is a refreshing female character!

The fights are simply amazing. There is lots and lots of powers who will keep your head glued to the screen. Even if the outcome is most of the time predictable, you still can enjoy the fights very much.

Although the animation is not very good, the art is amazing. The character design of hiro mashima is absoulute beautiful, and let's not forgot the amazing soundtruck, I believe everyone can agree that the music in fairy tail is very good.

In conclusion, I believe that people should just relax, sit back and enjoy this anime. Because once you really start to just enjoy and stop looking at the bad side-you will discover a great anime."

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"You know, it takes a certain kind of skill and finesse to create a genuinely interesting universe along with intriguing characters and an adventurous setting, then screw that up entirely as the story progresses.

Ah Fairy Tail, you and Hiro Mashima have done what I had thought to be impossible. 

Story: Where do I begin? The show starts off very interestingly, I'm forced to admit. The magic is interesting, I can't lie. Dragon Slayer magic, Elemental Magic, Requipping, and the Zodiac gates are all well done in the beginning, enough to pique my curiousity. And then of course, as I said before, it slowly progresses into
                  ...
utter nonsense.

So we start off with Lucy Heartfilia being inducted into Fairy Tail by Natsu Dragneel, and we get intros of the main group -Erza Scarlet, Gray Filibuster, and Happy- which is the focus of the story.

Were I to give you a brief summary of all the arcs in the story, you would think, 'Well, that sounds interesting'. There are three arcs that introduce recurring characters, whilst simultaneously attempting to flesh out the protagonists. There's a sort of civil war-esque arc for the control of the guild, the introduction of Dark Guilds and world threatening schemes and hyped up villains.

So why does Fairy Tail 'suck'? Because the resolution to almost all those fights is by the 'power of friendship'. 

And this increases throughout the series, to the point where it forced me to drop the series at the finale. I kept hoping, praying even, that the story would improve, that sometime soon, they would meet a true challenge.

But no. Every antagonist they meet is hyped up to the point where there literally was a 'God Slayer'. But wait. There was also a leader that was touted to be leagues above this, and would you care to guess how he was defeated? 

He was beaten by a character that was literally said to be weaker than another fighter, but got a power up out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. No training. No previous indication. How, you ask? Because Hiro Mashima, I answer.

It kept deteriorating even after that, impossible as it may seem. My personal favorite was when for the sake of humor, they sacrificed the time they needed for training, and then got a massive power boost from previous antagonists. It makes you wonder, if that was the case, then why didn't everybody from Fairy Tail just get some? Heck, why didn't the powerhouses get some, at least?

But wait, it gets even worse. The season climax, also the point where I dropped the series, was when SPOILERS     the protagonist beat two antagonists who were touted to be the strongest fighters of a rival guild. By himself. At the same time. Just... Just no.

Story: 1/10 (The one is for the potential) 

Art: The art is quite good, I'll admit. The animation however, is pathetic, to say the least. 175 episodes and they couldn't even bother to spend some money to pretty up at least the main fights. Honestly, the fights in Fairy Tail are like watching animated slideshows from visual novels. Actually, that would be better.

Art: 3/10 (Because the Magic circles are nicely done.)

Sound: Surprisingly, the sound is very nice. Some openings are very well done, much like the endings. Background music is also nice, along with the combat music. The effects could be worked on, in my opinion.

Sound: 7/10

Characters: Pathetic. That one word is enough to describe all the characters in Fairy Tail. I'll give a few basic descriptions.
Natsu: Interesting start. Devolves into pathetic nakama loving lucky moron.
Lucy: Interesting ability. But is eventually made a fanservice character for the most part. This also applies to the Zodiacs she summons.
Gray: Rival to Natsu. But sadly, not given nakama powerups.
Erza: Strong, independent, and also fanservice. Think Quiet from Metal Gear Solid.
Happy: Why does this abomination exist? Why? What purpose does this thing serve? Why? Why, Mashima, Why?

Props to Mashima for making the most badass character, Mystogan, also the most pathetic one.

Characters: 1/10

Story:
It starts with a young girl named Lucy Heartfilia, Lucy is a cellar mage looking to join a guild, preferable the guild ""Fairy Tail"", the anime starts as she is in a town where someone claiming to be ""Salamander"" is using forbidden magic on all girls to make them fall in love with him, so Lucy as well, at the same moment Natsu and Happy searching also for ""Salamander"" (a different one) come rushing in and break the spell, in
                  ...
exchange she pays them food and the seperate. Afterwards the bad mage comes back and claims he's part of Fairy Tail and invites her and other woman on his ship, but there it seems he's part of a Dark Guild and she gets captured, when Natsu hears there's a guy pretending to be a Fairy Tail mage he rushes in to her aid and in the battle it gets revealed Natsu is the real ""Salamander"" (again another lol to many in) and a Fairy Tail mage, after the battle is done he takes her to there guild, and this is where the adventure begins.

Sound:
Fairy Tail's Opening and Ending's theme song changes every 13 episodes, so you understand there has been quite some music alrdy, most of these songs are very catchy and absolutely great to listen to, also the background music is very good it changes at the mood and at what character is in screen, if I'm right there are so far 3-4 ost's out alrdy so you can imagine the various sounds that is being heard.

Art:
I always loved this animes art but there are a few minor things wrong in it, at the start the battle parts barely got truly animated and where more picture flashes, second you notice when it's a filler or a less important part in the anime, the quality of the art just goes down...

Character:
I gotta say any character in this anime can be taken to you're like there's quite some different types of characters that's why I say this, and more and more keep coming. Let's say for an example Natsu is a hotheated but very kind and always fights for his friend type, while Lucy is more shy and very determined char, then Erza... oh god Erza, the woman the man! actually a woman, leader, hotheated... err everything in 1, sorry just trolling around.

Enjoyment:
Anyone who likes allot of action pared with hardcore comedy will enjoy this anime, also ppl that look for supernatural anime will take a liking into this. I hardly ever been annoyed in this anime at all and that's just because the characters itself make me smile rlly well every single time again :)

Overall:
Must watch anime, if you didn't seen it yet... yet at all I'd say don't wait any longer because you'll regret it, it's absolutely something you don't wanna miss ^^"

I knew going in that this was a shounan anime that would at some point become stagnant.  Basically, it's just a rehash of dbz-type plots.  Over and over, the difference is that there isn't any real Kurosaki-kun type evolutions and not much in the character development department.  It's a good guys always win show that goes to short lengths to make it painfully obvious.  So it kills what little suspense a show like naruto has in the buildup.  

The story is paper thin and seemingly has no direction except when
                  ...
the bad people show up and the fight scenes take up their dominant role as the unmoved mover.  The last 3 arcs are virtually identical in plot lines and yet, there hasn't been much change to the characters, and in some cases, no change.  I didn't vote for Obama but c'mon, I'm not chopped liver either.

Art could be better, Sound, is there music?  Guess it isn't memorable either way.  Characters are semi interesting, after 100 episodes their former merit runs a little dry.  The enjoyment is above average, because I'm a sucker for this type of show, even if I complain.  And it's really just filler for the next installment of One Piece.  

Overall, if you like the big 3, bleach, naruto, one piece, then you'll definitely like this.  It's a different flavor that goes it's own way, which is exactly why it isn't the big 4."

Initially I take 10 persons who watch anime and I suggest them fairy tail .And 7/10 loved this anime . and the reasons are as follows .

1st person - it was his first anime
2nd   ""     
                  ...
 - he watched 8 animes in total
3rd person - he didn`t watch many animes with the art style of 2015-2018
4th person - he watched about 20 animes 
5th person - he is a fan of magic animes
6th person - he watched 50 animes 
7th person - he watched 10 animes 
8th person -he didn`t like the name 
9th person- he hated the art as he watched the recent animes
10th person he watched more than 100 animes

so, by arranging in such a order that the first 7 persons liked it we observed that ,this was the best anime for those who just started anime or those who are fans of magic fantasy anime.

Therefore, people that watched tons of animes already, might not like it .so you can`t blame the anime for being bad .

Story: 3/10
The main plot is actually pretty interesting (especially if you are into action-role playing video games). The whole thing about having a guild, taking up jobs and go on adventures was really interesting. But then, as the series continue, it became too cheesy, super cliche, focused on ""shippings"" and giving off fan-service.

Art: 7/10
It was okay. The characters look a bit younger compared to how they look in the manga but it's okay.

Sound: 5/10
There were lots of ost that was used in this series but I only got 1/2 songs
                  ...
that I actually liked and remember, the rest were just okay - although I skipped most of them after listening to it once. The sound effects were good though.

Characters: 6/10
At the start of the series, the characters were all interesting. They are funny, cute and really adorable but then as the series continue, they became boring and overly dramatic.

Overall: 3/10

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"I watched Fairy Tail without having read any manga nor having any knowledge of it's theme or plot prior to starting the series. What got me interested in it was very simple and had nothing to do with what the series is about - I watched it because I found out one of my favorite avex trax artists, BoA sang an opening song for the 2014 sequel of the series. I started before the song was release, it was only just announced.

I have to say that I'm glad I decided to watch the show. I didn't know what to have expected but it was surely
                  ...
interesting. I'll say this. The ideas for the plots for the different arcs in this anime are surely interesting. As for the execution, that's a bit iffy. Why? Because I have to admit that it can get really cheesy at times. But it's the method that makes the characters grow on you, so when something devastating happens you feel it. You have to embrace this anime for what it is. It goes through the typical rise and fall, where the bad guy beats up good guy, then good guy comes back stronger and beat up bad guy with the power of friendship and perseverance, etc. I bet many would find that too cliche and redundant, but like I said, to enjoy this you have to embrace this for what it is. And that is what I did. I never read manga or knew anything about it prior, so it wasn't very difficult for me to do so. I didn't have any expectations whatsoever.

Once you do this, however, you will see the excellent stories and how they come together. At first I felt the show was a bit childish for me then I realized it became way more interesting and intense and had me thinking and crying and laughing. One thing about this show that stands out to me is that EACH character (and this is no exception) has a particular behavioral trait that is unique to them and I found this very interesting. There are SO many characters this anime it's ridiculous, but it's good to have and maintain a sense of variety.

When you get into this anime you wont be able to help but root for the protagonists. Their sense of individuality is also what kept me continuously watching. LOL Also, it took me to the end of the show to realize that Lucy was the main character hahahaha."

                                      (109/175 eps)","This anime, when I first heard of this, made me feel giddy inside since I love MMORPGS. Guilds and magic and fantasy setting. I felt for once hat I would enjoy watching an action packed anime again. I'm starting to think now... why did I even bother watching this anime?

I feel ashamed for watching this anime and getting into it. It was appealing at first then left a flavour in my mouth that was left by several other animes. I won't name anyone specific, but when you watch the show for yourself, I think you'll understand.

STORY

Roughly the story is about a girl who desires to
                  ...
be part of a guild. Could basically just substitute guild for clique. Any ways it follows the adventures of this young girl fitting in to a guild, seeking guild jobs to pay for her rent and bills and such. She meets another guild member and decides to tell him her dream of joining a guild named Fairy Tail.

After the introduction of several characters, you begin to understand all the mechanics of how the guild works. A few arcs later you begin to feel  as if some of these 'arcs' are recycled from other stories. I felt like i was being ringed through multiple different series before an arc was finished. What is sad is the whole guild concept would work well if their was a little more...um... originality?

There is some arcs that revolve around a lot of the characters and start out well, but the shows target age is very evident.
5/10

ART

The art didn't stand out for me. It felt similar to other animes. Nothing innovative or spectacular. Just what you would expect from a typical shonen. I felt the art style could have been better. Something a long the lines of Naruto. Naruto felt more fluid. Fairy Tail just felt like an outdated anime. Some scenes felt like the 90's. There is nothing here really to talk about.
4/10

SOUND

This has been my ONLY fascination of the whole series. The music and the one sound effect they always play when a prank is being pulled on someone. This kept me watching it, even though it felt somewhat immature or childish. The emotional music made up for this a little bit. The main theme song is something that will stick in your head, but you won't feel angry or upset it is playing over and over again.
The other sound effects are OK. The dubbed voices could be better. A lot better. 8/10

CHARACTERS

I love the characters personalities. I find them each so unique and I love them for it. But everything else I hate. Some characters even feel like a copy and pasted character from another series that already existed before this series time. Even the clothing in some episodes is beyond uncanny. 

Even though I like some personalities in the series itself, I also found an equal amount of characters I hate. Usually, with series I predominantly like, the favourable characters out number the disliked. This is a young persons series through and through. It reflects a lot among the characters personalities and their back stories.

The characters abilities in the series are somewhat disappointing. Even at times there is a sense of overpowered-ness, which I dislike A LOT.
2/10

ENJOYMENT

This is an age specific anime series designated for those shonen teenagers. If you are not, then it could appeal to those MMORPG gamers in a less serious way. I found this series to be more over hyped then then 3 other anime series that end to be near the top for Shonen lists.

This anime doesn't have that appeal of sucking you in. It lacks self confidence. I felt like it was half done at times. it felt empty although at times it was too colourful and loud. 
5/10

I really wanted to enjoy this series. And I did have a moment or two where I was excited. But that lasted for 2-3 episodes out of 100 or so. The rest felt liked watered down scripted material of a kiddy western cartoon. 

The characters are very stereotypical and didn't offer much to the supper plate. it could have but it didn't. Physical character designs and stereotypical personalities just doesn't cut it for me. There seemed to be very little originality that went into them which sucks since the concept of a series based on a guild looked flawless on paper.

Although the series is below average for me, the only thing that was well done exceptionally was the music. It was all catchy and fun to listen too.

Final Verdict: IF you fit the target audience and/or like MMORPG guilds, this MAY entertain you for a while or in small table spoons. Otherwise, find some other fantasy based series. This one lacks... pardon the primitive language, but... balls.

Fairy Tail had a lot of potential. Tons of it. The story is amazing, and the characters are very well done. What screws it all up is the progression of the story. Things ALWAYS turn out for the best, which gets very annoying at a certain point, because it makes the anime less exciting and more predictable. The most annoying part of it is the amount of times the heroes save the day at the last second. I honestly can't even count the times all the heroes have already used
                  ...
up all of their magic, they are all beaten down, but somehow, someone, usually Natsu, manages to summon amazing strength to defeat a seemingly unbeatable opponent. It makes for a very predictable story line.

The animation is very decent, although almost every female character has gigantic breasts in it, which you may think is typical for an anime, but here it is way way more common, and they don't even make the effort to conceal it.

I did enjoy watching it for the most part, however all the deus ex machina moments in the anime made me feel very frustrated. It could have been done much better, and as I have not read the manga yet, I don't know if the writer or the producers are to blame.

I give this an 8/10, because it is a very easy anime to enjoy."

When watching FT you shouldn't compare it to any other animes.

Fairy Tail wasn't meant to have a incredibly deep story line. The creator Hiro Mashima wanted this and stated this.He wanted a more light hearted story.

The 1st couple of episodes are relaxing, to get you into the feel of how the guild and the characters are.  The story gets more serious and deep with each arc. Each arc is different from eachother and have a variety of unique Characters.The arcs are short, but every arc is longer than the one before.

Some members of the guild: Natsu,Lucy,Erza,Gray,Happy,Carla, Wendy,Cana
                  ...
etc. Have interesting backstories to them and get featured in the Arcs. Some Characters get developed from time to time.

Whats different about FT is they let background characters have their time to shine and feature them in some arcs.
The magic possibilities are endless with each character.The character designs are unqiue and appeal to the eye. The anime has bright colors and is very different looking than other animes.

The fights are quick and get right to the point and are not dragged out.
The anime usually gets a 2 Chapter:1 Episode ratio so The anime is fast-paced.

This anime is not for everyone. If you are new to FT don't expect it to be like One Piece. FT is very different than One Piece. FT is not to be taken too seriously, its more like I said its lighthearted with action and interesting plots.Things don't get interesting for a while so it may seem boring for 10 episodes.

                                      (172/175 eps)","Alright, I should be studying, so I'll make this quick.  Here goes my first anime review!

Fairy Tail is overall a good anime in the sense that it has a great combination of action, comedy relief, and romance (but not too much), which is really why I've continued to watch it for so long.

However, as time progresses, the quality of the show begins to decline.  The plot is introduced early in the story, but progresses VERY slowly.  Unfortunately, this causes the show to feel very repetitive and pointless.  There were times when I forgot there was a plot, and the series reminded
                  ...
me of some American cartoons where each episode is totally unrelated to the next (except FT is in arcs).
172 episodes later, I'm still asking the same questions I did when the plot was first introduced.

Aside from that, the animation is pretty good.  The artwork is pretty modern and doesn't feel old or outdated.  I'm very picky about how the characters of an anime look, and this series is very pleasing to my eyes.  However, there are a lot of still frames... and the fighting scenes could do with a lot of improvement.  Battle scenes in Fairy Tail are nothing close to the wow factor of Bleach (or maybe even Naruto).

One thing the producers of this show are really good at is ending an episode.  Each ending always leaves me unable to wait for the next (except for a small amount of exceptions).  I always find myself going, ""OMG, what's going to happen?!  Why do I have to wait a week?! *facepalmpullhaircrycry*""

One of the things about this series I can say nothing bad about is the music.  I absolutely love it!  The main theme sends me chills, and I often find myself rooting for Fairy Tail as it plays.  Sometimes I feel like I, myself, am a Fairy Tail wizard.  What got me hooked was the way the directors ended each episode... something would happen, the picture would freeze, and then an AMAZING ending song would begin to play with that picture before the credits appeared.  I don't know why, but I find it beautiful.

The summary:

Pros:
1. Good balance between action, comedy, romance
2. Good artwork
3. Good episode transitioning
4. Amazing music

Cons:
1. Weak/Slow Plot
2. Unexciting battles
3. Repetitive theme
4. Long, unexciting fillers

Despite the cons, Fairy Tail is currently my favorite anime and the ONLY anime I'm watching."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Sorry its so long! But I still didn't cover a fourth of everything that happened in this anime.

When I first saw this anime, i wondered whether not I should watch it. With a name like Fairy Tail it sounds pretty lame, right? Wrong. Fairy Tail is absolutely great, and almost everyone who has seen this anime or read the manga will agree with me. 

So, what's it about besides a guy with pink hair named Summer(Natsu) running around breathing fire, and a talking cat named Happy? Its about a blonde hottie named Lucy Heartfilia who is a Stellar Spirit Mage (summons spirits based on constellations).
                  ...
Her dream is to join a mages guild called Fairy Tail. Obviously, she get's in pretty quick, its what happens afterward that matters. She meets people like Gray Fullbuster, a ice mage with a habit of stripping naked, and Erza Scarlett, a freaking powerful warrior mage who does some pretty weird things. A cute girl named Wendy Marvell (introduced further into the anime) who gets easily flustered. Fairy Tail contains a plethora of unique characters and personalities, each one just as refreshing as the last. 

So what's the main plot? Well one of the main questions throughout the anime is what happened to the Dragons? Each dragon had a certain element, and raised only one child. Natsu got fire, Wendy got air, Gajeel got Iron, and each one has the ability to eat their element to gain magic power. However, the Dragons all disappeared July 7th, 777. The question of what happened to them is brought constantly, and is the reason why Natsu and Lucy meet, but it is not the main quest. 

This anime doesn't really have a main quest. Instead, it has story arcs, each of which are events that happen to the guild, or are adventures that the characters go out on as requests.As a guild, Fairy Tail receives requests that the guild members go out and complete and get paid for. It is through these requests, and random events that give Fairy Tail its story and the characters their backstory. Nothing similar ever happens twice. There is always a sense of suspense during every arc right up till the end.

I love watching this anime and its characters. Right now, Fairy Tail is on Hiatus as the voice actor for Lucy has personal reasons. I am re-watching it to refresh my memory of the story, but now is also a great time for other people to start it if you want to get caught up. I hope you enjoy this anime as much as i do!"
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Fairy tail is in my opinion, the best shounen anime so far. Yes, your eyes are not tricking you. I said it. Fairy Tail takes all your knowledge about how a shounen anime should be and throws it out of the window of a 50 floor building. It's nothing like Naruto, One Piece or Bleach. The story is about Lucy Heartfilia, a 17 year old Celestial Wizard that wants to join Fairy Tail, a wizard guild famous for its free spirit. Along the way, she meets Natsu Dragneel, a Fire Dragon Slayer nicknamed ""The Salamander"", and his partner, Happy, a blue flying cat. Being members
                  ...
of Fairy Tail, Natsu and Happy introduce Lucy to the guild, where she becomes an official member. 

The plot is the main reason Fairy Tail has a certain number of haters. All shounens have an axis for the story to progress right? Fairy Tail hasn't got one. Being a wizard guild, Fairy Tail members take jobs assigned by people in order to have an income. Therefore, every arc has little to no relation with its previous one. Of course there are references, but they are only minor and have little to do with each arc's plot. Also, all of you that are used to shounen anime, you know how a battle must last for several episodes right? Well, that's not the case in Fairy Tail. You know how characters take hours to explain their fighting moves? Forget about that. 

When it comes to the animation's quality, you might find it a bit low in episodes that are less important and exist only for ""filling"". In arcs however, the art is beautiful, detailed and magnificient. Compared to its nemesis, One Piece, the difference is easily noticeable. Soul Eater fans might find a small resemblance in the styles of these two. 

When it comes to music, I believe it's the best compared to all shounen. The background music is impossible to remain unnoticed and helps a lot to put you in the mood. It's a mixture of Irish and Japanese tunes with rock elements. It sounds weird and possibly a failure, but believe me when I say it's incredible. Given that the anime is somewhat medieval-based, the soundtrack fits perfectly. The main theme is incredible and you will find yourselves watching the openings for the scenes and mostly, their music.

The cast is enormous with a variety of secondary characters. If you thought that there would not be enough screen time for them all, you are terribly wrong. As expected, Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray and Erza, the main cast, are the ones focused the most. However, everyone else will be on the shot many times while their backgrounds and relationships will be explored as well. The voice actors are also amazing and possibly, the youngest compared to the other shounen. 

Fairy Tail has everything. Moments where you will have enormous feels, where you might shed a tear watching the pain the characters are in. Moments where the comedy will make you burst laughing. However, there are times where things will get serious and mature. When it comes to action, there's a ton of it. The battles are unique and most times reach an epic climax where buildings collapse and the landscape gets torn apart from explosions. However, Fairy Tail is famous for the huge amount of fanservice it provides. But I will not say more, you have to see for yourselves.

Fairy Tail is not perfect. Like all shounen, it has flaws, but there are some really good elements too. I consider it the best shounen because it's nothing like you have ever watched, it breaks the rules about how a shounen must be and shines where many anime fail. After a two year gap, the anime will continue in April. You've got plenty of time to watch it and read the manga if you'd like. I strongly reccomend it.

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Magic, power, friends, guilds, and fights - Fairy Tail.

The anime revolves around a guild named Fairy Tail. The guild has a close bond, strong members, and a handful of enemies. Magic such as wind magic, fire magic, summoning magic, all sorts of magic can be found in this anime. It's the typical shounen anime similar to One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto.

Before automatically stating that this anime must be a ""copy"" of One Piece hear me out. In theory, you could say every shounen anime is like One Piece; Fairy Tail is not an exception. However Fairy Tail is just as similar to One Piece, as
                  ...
Bleach or Naruto is similar to One Piece. The difference is Fairy Tail focuses more on plainly fighting, emotional moments, and ""friendship"". 

Story 9/10: The story of Fairy Tail is pretty basic, there are different arcs for different scenarios. It's what goes on in the story/plot that makes the anime awesome.

Art 7/10: The art is not that high quality, probably due to the large amount of episodes and of course budget/time. The characters are all attractive/appealing to look at which is a bonus.

Sound 10/10: I really like the OPS/EDs, and two of the characters in the anime are very good singers.

Character 10/10: The characters are really great they make the anime. Their emotions and personalities are what makes the anime shine. The characters voices, attitudes, and abilities are always interesting.

Enjoyment 10/10: This anime is a joy to watch, I could easily watch all 175 episodes in less than a month. The anime is quite humorous, exciting, and sometimes emotional.

Overall 9/10: Personally, I find this shounen anime much better than some other older shounen anime's because of the character's personalities. They aren't robots, or in a strict society where they must act a certain way with demanded respect etc. They're themselves and I'd much rather have watch an anime with relatable characters than an anime with dull senseless characters."

Character (2/10):  Warning...This might turn into a rant.  Ugh...I'm sick of Natsu and Lucy.  I can't handle watching another episode with them in it.  Let's talk about Natsu.  Shall we?  He's obviously the guy who charges into fights instead of using his head.  Natsu somehow KO'd every single boss even though the bosses can obviously beat him up.  When
                  ...
all seem lost and our hero is losing...FRIENDSHIP BEATS EVERY SINGLE THING. *sparkle sparkle* Even if our hero was stabbed to death (for example), the power of friendship would somehow heal his wounds and make him powerful enough to beat Mewtwo.  (Yeah bro, friendship is Uber/OP now.)  It would be nice if they let Natsu lose a battle for once and learn from it to show that we all have to lose at some point.  We can't just win constantly.  Now we're gonna talk about our little dear Lucy...She is weak without her ""spirits"" and keys.  If she lost her keys, well guess what?  She'll just stay at the sidelines and do nothing when her friends are in need.  Not even a punch!  She also takes credit for what others did.  Sure Lucy, you were there when your friends saved everybody, but that doesn't mean you also deserve the praise when you actually did nothing.

Enjoyment (3/10):  Transportation jokes aren't funny.  Especially if they use it in almost every single episode.

Overall, it's a 3 for me.  In the end, I dropped it.  If I didn't like it, doesn't mean you wouldn't.  If you think you'll enjoy it then watch it!"

Story (5): 
The story is the weakest part of the anime. From the first episode you know that Natsu, one of the main protagonist, wants to find his friend/guardian Igneel. But after the first episode, it seems as if he doesn't care anymore. He doesn't go out looking for him or anything. Also, after every story arc, there's another. And it each of the arcs are predictable and very similar to each other. Also, the story makes
                  ...
it confusing to see who's the real protagonist, Lucy or Natsu.

Art (10):
The art is amazing and visually stunning. It's a great anime to look at. It has the classic anime/ cartoony look to it. Each character has a lot of details to their clothing and their abs. The art gets even better when the characters use their magic. But even though the characters are drawn well and have a lot of details, it seems they were lazy on SOME of the backgrounds and city. And most of the female character's body parts are very exaggerated. But the art is phenomenal overall.

Sound (10):
The sound effects are great. Every time there is an explosion or anything, the sounds make it seem legit. There's not a lot of things you can say, but it is outstanding overall.

Characters (7): You have a large cast here, but some of the characters seem so bland. Natsu doesn't have much character development. He seems so overpowered, but he gets travel sickness. And a lot of the other characters are one dimensional. But Erza is a strong female lead. she's one of the most interesting characters of the series. She is very driven and strong. Lucy also has a lot of personality. Even though many characters have flaws, they are still fun and great to watch.

Enjoyment (9): I will admit, even though this anime has its flaws, it is still such a fun anime to watch. It is very funny and the art is enticing. It is also great to marathon when you are bored. You can get hooked on it easily.

Overall (9): I can see why it is one of the most popular anime today. Although I think it is over hyped at times, it still is a great anime and is worth checking out."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I have just finished this series after a long series of doubts. It's the first time I see an anime that exceeds more than 63 episodes (and yes I am referring to FMAB).
Now I consider myself a fan of this anime.

Story: 6/10 because it tends to be repetitive. You find an enemy which wants to hurt humanity in some way, or conquer the world. In the end it is defeated by Natsu & co. and in 60% of the cases they turn out to be Fairy Tail's allies in the future. 
Enemies appear for no reason, when an arc is over (enemy boss is defeated)
                  ...
you get about 3 or 4 filler episodes and then, an enemy pops up. Somehow it gets related to Fairy Tail and then you know the story.
However it's rated at 6 because arcs are good, even fillers are good. My favourite arcs are: Tower of Heaven (Jellal), S-Class Exam (Tenrou Island) and Grand Magic Games. I dropped some tears at some point, but not because I was sad. It's the emotion you get from the fights and the history behind them. 
Keeps the protagonist's objective though. Igneel's search tends to be mixed in every arc as you get reference from someone talking about dragons or mentioning them.

Art: 7/10, animation was good. Pretty well done, colors dance in the screen as you watch a fight between a fire mage and an ice mage (red and blue), and what I most liked about it was the perfect contrast and combination that was notorious in the characters clothing/hair. Natsu being pink-haired and having a black and orange suit with a white scarf, and Lucy with her golden hair and white/blue clothing. Wasn't the best animation you are going to see, but its definetely worth enjoying. It gets better as you watch the anime, you can notice that at Ep 16, fx and animation aren't the same than Ep. 155.
What really got me about art was Natsu's fire mixed with the animation, it was really well done, I mean, it looked like real fire. Gray's ice was beautiful definetely.
I almost forgot detailing how beautiful Magnolia is. 
A really well done job. Not the best, but nicely done. 

Sound: 10/10. Strong point. This is one of the main reasons I started watching Fairy Tail. Music is absolutely gorgeous. Sound effects are great too, not to mention the seiyuus' work on this anime. Every voice fits every character perfectly. It's not the case that you see a giant ogre with a tiny voice. 
If I were to talk about music, I wouldn't end, so I will be brief. If you don't get excited with the song ""L'Luvia"" (the theme of the character Juvia Locksar), or ""Sannin no Duragonsureiya"" (The three Dragon Slayers), you aren't human. My favourite piece of music is ""Gray no theme"" (the theme of the character Gray Fullbuster), it makes you really want to fight. ""Happy no theme"" (the theme of Happy, the blue cat) gets you ready to see something really funny. ""S Kyuu Madoushi Shoukaku Shiken"" (the theme of the S-Class Mage exam) fills you of pride. My opinion about this is that the OST is perfect.
Moving to the OPs and EDs, they are wonderful. Almost as good as the OST.

Number 1 Kangepiku no ne, by Watarirouka Hashiri Tai.
Number 6 Be as one, by w-inds.

Character: 10/10. Another strong point. You learn who is who, quickly. I was never in the situation of ""Oh, who was this guy?"". Everyone at Fairy Tail guild is important, of course you have the protagonists and later on, main characters. The ""Fantastic Four"" as I call them, the ones you see in the picture of Fairy Tail here in MAL, are the protagonists. There is other important people at the guild however, strong mages, funny people (which leads to bizarre situations), and of course the master. You are going to love them and hate them, you will embark on a trip of emotions with this characters. Even the villains have their own background that may make you feel that, they just were not evil at all. 
One little point against is that there is a lot of characters. As I said before, I never forgot anyone of them, but there is just too many. A lot of Fairy Tail guild members, there are another guilds, and then a lot of villains (keep in mind that there are 15 arcs, and each one of them presents approximately 6 or 7 new persons, if they are not re-used.)
The anime is seen from the point of view of Lucy Heartfilia, one of the main protagonists, although sometimes it is seen from Levy McGarden, a mage of Fairy Tail and a friend of Lucy.
I never get tired of watching them, specially during the filler plots, where you see their non-fighting personality.
I liked most of them, to the point of rising my favourite character number to 10.
Had to split them in Men and Women.
And so, my favourites are:
-Men
Gray Fullbuster
Gajeel Redfox
Gildartz Clive
Natsu Dragneel
Jellal Fernandes

-Women
Elsa Scarlet (Elsa is the correct spelling of the name, in japanese. In english we are used to see her name as Erza).
Mirajane Strauss
Juvia Loxar
Aquarius
Kana Alberona

You will find more about this characters when you watch the anime.

Enjoyment: 8/10.
I don't rate it at 10 because of what I said when talking about story, it its repetitive. I am ok with filler plots, but when there is one arc filled of reused villains that again get easily defeated, you tend to get bored. However, when in between arcs you get those 3 or 4 filler episodes, then you can call yourself happy, it is really great to rest from a lot of fights and explore the Fairy Tail universe a little more. I got bored only when an episode was really silly and had nothing to do with any arc.
Now that I have finished the anime I can't wait to start reading the manga and watch Fairy Tail 2014! It's re-watching worth is medium. I only re-watched episodes that had good battles or character development, or precious music usage.
I consider it one of the animes that I liked the most, but not one of my favourites. However, it is an unforgettable one, the fond you grow with the characters as you watch the episodes is great, making it harder to forget this anime.

Minna-san, I hope you enjoyed reading my review."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I usually just rate animes on my own list, but since I haven't watched a long anime series in years and this is one of the most popular animes, I'd thought I'd do my first review.

One of the most amazing things about this anime is the guild that the title comes from, Fairy Tail. Fairy Tail is a guild of magic users that go out on jobs to put there magic to good use. However, they find themselves having to save the world many times. 

The guild members have such a strong bond that they are like family and they are willing to do anything
                  ...
to protect each other and the guild's name. A really admirable trait about Fairy Tail is that their conviction is so strong that they make some of their enemies become their comrades.

Another great aspect of this anime is its four main characters: Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza. All four of these characters are members of Fairy Tail. 

Natsu has the power of a Dragon Slayer, a fire Dragon Slayer to be exact. Seeing it in action is very cool, especially as Natsu's power gets stronger. He is impulsive and a little full of himself sometimes, but he is also very caring toward his friends.  He doesn't have much character development as a person, but he becomes a good influence on some people as the series progresses. 

Lucy is a Celestial Spirit Wizard who uses quirky spirits based on the Zodiac. She is beautiful and smart, but she is a little weak as a magic user at the start of the series. However, her kindness towards her spirits gradually help her get stronger as a magic user. As a person, she also gets stronger as she confronts personal issues with her family.

Gray has ice magic that can form different things as an offensive force, like a hammer or an animal. Throughout the series, he grows as a magic user and a person as he confronts and his past and learns new moves.  He becomes a good influence on some people and honors his magic teacher. His backstory is poignant and sad, but also engaging to watch.

Erza wears armor and a sword that can requip itself to different types. She is cool because she is physically strong and beautiful. She gets personal growth as she confronts her past, learns new moves, and meets new people.  As the series progresses, she shows a vulnerable side, a feminine side, a quirky side, and a maternal side. Like Gray, her backstory is sad, poignant, and engaging.

Besides the main characters, the secondary characters are very good. They are very numerous, with different abilities that are either interesting or really cool. My favorites included Mirajane, Gajeel, Master Makarov, Loki, and Happy. Some characters get some development, but there are too many for anyone to be fully developed.

Alongside the main and secondary characters that made up the good guys, the bad guys are an interesting bunch. All of them have cool abilities to watch. Furthermore, I ended up pitying some when they showed humanity, loving some when they became Fairy Tail's comrades, and hating some when they were just cruel and evil.

In addition to Fairy Tail the guild and the characters, the soundtrack is fantastic. Combining Celtic-folk and rock, the composer Yatsuharu Takanashi created great battle themes, character themes, and themes for various places and emotions. I have several tracks on my ipod to listen to for pleasure and for exercising. I will always treasure the slow version of the anime's main theme.

When it comes to its flaws, the only ones lie in its animation and its plot. Sometimes, the animation could be beautiful, especially when it comes to certain places and scenery. However, there are times when the animation looked too CGI for my taste. 

As for the plot, it is really formulaic. It has Fairy Tail discovering bad guys, fighting and defeating bad guys with a friendship speech and power up, and then doing it over again. 

Most of the time, it didn't bother me it because I was emotionally invested in the characters and the guild Fairy Tail. It was fun watching them meet new villains, comrades, and places. It felt like playing a fantasy role playing video game without controlling the characters. However, during season 4, I started to wish the show could explore something else even though some of the battles were great and fun to watch.

Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed watching this series. As the series progressed, I felt like I became a member of Fairy Tail myself. If you want a fun anime with magic, action, and adventure, then I recommend this."

                                      (140/175 eps)","I cannot be bothered putting a huge amount of time into this review so here goes. This anime has great potential, however the execution of the series and the cliche ""friendship"" act gets kinda annoying. It reminded me each time of how annoying I thought Bleach was because of this ""friendship"" bond and out of nowhere they overwhelm the enemy. It becomes especially apparent when they're being beaten numerous times to only come up on top just by screaming louder(DBZ). 

Worst part of all is the fanservice. I used to read the manga, but it has just plummeted to the point where half the manga/anime
                  ...
is now just fanservice of the heroins. Hiro Mashima just leads people on by the romantic component of the anime which again isn't very entertaining. It is the whole ""I will protect everyone"" bullshit that causes Lucy to love Natsu deeper and cock blocks Gray. Nothing special

However, the music in this anime is astonishing. The timing is well executed with great background music to signify the important of a scene of cut to the ending song. Personally, I believe the music the one component of the anime that truly shines. Most anime doesn't have a large array of soundtracks that are used in such a way that actually can invoke your emotions in different ways depending on what they're trying to achieve. I have downloaded many of the soundtracks which I still listen to and enjoy. 

For those who want a generic anime with some funny scenes that even made me laugh until I dropped give this a shot. If you are more like me and prefer intellectual anime this anime isn't going to be your forte. Simple as that."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"After finishing the last episode of Fairy Tail, and then reading a couple of reviews to see what other people thought of the show, I was shocked to see how much negative feedback there was recently. So, that being said I figured I would write a review of my own. 

*skip the next paragraph if you don’t want a summary of the show

First off, the summary of the show, or at least on MAL, makes it sound like it follows the life of Lucy Heartfilia. This is not completely wrong, but I wouldn't say that it is the best way to describe how the show
                  ...
is portrayed. Instead it focuses much more on her friend Natsu who has a rare form of magic know as dragon slayer magic. They both are a part of one of the largest magic guilds known as Fairy Tail, which is how the show gets its name and where all the characters get quests that they complete to make a living off of. The show is divided into many arcs ranging anywhere from about 5-20 episodes each with about 2-3 episodes of filler in-between each arc. While the story does have the ongoing theme of Natsu trying to find his father, it is the quests that Natsu and his friends go on together that make up the vast majority of the story. 

The weakest part of this show would have to be its story. As I mentioned earlier, there is the ongoing plot of Natsu and the other dragon slayers looking for their parents, but in reality that is overshadowed by each of the quests that the group goes on, and the looking for the parents things is just kind of there to keep in the back of your mind while they do other things. That being said each of arcs in the show still have a good story individually, that help build the backstories for all of the characters in the guild. 

Next up is the art. While this shows animation is nothing unbelievably unique that will be stuck in your mind forever, it is still done very well and matches the overall mood of the show nicely. The animators also did a nice job at making the battle scenes look really nice. 
The sound in this show is just fantastic, there is no other way to put it. No matter how many times I hear the music from Fairy Tail I will never get tired of it. Most of it consists of modern renditions of Irish folk instrumentals which have different tempos and melodies to match the mood. The voices for the actors, and sound effects were done well too.

Perhaps the best part of this show is the characters. There are probably about 1000 of them and every one of them is unique. Obviously they can’t give you a fully develop every single one of them, but they give you a great backstories for all the main characters and even the secondary characters throughout the story. While I did complain about the story a little bit earlier, this was the one thing they got right. Instead of force feeding a ton of information about every character you meet immediately, they let you learn about them for yourself through speech and actions and then after you have a feel for them they will usually discover something about that character from the past while trying so solve a different problem. This sounds a bit complicated on paper, but when it all comes together you end the story knowing everything you would ever want to know about everyone, and it was just seamlessly woven into the story. I really can’t say enough good things about how well they developed the characters.

Lastly was my overall enjoyment. When I first started watching this show I really wanted to hate it. To be honest the first arc is kind of bad, and initially I couldn't stand Happy (Natsu’s pet cat) at all. But as I moved on with the show I was able to get past that. The largest complaint I had of the show was in the beginning, whenever someone used magic it would basically stop everything so that you could see the cool animation as they announced their next spell. But thankfully they slowly stopped doing this until they reached the point where the spells and attacks were much more fluid and didn't seem to interrupt the show early in the series before it became a problem. Perhaps after reading all of those complaints I have the show you would wonder why I would still rate it so high. In reality all of the problems I have presented in this review were very small parts of the show (maybe 5 episodes out of the 175 or so) After giving the show a chance I fell in love with the characters and had a great time binge watching the entire thing with a couple of other friends. With that in mind, I would be able to understand why some people do not like this show. It is worth mentioning that while I personally was able to enjoy this show because I thought it had a good balance of tension and humor, if you are looking for some show that has a really deep message, or takes its self really serious, this show is not for you. 

In conclusion Fairy Tail is a fantastic show. It has a couple problems that may take a little away from some parts, but in the end if you accept the show for what it is, you will not be disappointed. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who was looking for a good fantasy adventure, or anyone who simply enjoys the components that make up a good shonen."

I like the relationship between everyone in fairy tail and how they always fight each other as their daily hobby.I think the story is pretty well made and i like most of them like the first few and the magic games.I didnt really like the clock arc with michelle and lucy because i found it quite boring

tbh.I liked it when laxus,gajeel,juvia and some bad guys turning good and fighting for fairy tail.overall i think the show is very enjoyable and fun to watch and the good thing is nobody dies!It gets really sad and emotional when a main character dies like in gurren lagann when kamina died. thats all!

It takes all elements that both suit boys and girls and roll it all together. It has action and battles that is tense and exciting, but don't take too long that you loose all interest. (battle length range from 1/2 to 3 or 4 episodes). It is also a very emotional anime with each character have their own heartwarming story and events that follow it.

Each character is so well developed and each saga brings new and exciting twists. 
Fairy Tail is a good fun anime with loads of that cute anime humor that is just ridiculous but that you love.

Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I'm not a regular anime critic but I decided to share my point of view on Fairy Tail after reading all the negative reviews. I agree with most of them in a way, except I think they can be exaggerated at times.

I started watching this anime about a year back and finished it two weeks ago. I had to constantly take breaks from it due to the story getting repetitive and also took a particular long break from it on a really boring filler arc (since I never skip fillers).

Story: It's a really good concept that wasn't executed to it's full potential. It's not terrible,
                  ...
it's not depressing, it's not sickening, it's... just OK, I guess. There's a lot of ""power of friendship"" boosts and I have to agree they're quite silly, but they manage to make you get goosebumps even after all that repetitive nonsense.

Art: Compared to most of the long anime I've seen, Fairy Tail definitively has one of the best animation and art styles I've seen. Usually, on short anime quality is better than on long ones (and I guess there's a reason to it) but this one manages to keep a really good quality compared to other long anime and the characters rarely look like they have deformed shapes like in Naruto.

Sound: I really, really like this anime's sound. The intros, the background music, the volumes set for FX sounds, voice volume, voice acting... They're all really good. I am yet to find something to complain about in this point. Note that I watched the subbed version, maybe the dub is crappy or something, I got no clue.

Character: The character development could do better. The main characters eventually start getting a lot of development but you gotta watch a lot of the anime to get there. As for the rest of the characters... I think I haven't even heard the last name of like 80% of them if not more. I do love something from this anime when it comes to character creation: Every character has a signature thing they do. Natsu gets motion sick on transportation, Gray suddenly takes off his clothes for no reason, Cana is always drinking, Elfman keeps saying the word ""man""... I could go on for ever but I'll leave it like that. I enjoy most, if not all of the characters. Even though there's not much development, they are quite enjoyable at all times.

Enjoyment: Despite it being too mainstream and having a lot of ""power of friendship"" nonsense, I enjoy it greatly. Silly characters like Natsu and Happy are successful at making me laugh at many given times. The last episode even has a joke that I can still laugh about after two weeks of watching it but I won't be able to say anything about it because every single bit of it is a spoiler. Apart from the funny moments, they do this whole ""power of friendship"" thing in a really good way. I hate this common cliché, yet when they do it in this anime, I can't help but to get excited and feel just like they do.

Overall, I'm rating it 8/10. I find it a bit higher than it should be but the word ""good"" that number 7 gives it is a little bit too weak. If I could, I'd give it a 7,5 or so. That would be a more accurate score in my opinion."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Honestly my first review, but I had to put my two cents into this fantastic anime that gets way too much hate. Fairy Tail is a comedy-adventure show, and never tries to become a well-written or psycholigically thrilling show. It's simply a bunch of powerful wizards in a powerful guild having fun and trying their best to protect each other. 

Simply put, Fairy Tail is easily the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched, and I have watched hundreds of anime at this current point in time. The comedy is phenomenal (espeically in dub), the characters are wacky and fun to watch, and the plot
                  ...
is always interesting enough in each arc. This show will make you root heavier for the good guys more than you usually would, but the villains are still very interesting and extremely underrated. All in all, if you want to watch an anime that will make you laugh all day and night, while also giving you extremely good plots in each arc, watch this show.

People expect way too much out of it, and constantly mention things like the ""power of friendship"" to put down such an incredibly enjoyable anime. The same things you see in this anime are the same things you see in anime like One Piece and Dragon Ball - no one really dies and plot armor is a heavy factor. But that didn't ruin the show for me at all, because I knew to expect that. It's always kids that believe they are more grown up than they actually are - or grown ups that believe liking a kiddish show would be bad for their reputation - that decide to hate on this show. There is a clear reason why this show has lasted for so long, while also having 100 years quest coming soon - because it is amazing. So to all the haters: get ahold of yourself, you probably haven't even gotten up to the Phantom Lord arc but yet you stay hating. 

PS: The Phantom Lord Arc is literally only 21 episodes in. If you get to that arc, and still don't like the premise of the show, then you may as well just drop it."
Fairy_Tail,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not RecommendedSpoiler,"The following review includes aspects from all the anime seasons released thus far. 

Before I start my review, I would like to inform you that I'm writing this review after 3 years of complete loyalty to both the Manga and Anime of Fairy Tail. I used to love Fairy Tail...while I was still naive. I had this rated 9/10 but now, after re-analyzing/re-watching the anime I have realized how poorly written it's plot is and how unnatural the characters seem, it's a 4/10.

First I'll start with the good points: The art (8/10) and sound (9/10).
The art style is very good. I love most of the
                  ...
character designs, the buildings/backgrounds look excellent, etc. and the soundtrack is just gorgeous. But the animation is average and even worse in the 2014 version. The main theme is very catchy and has a unique and epic feel to it. But as far as the pros go...this is it....no wait...excellent, unnecessary fan service (10/10)!!!

You may have heard several Fairy Tail fans say ""If you love One Piece and Naruto, you will LOVE Fairy Tail!"" Don't fall for this. Naruto and One Piece are miles better in terms of plot, action, world building, etc. If you've watched Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, One Piece, I suggest you do NOT waste your time on Fairy Tail. I regret ever getting into this series. I'm being completely honest, I watched/read Fairy Tail more than a year before I even thought about starting One Piece, I promise you that my opinion on Fairy Tail is NOT biased in any possible way. 

The plot of Fairy Tail (3/10) is riddled with inconsistencies in almost every aspect. The setting seems good, vast, exciting at first but it's almost never used. Fairy Tail is the perfect example of wasted potential. The magical kingdom of Fiore, with several strong guilds like Fairy Tail, Blue Pegasus, Mermaid Heel, Lamia Scale, Sabertooth, etc. is ruled by a wimpy, childish, weak king. Why? No one knows. And it looks like we never will (no mentions anywhere in the manga despite it seemingly reaching it's climax) He's also never shown doing anything except hosting the Grand Magic Games. He holds no strength and has a fairly weak military. Literally ANYONE could've been the king.

The plot lacks structure, subtlety,  and complexity. It almost too simple. There is an unnatural contrast between the good and the bad in Fairy Tail. Zeref is the only sensible antagonist to have ever been introduced in Fairy Tail. There is absolutely no foreshadowing or prior information to almost all the major enemies and plot points which I've almost never seen with an anime as popular as this. It's like a new enemy just randomly appears out of nowhere and the plot points where thought of just minutes before Hiro Mashima drew it out onto a sheet of paper. Without spoiling much I can tell you this, only Zeref and Mavis have a proper place in the actual overlying plot. Most characters are not well written and I would have to type in a loooong essay just about that...

Quite a few unexplained plot points. We never got an explanation as to why a Flame Dragon Slayer gets stronger when fused with lightning. (Natsu eats Laxus' lightning and gets a huuuuge power up) Do we just have to blindly accept whatever is stated? Plus why didn't Natsu eat lightning when facing off against Laxus? Seems more like it was made up on the spot than an actual fact, doesn't it?

Face was an extremely strong weapon that was never even remotely mentioned before it's appearance.

More often than not, the protagonists/good guys will find themselves against an extremely powerful enemy, lose to them at first then minutes/hours later tadah..the enemy is down flat like a carpet with absolutely no explanation to the rapid increase in strength. Example? Natsu vs. Zero/Brain, Natsu vs. Jiemma, Erza vs. Azuma, Sting and Rouge vs. Demon Jiemma, Natsu vs. Zancrow etc. 

Power levels are extremely random. If the fights mentioned above weren't enough to prove it, here's more, Gajeel, Gray, and Natsu are supposed to be equal. Supposed to be. But Natsu is always portrayed as being much stronger than these two. He's supposed to be weaker than Erza and Laxus by both hype and rank, yet we've never once come across a situation that proves this right. Natsu has countless times defeated enemies that Gajeel and Gray struggled against...again no explanation..Natsu just becomes stronger and we have to accept that...all hail the unbeatable protagonist! He's only ever tasted defeat against Gray (as a kid) and his mentor, Shanks...I mean Gildarts.

Gildarts is a straight up copy of Shanks from One Piece, barely any differences what so ever...so no point in talking about his absence. He's just roaming around the world even when his guild members are in severe danger. Oh wait....Natsu can handle them, he can be as strong as Gildarts if Hiro wants him to. Explanation is for pussies...

Pointless/random fan service. At first I thought this was an action, adventure, shonen manga...but as the story progresses it becomes more ecchi-centric. You get naked chicks all over the place. The anime actually tries to reduce it as much as possible. In the 2014 version, we see Kyoka torture Erza in a very suggestive way but at least Erza had her clothes on....well she didn't in the manga. 

Character development seldom lasts long. We all felt Natsu's loss when Lisanna died...I mean disappeared. When she came back, it was still a happy moment, nothing too unexplained and bad but it get a lot worse. Do you remember when Lucy cried a lot and we all witnessed the drama when she broke Aquarius' key? Well guess what, *SPOILER ALERT* she's back and all is good...and Natsu is even more reckless after the year time skip..it's absolutely pathetic. It's like he faces no consequences for being stupid and unwary of his environment. 

I would have a lot more examples if I included things going on in the manga right now (as of writing this obviously) but I choose to not spoil the 'fun' for you. 

If you are someone who is thinking of starting Fairy Tail, I suggest you don't but it's only my opinion. You are the only one who can judge it for yourself. If a sensible plot isn't what you need, go ahead, enjoy Fairy Tail. It's got good comedy and flashy fights that look amazing (but seldom make sense) so you could still like it. 

(Plus you get a bonus every other episode, more tits!!!)

If you actually went through all of that, thank you, you are very patient. But there's still a lot more I could've said against this series that I used to love."

Though it took 8 years since 2011 to get to this point, it is all worth it.
Throughout watching this you will find amazing character development, and a story full of revenge, depression, creepiness, mystery, ideology, a bunch of topics that are really well written and amazingly thought-out since the beginning of season 1.

This season hits the hardest,
                  ...
when it makes make you try to connect the dots, somewhere along the story it will reveal something to you, but will it quickly cooks up another mystery so that feeling is not lost.

Shingeki no Kyojin 3 part 2 is a fair improvement from previous seasons but When I think about it 6 episodes in, there are still some issues particularly with the script and characters. 

One of the more iconic scenes in this season is that Levi has to choose to save one from Armin and Erwin, both fatally wounded in the battle. Although I do think the scene itself is handled brilliantly with adequate explanation and enough emotional and physical struggles to render a great impact, it's how the plot progresses to that point worries me. It's crystal clear that when drawing the manga, Isayama
                  ...
comes up with this ""choose one"" scenario first and then proceed to consider how to push the plot to that point, because he does so with incredible amount of plot conveniences and plot armour given to some characters. It's the exact reason why GOT season 8 is terrible and why the story is exciting but also cringe to watch. Heck, Armin somehow survives that burning and over 50 meters free fall, Erwin somehow survives the suicidal charge when he's clearly up in the front, not to mention there's another random soldier who somehow dodged all the rocks just to carry Erwin back. When you realise Isayama clearly comes up with the conflict first then based the plot upon that destination, it becomes incredibly cringe to watch. 

The amount of plot armour given to Levi and Reiner is also a bit too much. Now I can accept Levi has some crazy skills, but when I see him slaying 20 or so titans single-handedly and cuts the beast titan into pieces like a piece of meat, it's a bit too over the top. 

Despite all that, the pacing is great and the story is in this constant struggle-solution cycle that easily keep on the edge of the seat (I've read the manga years ago and still feel quite excited during the ride). Part 2 has some of the best animation in the series especially around episode 5 where levi slays the beast titan. 

Needless to say I do enjoy the first 6 episodes in general, but whenever I think twice about what I just finished, I can't help but to notice some of the aforesaid flaws. Other than that, it's technically 4th season now and the franchise's positive and negative aspects have been discussed numerous times, I don't feel the necessity to reiterate."
Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Bear in mind this is my very first review.

First off, all the plot building and character development truly paid off. In my honest opinion, this is the best season of attack on titan created thus far. 

Story: The story in itself had many twists and turns and many pay offs that did the anime justice. I can’t say much about the story without spoiling, but it kept me on my toes while I watched it. I’ve always been fascinated with how captivating and intriguing the story of attack on titan is, especially with all the flashbacks and memories that truly connect me with the characters.
                  ...
I feel like I know the characters better or I’m able to understand them much better after the fact that I was able to see from a different point of view.

Art: The art style has always been one of my favorites, there are times when the colossal titan looks funny in respect to people on the ground, but the art style nonetheless is one of my favorites. The art style of attack on titan has evolved after each season, only getting better and better with the animation of battles. Especially seeing Levi shoot across the sky fighting titans, which will always be one of my favorite scenes. 

Sound: The opening song isn’t as spectacular as first season’s but the sound quality and voice actors is truly splendid. I also feel that as attack on titan has progressed the sound quality has gotten better. I don’t have much expertise in the sound department, however, I have absolutely no complaints with the sound presented in attack on titan. 

Character: The characters in attack on titan are truly the best characters I have seen, especially after watching Grisha’s life and what he had gone through. It makes me appreciate and relate more to the characters, which is what characters should do. I wasn’t a big fan of Grisha, but after watching his backstory, I was able to better understand why he thought a certain way and I became much more interested in Grisha because of it. I feel the best character represented in this season would be Levi, with all his fight scenes and honestly, his wonderful personality, he truly deserved all the screen time. As I was watching this season, I noticed how not only were characters given backstory/memories but already existing and well-built characters were given even more rich and amazing development. Yes, I’ve read the manga and yes, I absolutely love how attack on titan is one of those shows that doesn’t stray from the manga whatsoever. 

Enjoyment: I absolutely freaking loved this season! I won’t lie and say that most of my enjoyment wasn’t from seeing much more screen time from Levi. The first season of attack on titan is what grabbed my attention in the first place, but this season it truly heated up my excitement for what’s to come. If you love fight scenes, beautiful character development and wonderfully executed world building then this season is a must watch. 

Overall: 10/10 favorite season of all time

Thanks for reading my review, I hope it wasn’t too bad~"

Animation & Art (10/10):
Regular Wit animation (9/10) completed by beautiful artistic style (10/10): that's what SnK S3P2 presents you regarding the art of the show. They knew how to make epic moments more epic using very good animation and excellent... >>

Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Mixed Feelings,"The review as a whole will contain spoilers for the previous seasons. I usually try to avoid spoilers, but this time, the problems are so directly related to the story that I have to address some of the plot elements. Those that have seen the previous parts of the show are safe for now. I will give a warning until I get to the spoilers for Season 3 Part 2.

I actually loved the beginning of S3P2. The first six episodes, for me, were as good as the show has gotten since season 1. We are finally taking back Wall Maria. We will finally get to
                  ...
know the mystery of the cellar. We get the hyped up confrontation with the Armored and Colossal Titans - the one's that started it all. And the ruined district of Shiganshina is the perfect venue for this climactic confrontation. Seeing it again felt really cathartic. During the previous chapters, I almost forgot how satisfying it can be to be dealing with something that has been properly built up and not just hastily thrown at the wall with the hopes of it sticking.

The battle of Shiganshina has a lot of great things going on. Bunch of great heroic moments and lots of incredibly over the top, brutal, action. The beast titan is hurling boulders baseball pitcher style. The Colossal Titan can cause something akin to a nuclear explosion upon transforming now. Much of it is stupid, but it's stupid in the most entertaining way possible. We get epic heroic speeches. Moments of sacrifice. Couple of anticlimactic deaths too, to remind us that it's not all roses and heroism on the battlefield. Very Attack on Titan. The entire injector dilemma was a brilliant and tense sequence. It was so good that I find it difficult to accept that it emerged from the same mind that came up with the atrocious Reiss family story and thought it wouldn't damage the setting. In a vacuum, the battle of Shiganshina is a lot fun. What drags it down, is that it is constantly climbing uphill after what the previous chapters did to the story as a whole. But over all, I would definitely recommend the first six episodes to anyone who has gotten this far into the show - there is no reason to stop before experiencing this.

And then they ruin it. And by ""it"", I mean everything. A lot of dumb stuff happened during Season 2 and S3P1. But it was all still very tolerable. It could have been fixed... or at least you kept telling yourself that. But this was not only the last nail into the story's coffin, as far as I'm concerned, it was also enough dirt to bury the whole thing 6 feet under.

==SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT==

The entire world we have seen so far, is actually a secluded island. Beyond the ocean, there is an evil mega nation of doom that are persecuting an ancient race of people that once commanded the power of the titans. Their preferred method of execution for the descendants of these titans is to inject them with titan juice and set them loose on the island to terrorize the people living inside the walls. The Evil mega nation of doom, that are now being set up as the primary antagonists, are after the vast amounts of natural resources that can be found on the island. That's the spark behind it all! The nazis want some oil! If this sounds incredibly stupid to you... it's because I'm bastardizing it to hell... But also because IT IS!

So, it all took place on an island. We got characters with split personalities. Characters with very selective amnesia. Memory altering magic powers. Inconsistent magic powers that inexplicably work on some people while being useless against others. When your story has elements such as these, you know you are dealing with quite a mess. There are some satisfying revelations here and there but they don't outweigh the tremendous amounts of awful.

Also, every new bit of information we have learned about the titans as the show has progressed, has made them less and less cool. What happened to the ""grim reminder"" the mankind received at the beginning of the show? Living in fear of the titans? By the end of season 3 the characters are talking like the titans aren't even a factor anymore. And they are right! The titans are meaningless. In fact, they kill off all the titans! They JUST do it! Killing off ALL the regular titans, the once insurmountable enemy of mankind, isn't even deserving of a montage. Not even a dialogue scene. It's a passing sentence. One of the most horrific monsters ever created - reduced to this.

To wrap it up... The first 6 episodes of the season are a lot of fun. They are what drag my score for the season a little higher than it probably should be, considering the dreadful plot revelations in the final episodes."
Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"THIS, this is where Attack on Titan reached masterpiece for me. The show finally crossed the line of amazing thrill and shocking moments to ""investing"". In an arc filled with big battle scenes, the best episodes were deeply psychological. I enjoy the battle strategies of this arc, so much big brain energy on all sides. I love the theme of owning up to one decision with no regrets that the show explored, each choice revealed each character's essence. How in a war, you will end up losing something, but choosing what to lose is also a big part of survival. It really elevate the conflict
                  ...
in each scene.
The arc also finally provide us the satisfaction of learning the ""truth"" and the consequences of obtaining it. Sometimes that might not you free, and you can feel the weight of that on the characters. You know the world change from this point forward, and it just bring so much excitement and dread.

Top 3 characters this season: Eren (The hell this boy has been through. Eren's forever change by the truth, with his whole believe system being stripped down.), Hanji (She's been one of my favorite characters on the show as an advocate for progress, but she also hold the scout together emotionally here.), Floch (Probably controversial yet I think he adds so much depth to AOT. We've only seen the story from our main cast POV and have our bias, but as an outsider, he was the one affected by their choices without being able to choose.)"

It can be said that part 2 of season 3 is a special case, I can divide these 10 eps into two parts.
Part 1: Battle of Shiganshina
Indeed this is what I expect from AOT. Both season 2 and part 1 of season 3, at the climax, I still feel those battles have not reached the level of excitement as season 1, but here things are different. The battle with the Beast Titan at Shiganshina was so dramatic, thrilling every second and made me unable to take my eyes off the
                  ...
screen. The fighting scenes between survey corps and titans are not only good in terms of action but also in terms of war tactics.
The characters all have their own moments. There are some very interesting characters, so their ending makes me feel sad. I was expecting a more epic ending for those characters.
The music is really the bright spot, I'm always immersed in the atmosphere of the story very quickly.
After the battle ended, I was waiting for the next eps to explode, so I had expectations.
Part 2: Explanations for the Mysteries
If someone was waiting for the tunes of the final episodes to be as dramatic as the battle at Shiganshina, they'd be a bit disappointed.
This stage describes the aftermath of the war and the secrets are revealed.
It can be said that the tempo of these eps is slower and softer. The story of the mystery of the titans is explained quite reasonably, especially with the ""important key"" details connected to the previous seasons, I really like these two points.
However, everything is too exciting in the first eps, so when the story of the other world is described, everything becomes new and the viewer will have to try to remember new words, new concepts, and accidentally lost the drama inherent in the first eps. After all, the past is only for explaining the question.
The flashbacks are the whole episode length reveal the mysteries, and I have said in the previous reviews, the mystery is revealed, the attractiveness is only at a ratio of 50/50.
I have a lot of respect for the stories about titan that the author tried to bring to explain the world of AOT. But no matter how hard I try, the appeal of this answer cannot be maintained at the level of the eps talk about the current battle - Shiganshina.
In particular, although the supporting characters and main characters are impressive to some extent, the only thing missing from this season is the interaction between the characters, I mean the love between them. This has not yet been shown convincingly. The characters behave too mechanically, talking only about plans, heroism, and battles, instead of gestures of intimacy or concern for one another. The part where Eren-Historia interacts in the field is a short romance, it's too little compared to the number of young boys and girls in the story.
And in the end, the main character is put into a sluggish, miserable mood, no longer connected with people. Right now, love is the only thing that brings the character to good, but this is inherently rare from the beginning.
Art is not the highlight, compared to season 1.
The ending brings many facts, many strange concepts about war, between one race and another, instead of bringing the viewer into a state of emotional satisfaction.
If anyone is looking forward to a complicated story, many questions want to be answered, here are 10 eps worth enjoying.
If anyone just wants to see exciting battles, heroic characters, they will prefer the first 5 eps."

As a manga reader of this amazing series that Iseyama has pen down. The anime is equally if not an outstanding adaptation!

Okay now coming to this mind boggling story (Manga readers will know why i said this) I dont have anything but immense praise for it! It is just perfect! We started out as these teeny tiny humans inside these huge walls being attacked by this humongous titans to getting to know of this huge technologically advanced world which is prospering outside of these walls and this huge war between Marlyeans and Eldians that has led to this scenario! They really did decide to jump in head first. My eyes were literally glued to the screen, I couldnt take my eyes off. Personally, I love shows that build a great foundation in earlier seasons and then pick up the pace later on which is exactly what they've done so far. Shingeki no Kyojin has another layer of honesty and humanity added onto it by its strategic thinking and utilization of weaponry in Titans. Actual war plans and schemes are apparent, yet rarely feel cheap, as there is always meticulous planning and a keen eye for detail weaved into every element of the season. The pacing is stellar, with the 8 out of the 10 episodes adapting 2 chapters of the manga, and the other two episodes not feeling too dragged out. Heartfelt moments are executed brilliantly. Character arcs come to a satisfying close as new ones begin, and with the more emotional moments, tears will flow. Overall the story has come a long way from season 1 to Season 3 Part 2.

The art and animation of this season was as stellar as it gets! That fight between Levi and Beast Titan which took approximately one month to make happened so quick and so smooth that i had to rewind it like 10 times to process what has happened. That smooth ODM Gear dynamic camera movement always make me awe. I dont know how they get that animation so perfectly! But despite having a fantastic animation, 3D colossal titan was poorly animated, its movements were not realistic and the contrast between 2D and 3D did not fit well. But the pros were so much that you will forget any minute cons in the animation.

The OST is Magnificent! and Sawano is a genius. Every single one of his OSTs is a banger. From melancholy pieces for the sad moments to thrilling pieces for the epic moments, the Attack on Titan soundtrack remains one of the greatest; and the new tracks created for this season are no different. The sheer emotion one can feel from a track he created is simply amazing.

The character development, My God no one can complain about this now! it has gone peeks and boundaries compared to season 1! We got to know about many characters a little bit more this season Like Grishas backstory and the amont of screentime that armin got as well as erwin got which made us understand those characters a little bit more was done well.  The Main MC Eren, who was criticized for being a screaming cry baby is now one of the most well-written characters in the series (and now in the manga he literally became one of my top characters of all time) Just like the story built up to this season, character arcs that have been built up also come to a conclusion, whether it be ending with their death or beginning to head in a new direction.

So Finally Attack on titan is not something overly hyped, it has become incredible now, see Gigguks YT Video for your reference! Combining the epic moments, the jaw-dropping reveals, and emotional scenes, this season is a banger. It is the bangiest of bangers. How does one combine every possible outstanding thing an anime can do, into one anime? I don’t know, ask Isayama and WIT Studio. But this season achieves something truly great, making for one of the most enjoyable, outstanding and epic experiences you’ll ever have.

So, here we are!!! After a seriously long period of wait we finally get the the season 3's part 2.
Well to be very honest, i thought 10 episodes was too short a season to cover the Return to Shiganshina Arc, but they managed to pull it off nicely in those 10 episodes. WIT decided to change animations style this once a bit. I don't know of others but, the after seeing the animations in this season, the season was worth every moment of wait.

Coming to story, we get many shocking revelations and answers in this season. Well, some answers raise

new questions, If you are up to date with the manga you will know what I am talking of. Anime only people, I commend you for resisting and not reading the manga. Well, this arc was a major turning point in the manga, it is in the anime as well. The scenes are as beautiful as you would expect (possibly much more than that). The Eren Vs. Reiner fights are lit as hell. Eren has gottten so good at his hardening ability. 

My only problem being, why did Levi choose Armin over Erwin for the power of the Colossal Titan. Erwin is much much more better than Armin as he has will to sacrifice and has much more experience than him. I seriously would have loved to see Erwin as the Colosssal Titan.

All that said, the season is a total blockbuster! IF you haven't watched it, go WATCH IT!!

If you were disappointed that S3P1 didn't have much of the action that you imagined, don't worry because this was an explosive series. 

Story is one of the best aspects of Attack on Titan because everything just makes sense. The characters are smart, not stupidly entering a battle without forethought. Hajime Isayama has crafted an incredible story that leaves you wanting more. You never want the episode you are watching to end. Season 3 Part 2 contains some of the most crucial stages in the anime's story.

Animation is amazing, fight scenes

Hiroyuki Sawano once again deserves praise for his marvelous soundtrack. Crazy moments are elevated by the music and calm moments are diluted. Seriously, you're gonna wanna check out the soundtrack after watching this season.

Character's are tested. Many are broken. It's been years being a part of these characters lives. You've followed them through their journey and endeavors across Wall Maria. This season contains an insane amount of pivotal character moments. So be ready, because I wasn't. ;_;

Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"The second part of Attack on Titan's third season is everything I wanted it to be and more. It has sensational action. It has the big reveal of the world found in the basement. And, just as in the first part, it capitalizes on themes and character motivations setup in prior seasons; however, the second part does this much more often and to much greater effect.

Of course, this is just an opinion. Take it as such.

I want to start with a reflective view of some of the characters prior to the battle for Wall Maria. Commander Erwin is more to me than just the ruthlessly
                  ...
decisive commander he was in the first and second season. He became a commander to fulfil a childhood dream he shared with his father, to seek out the truth of the world that the government kept secret. Captain Levi is relatively unchanged from the first season but has come to know this dream of Erwin's after failing to convince him stay back from the battle and following the words spoken to him by his Uncle, Kenny, that relate very closely to the Commander's dream. At the end of the first part, we are reminded of Armin’s motivation for joining the Scouts, to explore the outside world, and his desire to share this dream with his childhood friend, Eren. And Eren, the overly idealistic kid that clung to revenge following his mother’s death, that subconsciously gave more value to his determination for success rather than his power to achieve it, now realizes he is weak. Instead of charging ahead like a fool, he first hesitates with fear before overcoming it with the desire for freedom that he had as a kid. There is much more to be said about the other characters, but I wanted to focus on these four because I believe they lay the groundwork for the best moments in the battle and what follows. 

The battle for Wall Maria has the same intensity and strategic depth as any of the previous seasons. However, this part of the show makes the action that much more impactful for a few reasons. 
1.) Our investment in the characters has increased as the show progressed, which is only natural and basically increases engagement all around. 
2.) The most important characters, whom I identified in the prior paragraph, find themselves in difficult situations that put them at odds with their chief desires. 
3.) These difficult situations are often resolved (or to be resolved) in a way that emphasizes the big themes carrying over from prior seasons. 
4.) The delivery. 
These aspects have elevated many successive moments in the action far beyond what is normally expected of an action series (detailed in the spoiler section with specific reference to these four points); it is an outstanding achievement I think without equal. If you know of a series that rivals this … PLEASE tell me.

The action is, of course, not the only thing going for these episodes. As is to be expected, the big reveal in the basement finally arrives. The information that was hidden is revealed to us through a flashback of the father’s life before having reached the walls. A bit of what I saw in the flashback was entirely expected as the show had heavily hinted at the nature of the reveal, but the author packed much more into it that we could not have imagined. The truth to the world is interesting in more ways than just in learning the lore. The reason behind this fight for the “survival of humanity” completely turns the tables. Everything has changed with the information found in the basement to the point where I cannot at all tell what will happen in the next season. It is a completely different show. Also, quick hint, check to see if you can recognize some faces among the extras.

Just like in the first part of the third season, in terms of animation, the show is really good, but not outstanding a majority of the time. Again, there is a killer animation sequence with Levi with amazing music to compliment it (what happens in the scene is also really freaking cool, so that helps). And again, some liberties are taken in the usual ways (CG, still frames with lip flaps, etc.) with at least one obvious slip up, but it is not detrimental to the show and you should not let it be. There are definitely very few compromises made in the most important moments, and the animation is very consistent with what the show has been like in the prior seasons.

If you are looking for things to criticize in the writing, good luck. There are certainly still some moments that I think could have been improved. The outcome of the colossal titan battle in particular could have maybe been orchestrated better (less or better sounding explanation). Also, maybe one moment in the father’s flashback could have given better reasoning. Other than those things, which are still nitpicks, almost nothing in the story seems to be nonsensical when you think it through. If you’re finding lots of mistakes in the writing, I question whether you were too quick to try pointing mistakes out either because of the hype around how good the show is or because you already decided that you dislike Attack on Titan generally. I don’t think anyone can deny the amazing achievements in the writing even if they do not like the show. Please consider watching up to the end of the third season if you haven’t already. It is worth it.

**The remainder of the review will have SPOILERS for my favorite moments. Given the nature of this season it is hard to avoid them. **

The first of these is Commander Erwin’s speech, a contender for my favorite, in which he convinces the recruits to help him serve as a distraction for Levi to assassinate the Beast Titan. Commander Erwin hesitates to implement this plan because he obviously cannot fulfil his dream if he dies in the charge (#2), which is most likely to happen. He however realizes the necessity for victory in this battle for those who sacrificed themselves, or gave their hearts, to get this far. The words Eren spoke to his father in the very first episode, that lives that have been lost would have been for nothing if others did not take up the cause, compare them to the speech Erwin gives to the recruits. The necessity of sacrifice is one of the strongest themes throughout the show and was well established right from the beginning (#3). That theme in combination with the voice acting, the facial expressions, the music, the Commander’s resignation to his fate, and all of it overlaying with the charge itself … I’m tearing up because of how amazing it is (#4). It is impeccable how everything came together in this moment. 

This is just the first of these moments lol. The show is too f***ing good man. The next moment is that amazing animation sequence with Levi where he decimates the Beast Titan but still lets him get away because of his desire to save Erwin (#2 and #4). Immediately after this is Armin’s and Eren’s faceoff with the Colossal Titan. Armin sacrifices himself as a diversion for Eren to surprise Bertholdt knowing that he wouldn’t be able to see the sea if he did this (#2), but he did it anyway with the hope that Eren would fulfil his dream for him. Two great moments back-to-back in one episode.

The next moment is another contender for my favorite in the series. The moment when Levi chooses to save Armin over Erwin. After the battle, the writer came up with this moment as if to say, “Hold up, I still have something better.” I love this moment so much. I love how all these things that touched Levi’s character led to the unexpected choice … the one that completely contradicted Levi’s decision after he defeated the Beast Titan (#2). And once again, the resolution emphasizes a theme … this one from another of my favorite moments. Kenny’s final words “Everyone had to be drunk on something to keep pushing on.” Just as Kenny had finally given up his desire for power, Erwin had given up his dream to find the truth that killed his father (#3). The scene prior to this moment as well, I feel so much tension in the air. The look on Mikasa’s face when she drew her blade drove it home for me.

Side Note: I could re-watch those three episodes alone over and over and over. I cannot believe how much went into them. Again, if anyone knows of something as good as this … I implore you to refer it to me. It could be anything: book, manga, or another show. I’ve been looking for quite some time now and I still haven’t found anything at this level.

Not to skirt the details of the flashback, trust me it’s amazing, but I want to finally conclude the review (b/c it’s way too long) with the last scene in this part of the series, which is another contender for my favorite moment (there are too many, I know lol). Eren as he faces the sea realizes that his visions of the past were all true. His hopes for freedom are squashed in that moment by the daunting reality that the whole world is his enemy (#2). Again, so much goes into such a simple moment. Remember Kenny’s backstory, his last conversation with Uri? What was the miracle that Uri spoke of in their relationship? Is such a miracle possible on the scale of warring nations? (#3). This series is absolutely incredible. There have been some rough patches at the start and throughout the show, but the result is undeniable. I can’t wait to see what’s next."

I’m going to start at the end. This conclusion is satisfying, even considering how much we have lost by this point. For those of you, the lucky ones, who will be watching this for the first time after season 4 has concluded, I can guarantee you will be watching season 4 immediately. It leaves you screaming for the next season. 

The continuation of the story is exceptionally well told. It is as wonderfully paced as Attack on Titan has ever been. It takes you on a journey through devastating loss
                  ...
to euphoric joy, from darkest space to the brightest place. There are no more words i could possibly write to truly express how amazing this story is other than phenomenal.

Although part 1 will hold, and I am pretty damn certain of this, the most perfectly written and animated action sequence of all time, this season had one of the most emotionally engaging. For those of you that have watch Gon vs Pitou, it’s almost the same level as that and it comes towards the climax of the season. I really can’t say anymore without going spoiler crazy.

In my personal opinion, if I was to look at this season alone, Attack on Titan would be the greatest anime ever written, it’s that good. Flawless story telling, exceptional animation and emotionally engaging. It really is a perfect season. The realisation of everything that you’ve seen comes together as one perfect picture at the very last scene of this season and shows how good conclusions can be.

A truly exceptional piece of work and again, in my opinion, one of the best seasons, of not the best season of anime I have ever seen. Absolutely perfect in every way."
Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I left a glowing review for Season 3 part 1. Just when I thought AoT couldn't get any better, it proved me wrong. This season not only delivered the same quality as the previous part, but it also went above and beyond by setting a standard for succeeding animes. It will be very hard for any show to balance both story and action while reaching the emotional level that SnK S2 P2 was able to reach. 

Story: Return to Shiganshina arc gives us what we have always been waiting for - the revelation of what is inside Eren's basement, and boy it doesn't disappoint. 
                  ...
The battle against the Titans to get there is full of suspenseful mind game, clever strategies, and of course, amazing actions. I watched every single episode with bated breath, anticipating what was going to happen next. Yet, amidst all the excitement of action sequences, the show still manages to move us to tears with the sacrifices that our protagonists have to make to ensure victory for mankind. The secret to the basement has been unlocked, and it opens up a whole new intricate story of the oppressed versus the oppressor, power corruption, greed, and so much more. The story so far has been pretty simple - ""we are the prey and they are the hunters."" We know there is something more lurking in the background. We know there are people vying for power and hiding the truth. What I didn't expect is how complex yet realistic the truth is. It shows how the oppressed can quickly become the oppressor once they grab hold of power. It is a painful portrayal of how power can corrupt a person's soul. 

Character: Season 3 is when you become completely invested in the characters. In this season, Erwin, Armin, Levi and later on, Eren, definitely take the spotlight. While Erwin and Armin, the two greatest minds of mankind, have to face the difficult choice between living to see their dreams fulfilled and dying for the sake of mankind, Captain Levi face the decision of who to revive, his friend and the experienced Erwin, or Armin, the young brilliant mind with great zest left for life. Isayama managed to make a hero out of all these characters while making them extremely human. They are complicated beings with paradoxical thoughts, and Levi, in making his final irrational yet reasonable decision, showcases this. Meanwhile, our protagonist Eren has changed so much at the end of the season upon learning the truth about the enemies that you cannot recognize he is the same person as the boy who screamed and shouted and tried to kill all the Titans he saw in Season 1. 

Besides the protagonists, Reiner and Bertholdt have the opportunity to display their humane side as well. The audience cannot help but sympathize with these young warriors who are victims of their government. Their farewell scene where these two buddies wish each other good luck broke me. Little details such as Bertholdt being relieved and happy in his disoriented state upon seeing Eren's squad as he still confused them for his allies shows how he truly considered them friends. Alas, this show is one of the very few shows that make me unable to decide who to cheer for.

Sound: Sawano went God-mode with the soundtrack. Enough said. 


If you have yet to watch this masterpiece of a season, I implore you, please do. You will NOT regret it."

Attack on Titan season 3 part 2, is amazing.

After the, needless to say, a bit of an underwhelming season 3 part 1 of attack on titan, season 3 part 2 makes up for everything. It starts of with a slow, calm pace, with the scouts searching for the traitors among then, in the walled off district in Shiganshina. After many failed attempts and Eren plugging up the walls holes, Armin BigBrain finds out that they have walked into the enemies hands, and that they were hiding inside the walls, So, after the overly dramatic and hype reveal, they start to fight. Reiner
                  ...
vs Eren and the scouts, and Zeke vs levi and erwin and.....the side characters. So they end up divising a pla- oh wait bertholds here. So berthold fucking nukes the place and kills everyone around him other than the main characters because....duh. So things are looking bad. Reiners nearly dead and Berthold is humungous. Whats the plan? Armin comes up with a plan so he and eren can kill berthold with them both seeing the sea. On the other side of the wall, Erwin Baddas leads the troops on a suicide march to kill the monkey and they all die, except from levi, who kills the beast titan and the person inside. Or not. The beast titan user gets taken away by the cart titan :0 and levi is the only one alive on the other side of the wall.....or is he. Yeah so armins dead, forgot to mention that he died while helping eren kill berthold. And then comes the best episode of Ainme, in my personal opinion.

Attack on Titan, season 3 episode 18. The most heartbraking episode.

It starts of, with eren, looking down at armin, his body burnt to a crispy. He hears Zeke approaching him, and threatens to kill berthold if he tries anything. Zeke replies ''You look nothing like your father.'' Before we can know what he's talking about, levi, with an evil look on his face, slides down the wall, onto the rooftops and chases after zeke. After levi makes it to eren, he asks for his fuel tanks, but before eren can give it to him, Armin is revealed to be alive. A few houses away, jean connie hange and mikasa are planning to kill Reiner, but unsuprisingly, Zeke comes riding in on the titan and takes reiner back, leaving armin to be the one to inherit the collosus titan. That is, until The last remaining survivor brings back a wounded erwin. They have to decide who to bring back. Erwin, or Armin.

This episode is heartbraking. This was achieved by the environment. No soundtrack, No dramatic upbeat sounds. Just the cracking of smoke and pain in the voices of the scouts.

I'll make a part 2 but for now, im out,"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"I don't usually watch the romantic comedy genre of things. I always enjoyed action, fantasy, adventure like Soul Eater, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun etc. but for some reason I was in the mood for something different. 

Toradora is just the 3rd romcom anime series i watched and I can truly say that it has become my FAVORITE anime.

The short version of this review is: I very much enjoyed Toradora

-The characters are all unique, likable, and relatable due to the fact they all display their weak sides sometimes and moments of insecurity behind the personality exterior. The chemistry between the characters was fun to watch

-The story stays
                  ...
away from cliches and was relatively unpredictable for a love story. Every character had a reason and motive for what they did and how they acted, other than just being unnaturally dumb/too prideful/stubborn.

-The soundtrack was really good, making certain scenes all the more memorable

-I loved the comedic scenarios in the beginning of the series, which gets progressively more serious and emotional as we get deeper into the story and characters, but the overall vibe of the show stays relatively consistent to the end

-I became emotionally invested in the overall plot and characters and couldn't stop watching, which is extremely rare for me, especially for this genre

Overall:10/10

----

I watched the 1st episode and was interested. After the 2nd ep, I was hooked. I watched all 25 episodes in one go, back to back, because I couldn't stop. Never has another series been able to keep me going (I usually don't watch more than 5 episodes in one sitting), but Toradora kept me wanting to click on the next episode each time until I was finished, and left wanting more (even though I was satisfied with the ending)

Afterwards, I thought a lot about why an anime series of a genre that is usually not my taste could have been able to retain my attention for so long, and i realized the answers: the characters and the overall story.

The characters are what make this series so great. Each character have personalities that are unique and rather realistic and believable (or as realistic as animes go). There is no ""super"" character that acts too good or too cool for school. There is no ""that annoying"" character that acts too snobby or stuck up, which can sometimes be a problem for tsundere characters. And this is all because every character shows a weak side or moments of insecurity, which makes each of them more relatable. It also allows for many rather comedic scenes as well as emotional moments. But the best part is the interactions and chemistry between all the characters, and the way each of them change as their relationship with each other grows.

The second thing is the story. The reason I usually don't care for romance or drama is because I usually find the story too cliche or predictable. I also hate those cliche moments of ""coincidence"", for example, when a main character happens to see his/her love interest with someone else accidentally and misunderstands. I also hate it when characters act unnaturally stupid or too prideful for no reason and let it get in the way of the relationship. 

But none of those cliche moments happen in Toradora. Every character has a reason and motive for the actions they decide to take. The story managed to keep me guessing and wanting to know what will happen next, instead of making me feel like i could write the story myself.

Another plus for Toradora is the music. There are some key scenes where the soundtrack actually triggered goosebumps and made me tear; it still does even after rewatching. THAT IS RARE FOR ME. In fact i don't think anything I've ever watched, not just anime, can even make me feel that emotionally invested in fictional characters.

Almost forgot to mention that after it was done, I started to watch it again from the beginning the next day. Another rare occurrence for me, as usually i don't feel like rewatching things for months.  I was able to pick up certain things that i missed with the first watch thru. The only reason I put the story as 9/10 was because of this. A few plot points weren't really shown or conveyed in the best way and were missed even to an avid viewer like me. But I was glad to have felt that way, leaving me thinking about what I missed, instead of feeling like I could have easily figured it out or seen it coming. 

Again, Toradora has become my favorite anime, as a guy that usually doesn't care for this genre, which says a lot. It gave me more enjoyment than any of the other anime I have seen so far. I would recommend it to anyone, not just romance lovers."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"This's the first time I got the ""4 seasons"" feeling while watching an entire anime show.

What's ""4 seasons"" feeling I am talking about? Here's the explanation:

I felt the sensation changed 4 times while watch this anime:

1st time: During episodes 1 to 2, watching those episodes for the first time I thought this series would just be a light comedy anime which will make me chuckle without a  complicated story. It just like the spring season that give a high hopes on the early year.

2nd time: During episodes 3 to 14, I'm getting a bit bored and almost drop it, but I decided to push
                  ...
my self to finish it (the only reasons I want to finish it is just because I got interest by the last main character who showed up in this part). It just like summer season that is really hot, and the only fun is going to beach during the summer break.

3rd time: During episodes 15 to 24, my curiosity was piqued for what will be going on with this show, things got a bit complicated, and I think this part is the ""life"" of the series. Just like an autumn season, although the flowers fall, but becomes a wonderful scenery.

4th time: During the final episode, ""WHAT THE HELL"", with this final episode, I mean everything seems fine at the beginning of the episode, but in the end it turned out anti-climatic for me. Just like the winter season, unpredictable storms, snow, and always cold; but after that Spring comes.

Well, that's my personal view of the story, so I give 7/10 for it.

Art and Sound, nothing particular to comment, it all seem good enough, and I like the second opening OST. 7/10 for both of it.

All characters were unique, both in design and personalities, even with the supporting characters, they are all really good. A great job was done by the creator at this point. EXCEPT for MC's pet, it's very annoying, and I really like ""Ami-n"", her appearance, her personality, her reactions, her way of pretending to be an adult (she's the last MC that I mentioned before), so 8/10 For Chara design.

For the enjoyment, I think I'll go for 7/10 that because this show had me feel bored once, and the ending was anti-climatic for me, but I do like the humor and story development (starting from episode 15).

Overall 7/10 score for this show."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Romance has always been a tricky, unforgiving genre; you make one mistake and the story slowly begins to crumble. Why is that? Well, as many of us may know, love is a complicated business. So is entertainment. So why do we watch romantic series? There's many different answers that vary based on the individual. Maybe we're simply taking a chance at trying to find a feeling. A feeling of the tingle of our heartstrings, or a stir in our human emotions. It's good to feel these things from time to time. Fortunately for us, Toradora is a series that gracefully grants us this chance. It
                  ...
captivates us in remembering what a romance series should strive to be.

What makes Toradora so exceptional as far as the romance genre goes? Is it the story? The art? The Sound? The Characters? It just may be all of them combined. I'd like to begin by stating something. The story of Toradora is very predictable. Cliché even. But wait, isn't that a bad thing? While the story may seem plain, the execution of the pacing is undeniably good at assuming a calm, relaxed flow for the majority of its run which, in turn, yields a satisfying romantic series as a result.

Toradora is not like many other romantic series out there that have characters fall in love simply just because. Love slowly stems from what begins as two people who become friends looking for mutual assistance in their romantic interests. Toradora gives its audience room to breathe and focuses the first half of the show on building the friendship between the two main characters through silly, lighthearted antics, making developed romantic feelings between characters seem more realistic and sincere later down the line when things become more serious. However, love is a complicated business, as I've said in my introduction. People's feelings do get walked over and left in the dust. While it's thematically a good thing for the audience to feel touched emotionally, seeing characters getting their emotions crushed was truly a somber sight to behold.

The art was smooth and was enjoyable visually. I did like the consistency that Toradora’s animation offered. For a series that was done in the 2008-2009 time period, it still looks marvelous and holds its own compared to more recent anime. The sound was a big plus in my book. While I liked both the OPs and EDs, I have to give a big shout out to the timing of the music during dramatic moments; that repetitive melody of piano left quite a strong impression on me. I'd like to also address that the script and voice actors were really quite something. The dark little subtleties in comments or remarks were an admirable feature the show had to offer.

I think every romantic series heavily depends on its cast to be the foundation of the series, holding the structure of the show into place. The characters of Toradora are an interesting bunch that create the opportunity for its audience to laugh and also feel gloomy. There is more than meets the eye underneath these seemingly cliché characters. Ryuuji is the male lead and he is generally a very likable, realistic character. He struggles with romance, gets low self-esteem because he’s self-conscious, and regularly voices his opinions on matters at hand. Throughout the show he proves that he’s a loyal friend and all around good guy, though he might be a little obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and order. But hey, who doesn't have their own little quirks?

Moving onto the main female lead, I felt a little wishy-washy in regards to liking Taiga’s character. I’m not a fan of the tsundere type, and that’s exactly what she is. While Taiga acts like a brat most of the time, she also becomes more and more endearing as the series progresses. She stands up for herself and her friends, and despite her childish behavior, generally cares for the people around her. With the main two characters out of the way, what about the other ‘main’ characters: Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami?

One of Toradora’s strengths was allowing the supporting characters to have their moments in the spotlight. Because of this, we are able to obtain a deeper understanding of them and paint a better picture of them as characters. While Ami and Minori seem perceptive of the relationships in the group, I’m honestly not sure about Yuusaku. Under his oblivious façade it’s somewhat difficult to tell. While he's Ryuuji's best friend, he is oddly quite different compared to him. Yuusaku is energetic, outgoing, responsible, yet also very silly and childish. Minori seems like genuinely a nice girl with the happy on the outside cliché personality, but Minori is really a coward underneath it all; she doesn’t confront her own emotions and constantly pushes for Taiga’s happiness at her own expense. It’s not that I disliked Minori as a character, it was just agitating to watch her at times. Last but not least, Kawashima, Ami. Ami is the most astute of the unsaid troubles that are bothering the people in the group and often makes subtle comments or sarcastic remarks pertaining to their unspoken feelings. When she is first introduced she seems extremely stuck up and vain, but as the series progressed it becomes more apparent that she’s tactfully looking out for the people she can finally call ‘friends’ for the first time. She developed the most out of the three supporting main characters, in my opinion, and easily became one of my favorite characters of the series, if not my most favorite.

Despite how gratifying I thought the series was, I also can’t turn a blind eye on the aspects of the show that I did not like. One of the most annoying tropes in anime, at least for me, is characters getting hit for no reason, or very petty ones. It's a trope that comes hand-in-hand with the tsundere character archetype, and it's one of the reasons I dislike tsundere characters as a whole. Taiga, who basically goes down the list of tsundere character traits like a check list, is a huge offender of verbally and physically abusing Ryuuji early on in the series. If you're like me, you'll find this to be quite vexing. Lastly, fan service is apparent in nearly every recent anime. While I personally dislike fan service, I know that many series utilize it to keep a portion of their audience interested. I watched Toradora because it was a romance story that set itself apart from most others. Although it's substantially toned down, comparatively to other series, I believe Toradora would have been better off not utilizing any fan service at all.

While I did like the ending overall because it ties things up nicely, and felt fairly rewarding, I did not like how the ending felt very rushed. The amount of material crammed into the last couple episodes felt considerably off, considering the rest of the show was focused on coaxing the relationships at a much slower pace. A couple bad apples on a tree don’t make the rest of the apples rotten, and Toradora was far from being bad. It isn’t a completely perfect series, but one of the best the romance genre has to offer in anime so far.

Every once in a while a person can't help but wonder what if. There has been a time in all our lives when we have pondered the thought of meeting the 'one' who is exactly right for us. Every day we strive to find a person, or people, who understand and accept us for who we are. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll find that one person that fits together with you like two consecutive cogs in an intricate machine. Maybe, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who is exactly right for you. It's not because this person is perfect, or because you are, but because your combined flaws fit together seamlessly in a way that allows two different beings to coexist together perfectly as equals … something like a Tiger and a Dragon."

-------------------
Toradora!= Another normal romance/drama anime involving high school...We had many anime of this kind. In fact, these type of anime are very common nowadays. I had watched this type many times, but mostly ended up so wrongly. 

But this time, Toradora! is done the right way. Yup, I ended up loving this ""normal"" anime. Story involves two high-schoolers, a normal guy, and a short girl....Now where have I heard that from? Many anime had this kind of story. Yup, It kinda gives me feelings of Deja Vu-ness. This time its done the way I like it. On to the review....

Story-
                  ...
Involves a ordinary guy named Ryuuji Takasu and a short and short-tempered girl named Aisaka Taiga. This reminds of Saito and Louise from the Zero no Tsukaima series. Where the protagonist always gets beaten up by the girl, yeah those type. And more strangely, most of these short anime girls are always so strong or feared by many..thats Taiga a.k.a Palmtop Tiger. While Ryuuji only looks scary, but in reality, he's pretty harmless. OK~ enough of that...Why only a 7 for the story? Its pretty common..and its very predictable. I knew Ryuuji would end up with Taiga even just by looking at the cover art without watching the anime!. So obvious, so predictable, which makes it a bit boring. This flaw is common in many romance/drama anime, but its quite annoying. Story have a very good pace but it took quite a while for both of the hero and heroine to fall in love. Yup, they fell in love...but it took so long! But that's a good thing right? haahha- well~ those are the flaws I found here. Story= 7 out of 10.

Art- Graphics are rather unusual but very good..which I would say, Graphics are unique, that's for sure. Good graphics should receive a good score!
Art= 9 out of 10.

Sound-  The anime had 2 OP and 2 ED...1st OP was...strange. Same goes for the 1st ED. But the 2nd? Both the 2nd OP and ED are both awesome~. The 2nd OP tells  Ryuuji and Taiga's ""love"" arc is going to start. Don't get any wrong ideas. XD
Sound= 9 out of 10.

Character- All characters are uniquely made...Yup, especially Taiga and Minori. Minori had a very funny attitude which I loved. Awesome characters, awesome score.
Character= 10 out of 10.

Enjoyment- I enjoyed every single episode there was, some were very memorable but few are forgettable. I personally, enjoyed every minute of the anime which included comedy, parodies, romance, and some parts were very sad. Sad, but not as sad as Ef- Tale of memories. Toradora! can make you have ""watery eyes"", but Ef probably can make you cry. Beyond Awesome enjoyment.
Enjoyment= 10 out of 10.

Overall= Toradora! is not really recommended for everyone to watch, but Its highly recommended for fans of Romance/drama/comedy anime with a bit of sadness. If you bought it, its worth every penny. Anyone looking for some romance, then this could be your answer to that question. If you watch it online, its worth every minute and if you downloaded it, its worth every bits of data. 
OVERALL= 10 out of 10. Really loved it."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,"Not RecommendedPreliminary
                
                                      (21/25 eps)","Toradora! is one of the most annoying shows I have ever watched. And it has the single most ridiculous  ending of all anime I've seen. Even the ending of Claymore was more satisfying, which is saying something.

It is naturally that annoying because initially it seems to have much quality. I liked animation, music, opening, and, most importantly, I really liked most of the characters, including Taiga and Ryuuji. It is definitely quite cliché but charming brainless high-school romance with engaging characters isn't something I automatically hate. 

But, as episodes go by, all of the shows' cons start to become visible. First of all -
                  ...
it is too long relative to its content. Generally I'm ready to forgive Japanese for being so inept at confessing emotions, but my tolerance is limited and after over ten episodes fueled only by ""omg, I'm so Japanese, I just can't spit it out"" I'm totally fed up. Then around episode 11th Toradora experiences massive tone-shift and evolves into a soap opera without any significant comedy element. It wouldn't be a problem, but honestly it's not a very good soap opera - the dilemmas and problems seem forced for the sake of drama and easily solvable, had characters sit down and talked. As a result the entire middle part of the show feels completely unnecessary and contributes little to the main plot.

But still it is not tragically bad and these unnecessary middle parts may be fun for someone who likes Slice of Life genre. The real problems begin when the series after much overblown melodrama finally establishes official couple. There are many people who didn't like the pairing and preferred the other ones. For me the problem was not the pairing (because I personally preferred it over the others) but the way it was dealt with - I got the strong impression that the story on an emotional level actually justifies these other relationships better (even although I didn't like them). The final confession ends up being forced onto the couple, not only by the writers who want to rush the end, but by the other characters in-universe as well. As a result final romantic couple is not very romantic - at least one side of that pairing was literally dragged into it by external circumstances. And when one puts into consideration the fact that this forced side had all the chance to act on its own will few episodes before, yet it chose to pass, one begins to wonder what the writers had on their minds.

Still, I wouldn't dislike the show that much. But the very last arc also turns Toradora!, already an over-exalted soap-opera, into a full-blown Bollywood movie. The only difference between the two is that Toradora manages to have even more unnecessary stupid drama than its Indian counterparts.  Characters start to behave completely at random, clearly with a goal to create as much drama as possible, without any other reason. The viewers are presented with a runaway couple (which ran away for no reason whatsoever), hasty engagement (without even sharing a single kiss beforehand), missing fathers, a few family reconciliations and the girl leaving a boy without a single a word for an extended period of time (again without a good reason). All of these serious events are introduced over the span of one and a half episode and resolved almost immediately. That was so unbelievably contrived, idiotic and poorly handled it was painful to watch. And it was absolutely not romantic. At all.

There is something seriously wrong with romantic comedy that manages to be ultimately neither romantic nor funny. That combined with the unbearable forced melodrama and the clumsy treatment of last six episodes sinked this show so much, I can't rate it any higher."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.

Story: Secret love, unrequited love, love triangle... So yeah... The funny thing is that the ending is given away in the beginning. This can't even be considered spoilers to say that the main characters are going to end up together. Anybody who says otherwise is just too blind to realise this. Let's take the main points of the plot. First of all, one guy, one girl, each in love with each other's best friend. Two, those two try to support each other with their love interest. In order to do that, make them spend a lot of time together.
                  ...
Even make them live next to each other. Give them a social outcast aura and the result is: congratulations! you got yourself a very unoriginal couple. Now this is a shame because the idea is quite realistic, only too obvious which gives you no expectations. For all I know, Ryuuji and Taiga could hold hands, cuddle, hug, kiss, have sex, get married and act like there is some distance between. Awkward since there is absolutely none. From the beginning, they were already ridiculously close to each other by living next door but no, not close enough, need to live under the same roof. Even best friends don't do that ( yeah I know, room-mates or particular situation involving money but that wasn't one of them ) so it clearly gives you an idea of their relationship.

Art: This part pisses me off, it is so bad. Taiga is supposed to be cute... it didn't do it for me.She looks like an underdeveloped child with a big head and permanent bed hair.  Maybe it's just me but the chara design really need some work. However Ryuuji's face gets +1. Now if I just say this without evidence to back up my argument, it's just trolling. If possible, watch the fight scene between Taiga and Sumire. To avoid spoilers, well, watch it on mute and no subs... The animation is really sloppy here, whether it's the lighting, the background characters with the same face or simply character motions. The art is good only when everything is still. Sloppy sloppy sloppy.


Sound: Too bad I didn't pay much attention, but the openings and endings were nothing spectacular or catchy. When it comes to sound, I would say that music is more important than the voice acting since most of the time, the acting is flawless, it just comes to whether or not the seiyuu's voice is appropriate to the character. In Toradora, it's the usual. The usual being flawless performance. Now for the music, the comparison might be unfair but Toradora is nothing compared to say, Clannad. I chose Clannad because no matter the scene, sad, happy or epic, it's easy to remember the themes while Toradora produces music that you hear in elevators or supermarkets. Only one stands out: Lost my Pieces. But it's just one... Not enough.

Character: Ami saves the show a little with Minori not far behind but Taiga... Damn she pisses me off! Ryuuji is not bad but too weak to be important.
Ami and Minori had good scenes, good chara development. I didn't give a shit about Kitamura because he is a creepy smiling guy. Ryuuji had some changes but nothing significant. Taiga on the other hand, just got more and more annoying. She's not even a tsundere, the dere part is inexistant and replaced by retard state, otherwise she's just a plain spoiled bitch who needs to be left alone. That does it, she gets a -2 for being so unlikeable. Past the physical appearance which I don't even like one bit, she has nothing left except her execrable personnality. Now one way to sum up this show is that the side characters are more interesting than the main characters. When I say main, I mean Ryuuji and Taiga. Kitamura, Minori and Ami are side characters to me. While watching the show, I realised that I had no interest in whatever happens to Ryuuji and Taiga cause they already act like a couple. The side characters however make you want to know more about them. Creepy smiling dude Kitamura has a good reason for being like this while double face Ami and oddball Minori are kinda left out towards the end after much chara development. Bad idea. My main concern is how people perceive Taiga. She does things that makes you want to slap her really f*cking hard and shout what the f*ck is wrong with you? yet she is still described as being cute, lovely etc... That girl seriously has anger issues and they can't be justified by people calling you palmtop tiger, that's retarded. She's so rude it's not even funny. Now this might be spoilers but it sums up pretty much why I think her personality is the worst. In one scene, she learns about her unrequited love confessing to a certain girl who for specific reasons refuses to give a proper answer. This is because she's going away soon so she can't say yes yet doesn't want to lie to herself by saying no. What should Taiga do in this case? Well, nothing. For the simple reason that it doesn't concern her. Still, she goes out of her way to beat the crap out of that girl while insulting her and forcing her to say she hates the guy. I was thinking ""WTF"" the whole time. What gives her the right to beat someone up just because that person is a coward when it comes to love? If we had to beat up every person who is a coward because of love, we're doomed. Besides she's also overreacting and goes as far as insulting and hitting people for no reason. With Ryuuji, they represent the epitome of shallow people. Both of them have a crush on someone who's really popular. The reason surely is because they treat them differently from the rest of the class. If that's not being shallow. Take one guy who's a social outcast. Now take a girl who's really popular, kind, funny, pretty and easy to talk to. This one guy would probably fall in love with that girl if she goes to talk to him because he's probably thinking ""she's so nice, she talks to me while the other bastards don't even look at me, maybe she cares about me"" without realising that maybe she's just nice and talks to everybody. This describes Ryuuji and Taiga perfectly.

Enjoyment: I was really disappointed by Toradora. At first I thought it would have nice development with the introduction of Ami but I guess not. It was dull and slow. Once you feel like there's something going to happen just push the reset button because it has the same feeling. Got some funny scenes though. Unfortunately the show is barely realistic. You don't root for development of the relationship between the characters and their crush because there's no feeling, no background story. Things would've been simpler like this:
Ryuuji: I like Minori.
Taiga: Oh... I see. I like Kitamura.
Ryuuji: !!! What!? Ok. So...
Both: Wanna hang out sometimes?"

                                      (14/25 eps)","Note: this series has been dropped at episode 14

Unlike the main protagonist of this anime, I do not have much strength to withstand torture. Put me in the clutches of a diabolical serial killer/torturer, and I have no idea what I’d do. Ryuji, our hero, is one of a kind. Bards should sing about him in taverns all across Tamriel. For 14 episodes, he stands Taiga’s relentless abuse with a smile.

In one of the greatest songs ever written, the extremely white lead singer of the Smiths sings about how it’s so easy to laugh and so easy to hate. Kindness and gentleness are difficult, and
                  ...
I do agree with him. That said, I wonder if the band and their fanbase would change their mind if they saw the anime. Actually, considering how huge this anime is, becoming iconic in the school genre – I think they won’t.

I’m a defender of the school genre. Many rant about how immature and derivative it is, but few people didn’t go to school. A lot of things happen in school and you meet a lot of people, so it’s a place rife for stories. Its low-key and stable environment actually makes it excellent for stories driven by characters. Conflicts will have to rise from within and not an external UFO coming to wreck the party. These shows rely heavily on their characters, and it’s enough to have a decent, odd cast – see Haganai – to make something decent. Toradora is a major failure because of how insufferable its cast is.

Since we’re talking about symbols and not actual human beings, I need to find a way to explain why and how disgusted I was with them and how that lead me to conclude this anime is horrid crap. Many a great story are about horrible people. In fact, one of the best novels ever is about such a terrible murder. It’s their darkness, their psychology and reasons for being so that makes them so intriguing. How frightening these characters are because we understand them and see us in them. Part of our obsession with villains and their backstories, or with serial killers’ childhoods is because we want to know why they’re like this.

Everyone in Toradora is a bit of an asshole. Actually, only two characters are but they’re so dominant that it’s easy to forget about the rest. Taiga is the big problem, since she’s both the main character and the worst. Tsunderes can often seem creepy, sometimes borderline Gacy-like sadistic. None of them are as bad as Taiga.

The archetype can be funny. Tsunderes’ appeal is their insecurity, how they address the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life – we put up a front in every social interaction, putting a different front in different places. The best Tsundere, Neptunia‘s Noire is all about this. Humor never comes from her being violent – she’s rarely is – but how hard she works on her image.

In contrast, Taiga is nothing but violence. She reacts to everything with violence, like a 10-year-old playing Elder Scrolls and thinking that it’s supercool to kill every NPC. She may not kill anyone, let alone essential NPC’s but it doesn’t make it any less creepy. In every episode, she beats up people at least 5 times. Her reactions are always with force, causing clear pain to the other characters. I’d expect anyone to beat her in return the first time.

The fact Ryuji stays there is flat-out creepy. Moreover, she treats him with pure condescension. Rarely, if ever, she addresses him in a way that’s not hostile. Early in the series they make a pact to help each other, but Taiga doesn’t actually help him until the middle of the series. All the episodes are about the characters doing stuff and Taiga beating people up. The anime never answers why, exactly, Ryuji puts up with so much physical abuse.

Yes, ‘abuse’ is the only word that can describes their relationship. Switch the sexes. Imagine if Ryuji was constantly beating up Taiga, calling her ‘bitch’ and so forth. It’s nothing but sick. You can only watch it for so long before getting tired of this torture porn thing. Not only Taiga is violent to everyone, she also has a weird entitlement problem. She expects Ryuji to take care of her and do everything for her. She never asks, demands with the expectations that Ryuji must do it for her.

In the end, she’s nothing but a horrible person who beats up everyone but also thinks everyone owes her everything. Now, a character being a terrible human being isn’t enough. How their actions are framed is important and now we get to the main problem. Taiga is framed as okay.

A backstory occasionally rears its head, feelings of insecurity do show themselves. None of is it actually dark, none of it gives us a glimpse into a troubled psych that can only react with violence and cannot connect to people. The backstory may justify anger, but the anime never acknowledge how bad Taiga’s case is. No one around her also reacts like they should. They treat her like she’s a quirky friend, someone who occasionally goes off, like that friend who swears a lot. This is a person who’s in desperate need of help and a lawyer. It’s no longer a person having anger issues but a criminal that everyone tolerates because the plot demands it.

Such light framing of dark material is unforgivable. Humor doesn’t have anything to do with it, but how the frame never addresses the darkness of it. Physical abuse leaves people with trauma. People react harshly to physical abuse. If people stay for a long time with a physical person, being nice to them and doing what they want it means they got issues of their own. I can’t stress how dark this material is, yet the light framing is disrespectful to anyone who went through physical abuse.

Taiga and the framing of her behavior towers over the anime, so everything else ends up pointless. No matter how hard they try, the creators frame Taiga as quirky and cute. Nothing can salvage the anime, but then again it doesn’t seem they try. There isn’t much in the way of stories or characters. Ryuji is like that dude from Haganai only not as hot. Somehow he manages to be perfect and eventually the center of the harem because he’s nice to everyone and doesn’t have wants of his own. To the anime’s credit, the secondary male actually has a purpose here and he’s a bit hot, but besides being a more energetic nice guy there’s nothing to him.

Other females consist of a wacky redhead who’s entertaining for five episodes and then becomes tiresome. As for Ami, she’s another generic asshole who’s overall unpleasant without the darkness. Like Taiga, she treats people like crap but the cruelty is never meant to shock or make us reflect. Funniest thing is how the anime passes her off as sexy. Not only the characters can’t drive a story, but they look bad.

Art style is another problem the anime suffers from. No one has a distinctive look. School anime, at worst, create pleasing to look at characters. You may not experience anything profound but there is aesthetic value in the designs, in understanding human beauty. Designs don’t have to break boundaries, but little touches like Sena’s butterfly and deep eye color make an anime more pleasing to look at.

Toradora does nothing like this. Taiga does have a weird hairstyle, but Minori isn’t memorable at all. She has huge eyes and short red hair. End description. Worse offender is Ami who is meant to be the sex symbol. To express this, they gave her a longer hair and slightly bigger breasts. Unlike shows where the characters are actually sexy, her figure isn’t defined or emphasized – which is necessary if the character’s beauty is important to her personality. Her hair is just long without hairstyle quirks. Look at any anime that has a character whose beauty is important and you can always spot details expressing it – just as I described Sena in the above paragraph. The designers decided to do the bare minimum.

Character designs are integral to how we view them. How people look is a part of them. It doesn’t mean characters should all be sexy (that’s actually quite odd) but their looks should somehow find their way to their personality. If your character is meant to be beautiful, make them beautiful. Toradora is satisfied with just sending the signals, mistaking low effort for minimalism. Minimalism is when you have few details but these details are important. Ami’s design and everyone else’s has no effort put into it. A simplicity that has no elegance, that emphasizes no details is just a product of no effort and laziness.

Maybe the anime drastically improves. I have a hard time believing it. Watching this anime became painful. Witnessing the abuse Taiga inflicts on everyone, and expecting to be entertained and amused by it is too much. Torture porn at least acknowledges its characters suffer even if it expects me to find entertainment in pain. This anime pretends physical abuse doesn’t cause any pain. Truly, it’s objectionable almost on a moral standard.

Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"I'll keep this short and simple. Screw this anime.

Sound and art are fine. Not really too detailed art with a little bit of comedy sketches. The sound matches well with the series which would give it a higher score if the series was good.

Now the reason why this series sucks. TAIGA IS A GIANT BITCH. That should be tazered and thrown into Mount Doom. I get the appeal of Tsundere which is the demographic for this show. Taiga is the completely horrible side of Tsundere. Tsundere are supposed to be a tale of two sides with a harsh side balancing a hidden sweet side. IF
                  ...
the harsh side is a psychopath I don't give a damn if there is a sweet side. I don't even need to go past the first episode to prove that this girl is certifiable. She breaks into the protagonist's home, illegal, assaults him with a deadly weapon, illegal, damages his property, illegal, and then extorts him to get her to leave, illegal.

People in the anime world, abuse isn't fine if it's female on male. It's one thing if it's a single hit or insult every once in awhile but Taiga does this abuse constantly. It makes her completely unlikable for anyone who has dealt with abuse before and can't just laugh off a shit character. The easiest way to see if it hits the double standard is flip the genders. This becomes a freaking black comedy/horror if you switch the protagonist's genders.

I get the reason why people laugh at pain. Watching a drunk guy on youtube fall over himself and try to base jump off his roof is pretty damn funny. What I don't get is why anyone would willingly hang out with a person that makes your life hell by insulting and hurting you all the time. 

Any story that would try and portray a character like that as lead heroine role needs to be burned with fire. I would give this anime a zero but watching Taiga get her karmic justice raises the score. 2 out of 10 Recommendation: Put it on a rocket ship, fly it out to unknown coordinates, and hyper beam it into oblivion. The perfect example of how NOT to make a Tsundere lead in a romantic comedy (Her and Louise Valliere of Familiar of Zero)."

                                      (24/25 eps)","Going into Toradora, I wasn’t really expecting too much from it. I thought it would be your standard school life love story we have all seen so many times before. But low and behold it came out to be surprisingly good, and has quickly become one of my favorite 2008 airing anime series.

Story: 9/10
The story revolves around Ryuuji and Tiaga, two ordinary students that end up working together in order to help one another end up with the ones they love. It stays pretty true to the ""love story"" formula. What makes this anime really good is the excellent pacing it takes with the story.
                  ...
In many ""school life"" anime we always end up watching filler style episodes, only to have the end of the series be the only thing good about it. Not so for Toradora however! It manages to keep the anticipation between the potential couples high, all along weaving together a pretty good in depth story that really shows the heart of the characters. A lot of times we have scenes that show the characters trying to get the words out to express their feelings, and others offer more side story scenarios-- which usually end up going in conjunction with a certain character’s inner turmoil and struggle. Each episode flows nicely into the next, and you get some pretty clever comedy along the way. Now that is not to say that Toradora's story is without fault; not every episode is particularity interesting as others, towards the end the story tends to drag on a bit and feel somewhat rushed, and the characters start to get in a sort of ""pity party"" mood with their situations, which can get to be a bit of a downer at times. Still though, haven’t all of us been there at one point in our lives, where we really want to say what is in our hearts, but end up holding back for risk of getting hurt? Or even worse, hurting another? Overall the story is filled with enough drama and guess work to keep the audience into it! Though it should be said that hardcore romance fans may be able to predict some of the twists and turns the plot takes. It does come close to becoming a bit of a harem anime, but just never quite reaches that category. The anticipation of ""who will end up with who?"" --is the stories strongest feature, and the ending doesn't disappoint!!

Art: 7/10
The art really isn’t anything too special. You get a nice mixture of bright colorful characters and environments. The characters are sharp and well animated with their facial expressions, but the backgrounds can look a bit washed out at times. And some of the action scenarios can be a bit on the stiff side. Again, the character’s faces are what stood out for me the most with the art, you really feel like you can read them at times.

Sound: 8/10
Like the visuals, I wouldn’t go on par to say that the music can be anything more than ""appropriate."" You do get some pretty nifty opening and closing songs, and they change mid way through the series. The BG music was nothing--if not forgettable. Even while writing this I can’t really think of a piece that stood out for me. What does make the soundtrack so good however, are the character voices! All of them were matched perfectly to a ""T, "" and I could not find a single voice actor to be out of place with their role. I especially enjoyed Taiga’s voice. She has this tough girl tone and attitude, yet you can tell that deep down inside she really does care about those around her. Something that the viewer will indeed discover while making their way through the anime.

Characters: 9/10
Definitely the heart of Toradora! While going through this anime I really felt that I started a ""virtual"" style bond with them. I actually cared about the problems they had, and wanted them to end up happy in the end. Towards the beginning, viewers may find a character or two that they either dislike or even despise. But trust me when I say this: ""stick with it!"" They end up evolving and have many twits to their persona! Taiga is really the one who stole the show for me, she has so many layers to her personality that it can be hard to figure out just what is going through her head at times. A character named Minorin can be drop dead funny when she wants to be, and Ryuuji is a great guy that is always there for his friends. The best compliment I can say about the cast? They act very human (ie: realistic), maybe a bit exaggerated at times, but mix the two together very well! Which can be hard to do in an anime. My only real knock against the characters was, since there are multiple romance skits going on, at times it felt like some of them were a bit too discreet with confessing to one another; which in turn can make the story slow paced at times. I almost felt like I wanted to jump inside my computer screen and yell: ""Oh just say it already!!!"" That aside, there really isn't much to complain about, great cast! 

Enjoyment: 10/10
Despite some of the glitches in the storyline, I still never the less found myself totally drawn into the world of Toradora! It had more than enough to offer to keep me wanting more! The mixture of comedy, romance, suspense and tender moments--really drew me in!

Overall: 9/10
Toradora makes us contemplate what is more important in life; love or friendship? This anime really turned out to be a great surprise for me. Sure its got some flaws and all. But this series has it where it really counts; character chemistry and development! If you are a fan of romance anime, complimented with a great cast of characters and funny anecdotes. Then I highly recommend giving Toradora a try! It may not do anything new with its romance formula, but it does indeed do it right!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"The premise of the show is pretty hard to believe. After an accidental meeting involving two violent outbursts, Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji Takasu make an agreement to help one another pursue their respective love interests, Kitamura and Kushieda, who also happen to be Ryuuji and Taiga's mutual friends. It's the stockholm syndrome trope, create a situation in which the two main characters are forced to spend large amounts of time together and wait for them to fall in love. High school ‘contracts’ are an object of fiction, much like the accidentally overheard conversations that drive most of the character development. People do overhear things occasionally,
                  ...
but when the relationship is progressed entirely through cliches, it’s pretty hard to take it seriously.

However, after a rocky beginning I actually began to enjoy watching Taiga and Ryuuji. Ryuuji is more functional than most adults, doing all the cooking and cleaning for his mom who comes home late from her job as a cocktail waitress and sleeps most of the day. Ryuuji finds another dependent in Taiga, whom he feeds and launders for on a daily basis. He discovers her living amongst dirty dishes and garbage after entering her unlocked apartment to wake her up and make her breakfast. What’s important here is Ryuuji isn’t just a caretaker to Taiga, he represents something she’s never had, a person who genuinely cares about her and accepts her for who she is. He's a surrogate parent, which will be incredibly significant as we learn more of her backstory. He doesn’t complain that Taiga’s a mess, he just helps her pick it up and she slowly improves. This relationship does have some kind of benefit for Ryuuji as well, though it's far from ideal for him.

He seems to derive enjoyment from taking care of the dysfunctional Taiga, and given his relationship with his mother, who's equally bad at taking care of herself, it's very understandable that he's okay with it, he's used to it after all. But not only is their relationship is entirely one-sided, Ryuuji deals with being verbally and physically abused by Taiga constantly, aggression can definitely be attractive in a girl, but there's a difference between being aggressive and abusive. As part of their agreement, Taiga calls him a dog and commands him to do whatever she wishes... and he agrees. I guess he just really, REALLY wants Kushieda, and somehow plotting schemes with the diminutive and violent Taiga seems a better idea to him than simply talking to somebody he's already friends with. It's not like Kushieda's distant with him either, she bubbly, confident, and provides Ryuuji multiple opportunities to get closer to her, hell, they get locked in a storage room together for hours. At this point the overbearing use of cliches started to make me believe Toradora! was a satire, but given the amount of melodrama I'm pretty sure that it's takes its romance seriously. However, it’s important to remember that it’s Kushieda he’s interested in, so it’s not like the show is trying to force TaigaxRyuuji down your throat, they’re simply spending time together, so Ryuuji maintaining Kushieda as a love interest helps the story feel somewhat believable, despite Taiga’s abuse.

As the plot continues to carve its destructive path, Ami is introduced, and with her, more opportunities for ""contract"" agreements that force characters to be in the same place together despite their apparent misgivings. I'm not sure if Ryuuji is aware that he isn't legally bound by the results of immature high school contests. In any case, the writers continue to create contrived situations that force character interactions that would not otherwise happen.

I liked both Ryuuji and Taiga, despite the unbelievable circumstances that make up their character development. I stated before Ryuuji enjoys cooking and cleaning and is very good at both of them, this detail is the precipitating factor for most of their interactions. Taiga is pretty helpless when it comes to household tasks and Ryuuji provides those services to her. Despite the horribly unrealistic circumstances I felt that Taiga and Ryuuji actually acted in reasonable ways for the most part. Taiga beats Ryuuji frequently but it's clear that she actually does like spending time with him. They're both laughably bad at pursuing their romantic interest but that's pretty typical of high schoolers so it's hardly surprising.

Kushieda is obnoxiously positive. She shares many traits with Ryuuji including domestic competence and is very hard working. I'm sure you've all encountered that person in high school who magically balanced multiple jobs, sports, and school, all while staying unusually cheery. Most of the time she was on screen I just found her really annoying, she's just WAY too positive, there is such a thing. I don't think she was necessarily a bad character, just not the type of character I liked and I wasn't remotely invested in her. I didn't care if Ryuuji made in success in pursuing her because 1. Taiga the obvious romantic interest so you know that nothing's going to happen anyway, and 2. because Ryuuji was such an idiot when it came to trying to win her over that I wanted him to fail. She also becomes the source of more forced drama later on, making it even harder to take seriously and threatening to ruin ending.

Kitamura is the man. At first you get the impression that he's the stereotypical ""obvlivious anime male highschool student"" but he has his own agenda, and it plays out in spectacular fashion. You have not seen a love confession until you’ve seen Kitamura. To be fair, his arc’s only purpose is to help make TaigaxRyuuji a thing, it also results in a fantastic sword fight, but he’s still pretty funny to watch.

Kawashima is introduced later and is absolutely fantastic. She’s far more mature than the rest of the cast due to growing up as a model in the “adult” world, but is stunted in some ways by her air of superiority. Her development was the best part of the show and creates some of the only believable drama between characters. Her conversations with Ryuuji are similarly realistic, they are rarely on the same page but it’s clear to the audience what she’s trying to tell him, which makes their interactions much easier to understand, why Kawashima finds Ryuuji interesting etc.

The biggest mark against the show is that it’s totally drowned in melodrama. Taiga overreacts in ways the get old fast, and the forced pathos ruins the genuinely emotional moments in the show. I need to emphasize this, there were truly some great emotional moments. The Christmas episode with the bear costume (you’ll know it when you see it) [i]almost[/i] caused me to shed a tear, a feat that only Grave of the Fireflies is capable of, but because of the melodrama surrounding most of the show, these scenes lose their effect. Of course, there’s also the incredibly contrived situations (See accidentally overheard conversations/confessions) that bring these scenes about, which doesn’t help.

The production quality was fairly good, I liked the character designs and the animation quality was impressive at times and never bad. Nothing else about its artwork or animation stood out but that’s not terrible in a romcom. The OST was kind of forgettable but does add a lot to the emotion in certain scenes and I wasn’t a fan of the OP/EDs.

Toradora! certainly isn’t bad. Despite its issues it delivers an heartfelt romance with well-defined characters, but the frustration with its asinine story telling was enough to outweigh most of the positive aspects. If you like melodrama, you’ll probably like Toradora!.

One final note, the ending is talked about incessantly, and it is very good. Many complain that it was rushed and didn't explain things well enough, but if you pay attention to the character’s values and motivations, you shouldn’t need the writers to spoon feed you Taiga’s reasons for why she did what she did. Just make sure you watch the last episode all the way through, past the credits and everything."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Toradora can do one thing extremely well: comedy. The characters of Toradora are completely built for playing off each other well in comedic gags. That's why I really loved the first half of Toradora. It had some of the best school comedy scenes I've seen. 

However, at the half way point, after the Culture Festival, it seems that an invisible switch was flipped for the story, where instead of focusing on comedy, the drama would be more prevalent.

Now, there have been many shows that have been able to mix comedy and drama, they even form the genre of ""dramedy"", Kodocha and Clannad to only name
                  ...
two. So I know that the two can be sucessfully spliced. In Toradora's case though, the result is jarring, as the humor seemingly disappears from the show to make room for chick fights, eavesdropping, confessions, and rejections.

The main problem in this transition form comedy to drama is the complete 180 degree turn some of these characters do. Since they were built for comedy, the author/director needed to change them for the drama.

Minorin is a wonderful example. She's super hyperactive and boisterous during the first half of the series. However, by the second half, when the show makes its transformation from comedy to drama, Minorin is just a shell of her character from just a few episodes prior. She broods, mopes, and loses pretty much all of her energy.

How am I supposed to take this story seriously when it seems like there are two different versions of the characters? I just cannot.

Now for the boring statistical review.

Story: 6/10 - The first half was great because, while it included several school cliches, it found a way to be different from all its predecessors. The second half, however, was just cliche, and often convoluted, where it seemed the author just made characters fight with each other for no reason.

Art: 8/10 - The artwork is above average, which seems to be what J.C. Staff strives for. It's not near the level of JC's other series of the Fall, Toaru Majutsu no Index, but it definitely suffices and detail is provided when necessary. 

Sound: 7/10 - I'm a fan of the first opening/ending, but the second set are adequate as well. The BGM is unobtrusive and largely unnoticeable, but that's not really a bad thing.

Character: 7/10 - As I said, these characters are built for comedy. Be it Ryuuji's near-OCD behavior when he happens upon a messy area or Taiga's childish demeanor whenever she sees Kitamura. They're funny. It's too bad that the characters were nearly all completely changed for the second half.

Enjoyment: 6/10 -  I loved the comedy in the first half, but dreaded the poor writing and inconsistency of the characters that plagued the second half. 

Overall: 7/10 - Overall, it's not bad. It's an average romantic comedy in a sea of romantic comedies."

                                      (17/25 eps)","Toradora isn't your story that only focuses on one thing.  Well, at least I don't think so.  It conveys so much meaning to everything that is going on in life.  It shows you that sometimes, even your most important wish, the with you want to come true the most, can sometimes not be reached.  But it also shows some examples of how people decide their path and move on forward. 

Please bear with me.  This is only my third time reviewing.

The story was fantastic.  Even though there are only 24 episodes, which is actually plenty, the story was well
                  ...
developed.  There are no complaints that I can think of right now.  For example, the person you thought you loved just because of the way they act wasn't the one you loved, then comes another person who is a match for you.  That is a good plot on it's own.  That connects to what is going on in the real world.  

The art...  Fantastic.  You could really tell they put a lot of effort into it.  From they're facial expression, even the walking, they put a lot of effort.  Then when the animation shifts to the parts where there is violence, the animation in that part was...  Wow.  That is all I could say.

The sound was great.  Everything, the sound effects were timed well, and the sound tracks matched perfectly with the scenes.  Although for some reason, the first ending song didn't quite get along with me.    But the rest was great.

The characters were really the perfect match with the story.  They're slow development in each episodes connects the viewer in the story that sometimes they might think that they are them.  

The enjoyment...  I enjoyed it very much.  It's not like romance is my highest favorite genre, but I still like it.  Especially in this one.  Also the comedy, some actions, and others were also factors of the enjoyment it brought.

Overall, this show was really great.  I only wish something like this will come in the future."

Toradora is a highly entertaining romantic comedy that successfully escapes the cliched harem tales that dominate the genre. Although it is somewhat let down by mediocre animation and music, the original premise and unforgettable dialogue make Toradora one of the best light hearted romances  of the season.

Story: 8

Toradora is based primarily on the interplay of Takasu and Taiga. A nice guy who has a fearsome reputation due to his aggressive looks, who makes an unlikely pact with a volatile, but cute girl, to help each other succeed with their respective crushes. This premise quite refreshing, and
                  ...
unlike almost all anime within the genre, the male lead is not automatically the object of affection for half a dozen girls.

Unfortunately, the pace of the story is somewhat erratic. There are frequent episodes that seem more `slice of life', with no significant plot development. This, however, is not as bad is it seems, given that the events that do happy in each chapter are often hilarious, and well watching on their own.

Art: 7

Toradora art is not bad... not particularly good. It just does not stand out. While Taiga has a very attractive character design, some supporting characters do look rather bland. The background themselves are also serviceable, but not particularly noteworthy. There's nothing particularly wrong with Toradora's looks, its certainly comparable to that of for example, True Tears or School days. It just doesn't feature that extra level of excellence featured in Clannad or Tale of Memories.

Sound: 8

The voice acting for the characters are well done, and definitely fit their roles. However, the OP and ending themes are rather mediocre. 

Characters: 10

Toradora's main strength is the personality of its cast. Rarely is there a character as unique as Aisaka and Takasu. Their personalities are not only memorable, but also multi-dimensional. While Aisaka, for example, comes across as an arrogant and demanding girl, there are rare moments where her more timid side is briefly shown.

Enjoyament: 10

Toradora is a great anime to watch, and perfect for lifting you from a foul mood. It's both funny and touching, which makes it great for short study or work breaks.

Overall: 9

Despite its technical flaws, Toradora is an excellent example of what a light hearted romantic comedy should be like. Despite its rather exaggerated circumstances, it features an original storyline where the cast are more than just cliches."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"Fairly enjoyable but not really cutting edge.


Overall - 6/10

I personally found Toradora to be somewhat enjoyable to watch but not exactly outstanding.  My biggest gripe was the use of Kugimiya Rie, coupled with J.C.Staff being the producer, which really dampened the potential impact this series.

For people not very informed, Kugimiya Rie has played the role of a tsundere with fairly similar personalities in 4 different anime works (Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Hayate no Gotoku, Zettai Karen Children).  I liked the use of a deeper, lower tone for Taiga and I acknowledge this, but I simply found the (over) use of Rie rather stifling.


Story
                  ...
- 6/10

A fairly normal high school setting which sets the stage for the intriguing characters to work on.  The story is really character-driven and while the characters do a great job, the background course of events are less than stellar, like as if a B-rate movie writer did it.  The events of the Cultural Festival, and the Ski Trip were really touching, and that made me almost raise the rating to 7.  However, the pacing seems to drag on over the winter period but feels rather rushed towards the end with bits and pieces missing.  I just didn't feel really satisfied with this.


Character - 8/10

I really enjoyed the cast and the way they transformed over the course of the series.  We get given characters with rather eccentric personalities which work nicely with everyone else.  There is good coverage of the thoughts, feelings and the transformation that occurs in the main leads and that is really pleasing to see.  I would personally liked to have seen more airtime for Ami's personality growth as she's probably the deepest person in the entire cast, and the ""answer"" to her was really rushed.  Overall a really great, and enjoyable cast.

The Seiyuu for Ryuuj/Nojima Hirofumi put in a solid performance but my pick of the lot is Minorin/Horie Yui who really brought up Minorin's eccentricity and hyperactivity in an excellent fashion.  My gripe with Taiga has already been mentioned.


Sound - 7/10

Nothing fancy in the BGM but I really loved the OP themes.  The two OPs really conveyed the mood of the story as it changed from one to another.  The timing in which OP2 was introduced was perfect.


Enjoyment - 6/10

My enjoyment in Toradora was closely linked with the story.  Unfortunately, despite the characters which gave me great joy worthy of an 8, the story felt really dragged out, so at the end of it all I feel it's a mildly enjoying show overall, but not one where my mind would get totally transfixed to.


Art and Animation - 6/10

Fairly good and consistent.  It's no KyoAni but does the job."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Toradora is criminally overrated. It's very rare that I find an anime that lacks anything decent but Toradora is most certainly one. I truly loathe this anime and the support it gets. 

I usually don't look at reviews and ratings of anime before I watch them so that I am able to have an unbiased and unspoilt opinion when watching the anime. So, after enduring the agony of the anime I went on a few forums and saw a few reviews. After watching the anime and thinking that it was a steaming pile of garbage it was to my dismay that I saw endless romcom
                  ...
thirsty viewers saying it was ""Their favorite anime"" and that it's ""the most underrated anime ever"". I despise myself for wasting even a second of my time enduring this anime and write this review in the hope that even one person saves themselves from the torture that is Toradora. 

To begin with, the characters are unbelievably hate-able and predictable. I absolutely detest Taiga and everything she stands for, words cannot describe how much hate i feel for this woman and her actions. Ryuuji is the most boring typical anime protagonist that serves no benefit to anyone's existence other than Taiga and his mother with whom he has an oddly borderline incestuous relationship with but not enough for it to be an interesting hentai. Minori is another typical loud and annoying airhead anime girl although she provides some moments of joy within the depressing rage that is Taiga. Yuusaku has some sort of pathetic breakdown in the middle of the series and remains an unpleasant and unnecessary character throughout the series. Ami is simply a conceited swine that is incredibly forgettable and abhorrent. 

The ending of the anime is one of the most pathetic endings I've seen in anime. It's as if the series defecated all over you and then just left. It removes what little purpose the entire series had by separating the two main characters and somehow passing that as some sort of tragedy. The show seems to label itself as a comedy, there was not a single instant within the show where I so much as smiled. The support that it gets from the community makes me lose faith in humanity and dislike the show even more.

I beg of you, if you have any sense of self respect, do not watch Toradora. I am not an unpleasant person in the slightest but Toadora brings out theworst in me. There are endless amounts of anime under the same genre that you could watch which are infinitely better."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"It seems JC Staff loves to makes animes out of light novel publications from ASCII Media Works. Toradora! is one of their newest adaptations, and in the genre of romance/comedy that has been overdone extensively already, I am pleased to say that this anime has exceeded my expectations greatly.

Story: There is nothing extraodinary about the story in Toradora, I dare say its a cliched scenario of the 2 main characters being together for all the series to find out in the end they love each other. However the way Toradora excecutes and delivers this story was done so well that even if the outcomes and
                  ...
events looked predictable, it would still keep you on your toes and make you want more.

Animation: This anime's strong point was not on the visual department, however it was still well animated and throughout the show we would be treated to a very rich and colorful anime that was pleasing to the eyes.

Music: Toradora proves that you dont need an awesome soundtrack to make an anime sound fantastic. Apart from a couple of tunes from the OST, there is really no standout songs in the show. However the songs are used so well in the anime they are able to really enhance the enjoyment of important scenes, making the show much more enjoyable. Also very solid voice acting, as expected from a top class voice actress as Kugimiya Rie but I was also highly impressed with Majima Junji's role as Ryuuji. Perfectly excecuted.

Characters: This is by far the show's best aspect. Not every anime is able to deliver such likeable characters and make them blend together so well. Throughout the series I was in constant debate on which of the main heroines I liked most, because the anime manages to develop every character so well. Even the supporting characters are very likeable, and are well developed in this show. And to my surprise, for this genre of anime the show managed to deliver a main male lead that I did not find a complete idiot.

Enjoyment: Man this show has been a blast to watch, every week I would go thinking they couldnt top last week's episode yet they still managed to do it almost every time. This is definitely one of my new favourites animes.

Overall: In the romance/comedy category, it is very easy for an anime to fall into the ""overdone"" category, despite all that, Toradora is able to keep a refreshing and interesting pace for most of its run and for that I salute JC Staff for this brilliant adaptation to a great novel. This anime proves that even if you dont have a groundbreaking plot, if you are able to provide an excellent execution with what you have you can still produce a top quality anime. If you are looking for a great romcom that is able to set itself apart from others and is able to maintain a great level of entertainment and quality, then I am sure Toradora will not disappoint you and I highly recommend it to anyone."

And the scary guy is head over heals for his odd, softball playing classmate. Both Taiga and Ryuj are unable to convey their feelings to the person they have feeling for.

So why the low score? Let's just say, I despised the ending. In order to keep from revealing anything, I won't say why. I loved the show up till the end of episode 19. Certain events took place that made me hate the show with a burning passion. That doesn't stop me from suggesting it to everyone else though. Most people liked it, and I bet you will too!"

Guess it is slice of life after all."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"When you think of a romance, comedy, school life/slice of life, you think about an anime with two (or more) lovers as they go through thick and thin together. That certainly does not fit the description of Toradora!. In fact, I don't think anything is able to describe just how funny, touching, deep, and serious Toradora! is. 

I started watching Toradora! after reading the first few chapters of the manga. At first, I thought it was one of those series focusing purely on romance and comedy. I thought it was a carefree series that will bring watchers some laughs with some moments of romance. The
                  ...
first few episodes did seem to be leaning toward this direction. However, as the story develops, I was blown away. The story and characters were so complex, fascinating, and unique that the description of a ""carefree comedy romance anime"" just can't fit Toradora!. Not at all.

The story, at its introduction, is simple. Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga both have crushes on the other's friend. They decide to help each other. Really simple, and predictable right? Nope. As the story propels forward, so many wild and heartwarming events occur make the relationships between the friends not so clear. The story moves along a very smooth pace as well. Like other comedy/romance anime, Toradora! develops the story w/ episodic events. Unlike the others however, it blends the main plot and each event very well, so that you'll never see just an event (such as a house party or summer trip) that's just there for enjoyment. In Toradora!, the events drive the story, not the other way around.

What makes the story so much exciting, unpredictable, and anticipated are the wonderful characters of Toradora!. At the onset, the characters are introduced, and each have an obvious trait/personality that you have no problem identifying. Takasu is mean-looking and scares people, but he really is the ideal guy: nice, reliable, friendly. Kushieda Minori is the cheerful girl and Aisaka's best friend who is always energized and lighting up the mood. However, there is so much more than just that. As the story progresses, the characters do as well. Each character faces trials and obstacles in the story. As a result, they develop, change, and gradually become different. In addition, each character has inner feelings and pasts that influence their way of dealing with things. 

As you watch each episode, the main cast is so well created that you'll forget they're just figures of fiction. You will treat them as real beings, sympathizing with one and perhaps disapproving another. Your own feelings will change as the characters change. All of this leads to a wonderful experience that is Toradora!.

The art is well drawn. Backgrounds are clear, colorful, and sharp. Character movement is smooth. The sound is rendered and timed perfectly. Each background song/sound fits with the scene, and adds strength to it. The opening and ending songs are also very well chosen, perfectly fitting with the general theme of Toradora!.

I have greatly enjoyed Toradora!. I had average expectations and saw some potential in Toradora! when I started watching it in Oct. 08, when the Fall 2008 season came out. Unlike so many other anime that start with great beginning but only to degenerate, Toradora! shot through the roof of mediocrity with its great characters and story. It satisfied many viewers and went on to become even better as each week passed. Now that I've seen all 25 episodes, I must say, it was an incredible series."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Toradora is easily one of the worst anime around. It can't decide if its a romance/comedy or a romance/drama. Combine that with some of the worst characters ever and you have the final product.

Story:
The story is bland. It has been done so many times before the word cliché doesn't do it justice. You know the ending within the first 5 minutes of episode 1. 

It is very slow-paced. A 25 episode series that could have very easily been done in 15. It spends time on pointless scenes that are irrelevant to the main series and feel more like a filler episode of a popular long-running
                  ...
shounen.

I will admit, the comedy scenes at the beginning were funny. However, an intelligent viewer will quickly realise the comedy is playing off of the female MC's tsundere archetype and the jokes become painful to watch. 

The drama was forced and melodramatic, especially for a series not even tagged as a drama on MAL. The feeble attempts to provoke an emotional response were poorly written and painful to watch.

Art:
The animation isn't bad but it isn't good. The backgrounds are decent but there is nothing particularly memorable regarding the art.

Sound:
The series use two opening themes which would have been very fitting if it hadn't had so much melodrama which makes the themes seem more suitable for a series with more comedy.

The OST is average at best. The composer didn't really have his own style which made the music seem bland and uninspired. 

Some of the songs fit the scene but you won't notice them unless you focus on the music.

Character:
The worst part of Toradora.

The male MC is a teenager who is isolated from his class mates because of his appearance. You know who else doesn't have any friends? Otaku.
He is too shy to tell a girl he likes her. You know who else is very shy? Otaku.
You can see where I am going with this.
The male MC is basically otaku-pandering.
I also view the MC as being a poor rip-off of Clannad's male MC. They both have few friends and are considered delinquents and both have blue hair. 

The female MC is easily the worst character ever written. She is the personification of the tsundere archetype which shows poor writing and a lack of creativity of the author's part. By the time the show gets started on her character development you already hate her so much you don't care. Additionally, all her issues in the show could be resolved if she stopped being a bitch. Her voice actor only makes matters worse. Its Rie Kugimiya, need I say more?

The side character are a mixed bag. Minori is just as bad as Taiga but for different reasons. Namely a bipolar personality and generally being an annoyance. The other two ,Kitamura and Ami, are actually decent but are thrown to the side for the worse characters.

Enjoyment:
It took me two months to finish this, purely because I don't drop shows. I felt my IQ getting lower as I watched each episode. It isn't enjoyable. I'm certain that listening to Rie Kugimiya's voice is a method of torture at guantanamo bay.

Overall:
It could have been a decent show if the story wasn't so cliché and the characters weren't so poorly written. It had some good scenes that were held back by reasons previously stated. Scenes that seem significant later become redundant and everything is so predictable. As a fan of the romance genre I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Toradora .. it is considered one of the best romance anime of all time .. well i disagree. I only saw a couple of romances and i already saw 3 romances that for me were better than Toradora. 


Why this anime for me is over rated? Well it has nothing special to offer .. pretty usual, pretty normal, the romance is predictable, well nothing here excels in my opinion. 


Story: 7/10. I only gave a 7 to the story because we have a interesting way of starting an anime. The rest ? Clichê. Everything ! Not even one character is original, everyone are clichê and
                  ...
not even one is interesting. I kinda guessed the end when i was in the 4th ep or so .. and I did it right, the end was just what I expected to be ... why is that? BECAUSE IT'S A ********* clichê and like every clichê out there, they are predictable and boring. But still the story is good enough.. there is no plot holes, everything fits right. 

Art: 6/10. Really really crappy art. The characters look ugly.. it seems that they just changed the size of the boobs, the hair colour and the eyes colour between the female characters. Look on the web and see if i'm not right. There is even 2 characters that i just could distinguish by hearing their voices... -.-. The background is also pretty bad. But .. the design i think it's well done after all and fits well with the character's personality. 

Sound: 8/10. Actually the best aspect here. It makes the comedy moments much more fun. The voice acting is pretty good also. The openings are funny especially the first one. About the OST, they fit nice and i found no problems on them .. Although the OST for the drama could be better .. it's pretty smooth for me xD 

Character: 8/10. Like i said they all are clichê characters .. predictable movements, predictable choices, predictable reactions .. where is the fun watching this? But i do have to say they have a nice development, all of them have a different personality and it's interesting seeing the interaction between the characters. But again, they are clichês so as their background stories. I was having a deja'vu every time they explained some character's past. 

Enjoyment: 8/10. It is a clichê .. but at least it's funny to watch and entertains well. Although .. because i already had predicted the end, the romane got extremely weak for me, and it looked pretty rough, i mean at least i don´t like that type of romance. I'm one of those who likes cute things. I can´t lie to you, i saw this anime in 3 days so i had fun while i was watching that's for sure. But it's because it is a comedy show with some drama on it. 

Overall: 7/10. I'm being generous giving this anime a 7/10. I like to get suprised and here i got everything right. To much predictable, at least for me it sucks. Although for a comedy is nice, for a slice of life is also good. But i advise you, if you heard the same as i ""Toradora is one of the best romances of all time"" .. IT'S WRONG. For me, it was just a normal romance, so it can´t be the best. So don´t get hype for then get disappointment like i had. 

If you like romance/comedy/slice of life, this is a good show .. but not one of the best romance animes. It just looks pretty normal to be one of the best."

And if anyone could actually see it, there’d be a whole bunch of people wanting to have it.  Maybe that’s why the world keeps it hidden from everyone...  Because if it’s that hard to get, that makes it even more special.  And one day, someone will find it.  Whoever does find it, they’ll be the one that was supposed to.  Because that’s the way it’s meant to be.

Ryuji Takesu is trying to find this something...  He’s in love with
                  ...
an energetic girl in his class, but his reputation as the second scariest student in the school has kept him at a distance from her.  One day, the first scariest student in the school slips a love note into his bag by mistake, and the two of them realize that they’re in love with each others’ best friends.  By joining forces in the pursuit of their unrequited loves, can this tiger and dragon finally find that one thing that they long to see?

Well, once again, we’re returning to JC Staff, although this series is an entirely different creature than the two shows I’ve reviewed before.  It combines the budget allocation from Ghost Hunt with the hyper-cheap aesthetic from Ookami-san to some surprisingly great effect.  It’s not what you’d call a great looking series, as movement is limited, but for the most part, the movement it DOES showcase is smooth and kinetic.  The only time it really becomes ugly is during a few of the biggest emotional moments of the show, and their attempt to get as much movement as possible out of the characters leads to frameless, poorly drawn monsters that look absolutely hilarious when paused.  But luckily, those moments are few and far between, and the high emotions involved are enough to overpower and revulsion these images may cause.

As for the artwork, it’s above average.  The character designs are brilliant, with inspired looks and bright, sharp color choices keeping the entire cast fresh in your mind for days after you finish the series, but outside of that, it’s pretty standard slice-of-life stuff.  The CG, at least in the few moments that they choose to employ it, is flawlessly done, so it’s pretty easy to pick out where a good chunk of the budget went.  The only aspect of the artwork that really bothered me were the constant jagged outlines around the characters, which is not an uncommon problem in anime from around the late aughts...  Even Brotherhood and Spice and Wolf suffered from it.  That problem is completely erased if you’re watching it on Blu-ray, however.

In any case, the show does it’s job visually, as all the extra effort in the animation makes for some impeccable comic timing, and the lighting and color scheme suddenly become gorgeous whenever there’s a romantic scene to showcase.  The facial expressions are detailed and dynamic enough to make Kyoto Animation eat it’s heart out, which is important because in a lot of ways, the characters are the most important part of the show.  The main characters... The ones who appear most prominently in the opening...  Take the standard love triangle and evolve it into a full blown love pentagon, with enough plotting and emotional nuance that each one of them is as important to the unfolding drama as the next.  

Our central character, Ryuji Takesu, is a hopeless romantic who’s been mistaken for a scary thug because of his tough face and quiet demeanor.  If that sounds familiar to you, it’s because his character was ripped off wholesale by a series that I like to call “Haganai: I Don’t Have Many Original Ideas.”  He’s the standard nice guy rom-com lead, but there’s more to him than others of his ilk...  He was raised by a very childish single parent, which lead to him becoming the responsible housewife she could never be...  He cooks, fusses, and is an obsessive neat-freak who can’t stand to let dirt or mold sit unchallenged.  His personality may not resonate with everyone, but that’s what’s so wonderful about it...  He actually has personality traits that aren’t just positive gimmicks, and the majority of the people surrounding him actually DO find him weird because of it.  He’s not the glorified perfect guy everyone loves, and after Kyo-Ani’s domination of the market, that’s pretty refreshing.

The other main character is Taiga Aisaka, a tiny girl who’s actually earned her frightful reputation.  Blunt and brutal, she’s been given the diminutive nickname “The Palmtop Tiger.”  At first glance, she may appear to be some calculated pander to the fans of the lolicon and tsundere archetypes, and I can kind of understand where people who say this are coming from.  But as the story progresses, and you learn more about her family situation, her tough nature becomes more and more understandable, and it also becomes very clear that her physical shortcomings are a thing that she has to overcompensate for.  Yeah, you can condemn her as being a shallow grab at the loli market, but the truth is, I knew plenty of girls like her in school, so it’s hard for me to become offended when one of them is very accurately represented in a story.  She’s the most complex and (ironically) the most developed character in the cast, so it makes sense that she’s become the posterchild for the series.

Their friends(and initial love interests) are Yusaku Kitamura and Minori Kushieda, two lovable oddballs who are active in a lot of school activities.  Yusaku is a relatively simple character, and in the beginning, he’s the only one who knows that Taiga and Ryuji are good people.  This probably has something to do with his involvement in student council, as he seems to be the kind of person who makes an effort to get to know everybody.  Despite being a little simple, he does have his problems, and he does get his own arc, and they don’t disappoint.  Minori is the class’s genki girl, a bright ball of energy who tries her best in everything she does, is highly perceptive of other peoples’ true feelings, and holds about a dozen jobs outside of school.  She can be annoying to some viewers, but while it’s never fully explored, it’s implied several times throughout the anime that she has a wealth of issues below the surface, and that she may secretly suffer from poverty, or even severe depression in her home life.  Whatever the case, the only ones who never really believe in her sunny exterior are herself and...

My favorite character in the show, Ami Kawashima.  When she’s introduced to the story, it’s as a sort of villain...  Or, at least, an antagonist.  She’s a bratty, arrogant model who puts on a much more manufactured, moe-like facade in order to manipulate people, and if you’re the kind of person who can’t stand all the infantilized doe-eyed ladies of the Key Trinity, you’ll be laughing right along with her over it.  As she develops, and we learn more about why she transferred to this school and why she is the way she is, she’s eventually forced to drop her act, at which point she becomes arguably the most important character in the series. She becomes an almost Shakespearian character, a fifth wheel who’s free to observe the web of lies going on between her cast mates.  She takes an active role in the story, pulling strings and making calculated comments, getting way too involved as she tries to unravel the truth behind it all.

The supporting cast is used with surprising efficiency, as none of them are featured any more or less than they need to be.  Characters like The Student council President, Inko the brain-damaged parrot, and the parents of our two central characters exist not only to augment the comedy or drama of the material, but to drop subtle hints about why the characters are the way they are.  Characters like Miss Koigakubo and four other select students exist to deliver some stunning paralells in regards to what’s going on in the main story, as well as to serve as a constant reminder that there’s a world outside of Taiga's circle.  

Toradora is one of a small list of shows that I’ve seen in both English and Japanese, and even though I may be woefully monolingual, I can personally attest to the fact that both tracks are nothing short of pure gold.  I can’t really say anything about the Japanese track that a simple list of names wouldn’t say all on it’s own, as I don’t think anybody is a virgin to the works of people like Rie Kugimiya and Yui Horie, but the English dub really doesn’t have that kind of star power, so it does merit a bit more discussion.

In recent years, Bang Zoom Entertainment has taken to pushing it’s main stable to the back row, and instead giving some of it’s best roles to a series of newer actors that haven’t gotten nearly as much work in the past.  This transition was a little rocky at first, with projects like K-On and Oblivion Island at the forefront, and some decent yet rather awkward acting in Madoka Magica.  Well, Toradora was their moment, and they rose to it, putting forth better performances than I could have possibly imagined.  They all far surpassed the relatively little work they’ve previously done, and after hearing them in this, I sincerely hope this stable becomes the next big industry powerhouse.  

Going in, I already  had respect for Cassandra Lee’s ability to understand her characters, as her performances in both K-On and Madoka Magica were outstanding, but I felt Taiga’s depth was out of her range… And I never really liked Christine Marie Cabanos, although she was decent in Squidgirl. I wasn’t initially expecting much, but this dub is literally perfect. And yes, I know what I’m implying by putting the word literally before the word perfect… Believe me, I mean it that way. I can’t imagine any cast coming together for Toradora better than this one did. All of those actors I’d never heard of before… Like Erika Herlacher and Erik Kimerer… Are names I’m going to be looking out for from now on. Cassandra Lee has only strengthened my confidence in her abilities, and as for Cabanos? I take back every negative thing I ever said about her. She is the star of this dub, and as such, I don’t want to live in a world where her performance is anything other than star-making. Every inch of her becomes Minori Kushieda, from her sunny and boisterous exterior all the way down to her complex, insecure interior.  She’s apparently found her niche in loud, energetic characters, so I hope she keeps getting roles like that one.

There are a handful of seasoned veterans among the cast, with Johnny Yong Bosch and Karen Strassman pulling off performances that are about what you’d expect from them...  Which is a good thing, mind you.  And even though she’s playing multiple second-string roles, like that weird parrot-thing, Wendee Lee hasn’t sounded this good since Cowboy Bebop.

So, right from the first episode, or just from a simple explanation of the plot, most viewers will give this show a dismissive wave and say that it sounds too predictable.  “Okay, so they’re in love with each others’ best friends, but they’re going to wind up falling in love with each other, right?”  I have literally sat and watched this with a first time viewer who said pretty much this, and then throw his hands up in defeat after about eight episodes of NOTHING going the way he predicted it would.  And that’s part of the genius of this series.  The characters are familiar, the tropes are familiar, the setting is familiar, but none of it is ever played the way you’d expect it to be played.  Take any problem that the romantic comedy/harem genre may have, and Toradora either avoids it completely or turns it upside down.

For example, there’s the harem aspet.  It’s a trend in way too many shows that nearly every female character in the cast will inexplicably fall head over heels in love with the male protagonist, ignoring all other options as not being main enough for them.  This is one of the biggest issues I had with Sword Art Online and Clannad, but it’s not just a numbers issue...  In Tiger and Bunny, the main character had ONE girl fawning over him, and it was still bugged me by being completely unexplained.  In Toradora, yes, the three main girls have feelings for Ryuji, but there are a few things that set this series apart...  First off, it’s only those three characters.  Second, all three of these love interests are explained in story, either explicitly or with subtlety, and they’re all played out differently.  And finally, Ryuji’s not the only eligible bachelor in the show...  His friend Yusaku gets just as much attention, and hell, the first character in the named cast to get a significant other is one of their classmates!

Another example is that in most harem shows, particularly the ones adapted from dating games (Which Toradora thankfully wasn’t), the story seems disjointed, as each character gets their own arc while the main relationship just sits on the backburner until all the filler is done and the writers are damn well good and ready to just get to the point already.  But Toradora’s story is, however, VERY tightly written.  There is not a single story arc in the single freaking series that doesn’t somehow involve Taiga and Ryuji and their ever-developing dynamic, nor does the central plot ever get forgotten.  The other three mains may occasionally take a backseat, but they never disappear from a story completely.  

Hell, when you get down to it, all the little things that make up your typical romantic comedy are here...  But they’re used in new, clever, often subversive ways that are never just there for the sake of being checked off of a tropes list.  Everything that you’d expect to see in a show like this...  From bathing suit shopping to the obligatory beach episode...  Is executed in a way that’s fresh, unique, and important to the story.  Hell, where most anime are happy to settle on a cafe or a haunted house for their culture fest episode, Toradora goes balls-out with a professional wrestling show, complete with faces, heels, an over-the-top script and choreographed in-ring action!  We never see any characters in the bath, because no matter what a lot of other shows may think, no on screen conversation ever NEEDS to take place in the bath.  There’s a little bit of fanservice, but it’s never gratuitous...  Except for a dream that one of the side characters has right before the Christmas arc, which was funny enough to be excusable...  And it’s offset by a heaping helping of manservice, often willingly supplied by the unnervingly confident Yusaku, and even then, it’s played entirely for laughs.  

But if I had to pick out one thing that makes this series stand out over the tops of all the other rom-coms out there, it would be exactly that...  Confidence.  Toradora is one hundred percent confident in the quality of the material it has to offer, and unlike a lot of other shows that value enthusiasm over ability, it’s smart enough to know that it’s confidence is well founded.  It never doubts itself, nor does it ever assume that YOU doubt it, and it never slows down or breaks it’s outstanding pace to try and convince you otherwise.  It’s this confidence that gives Toradora it’s energy.  Well, that, and the amazing soundtrack.

Toradora has an unwavering, dazzling energy just radiating from it at every moment of screen time.  That energy never goes away, even during the more tear-jerking scenes, because it never screws around...  Instead of pop culture references, Toradora casually rolls out references and metaphors related to it’s own universe.  Where there are plenty of anime that fall into the trap of stopping their stories dead to show you backstory episodes you don’t care about for characters who are just going to fade into the background afterwards...  His and Her Circumstances was particularly bad about this...  Toradora doesn’t, because it knows that you’ll care about the characters anyway.  It never does anything just because it feels like it should, nor does it ever show us anything just because we might want to see it.  The only time it really slows down is towards the end, and it only does it then because it has one hell of a perfect post-credits ending to close on.

Toradora was originally released on a pair of undubbed DVDs by Sentai Filmworks, and while those DVDs were just fine and dandy...  Once again, the sub is great all on it’s own...  I would still highly recommend purchasing the DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack that was released last year by NIS America.  It’s pricey, but it comes with a full color fan book and a generous helping of special features, including the cute and charming Hooray for Foodies mini-sodes.  It also comes with a short video of some of the impressions that Taiga made Ami do, and a dubbed OVA episode about the magic of making bento boxes, but I’ll be honest, they were both kind of disappointing.  The OVA wasn’t necessarily bad, but it would have dragged down the series if it had actually been included.  You can also stream the entire series, in either language, on Crunchyroll!

Toradora isn’t just great, it’s glowing.  With the exception of the animation, which is at the very least better than it has any right to be, there is nothing this series does wrong.  At twenty five episodes long, it’s as fun to rewatch as any other show with half the episode count.  The high rewatch quality doesn’t stop there, either, as the comedic and dramatic material are both so effective and so timeless that I still found myself constantly laughing and choking up after seven entire viewings.  It takes some of the worst things about the romantic comedy and harem genres and proves just how amazing those things can become with a little bit of effort, focus, and tender loving care.  I won’t say whether or not the characters found that mysterious ‘thing’ they were looking for, but I found what I was looking for...  The best anime romantic comedy ever made.  I give Toradora a 10/10."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Romantic Comedies are some of the most common stories in modern entertainment, there never seems to be a shortage of them. Naturally, the genre can often be stale, relying on the same old tired formula over and over again. Some try to change things up with peculiar or supernatural circumstances, but more often than not just come off gimmicky. But every once in a while a really good romantic comedy comes out that reminds people of the value of the genre. Toradora is definitely one of these.

The story follows two high school misfits, Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, and their developing friendship. Ryuji is misunderstood
                  ...
by his schoolmates because of his intimidating appearance; in reality he is actually responsible nice guy (albeit certainly not a social butterfly). Taiga, on the other hand, despite her petite appearance is a real trouble child. She has a fierce and anti-social demeanor, and does not hesitate to put a beating to anyone who crosses her. These two are brought together because each has a crush on the other's best friend. They make an agreement to help one another win the hearts of their respective crushes. However, this is a lot harder done than said, as neither really has a clue about relationships. At the same time, they begin to find comfort in their makeshift friendship.

Admittedly, there is not anything particularly special about this set-up, and the story is actually quite predictable. You would have to be blind not to see how it ends from the moment Taiga and Ryuji meet. The funny thing is, though, none of that really matters. The real joy of Toradora lies in its presentation. Where other romantic comedies might rely on a quick gimmick to distinguish themselves from their kin, Toradora does not. What it does rely on, refreshingly enough, is quality writing and strong characterization.

Toradora has a nice balance of comedy and drama. The show can have you laughing one moment, then knock you down with hard hitting emotion the next. Silly misunderstandings, romantic rivalries, and other traits of the genre are utilized to develop characters in unexpected ways. Take for example the swimming contest between Taiga and her then rival Ami. It provided plenty of comedic moments that were amusing on their own, but also created a situation that further deepens Taiga and Ryuji's relationship as well. The way Toradora squeezes in character development at every opportunity is the key to its success. It turns what would otherwise be standard romantic comedy and school-life fair into something special.

The characters themselves, at first appearance, look like little more than a collection of tropes. Taiga is clearly a tsundere from the moment she appears, and there is not much that separates Ryuji from other protagonists. Taiga's best friend (Ryuji's crush) Minori is a hyperactive athlete; Ryuji's best friend (Taiga's crush) is an odd but popular student council member; and transfer student Ami serves as a rival to the tiny Taiga. Though they do not seem like anything special at first, they develop into well-rounded believable characters as the story progresses. Taiga's violent disposition becomes understandable as her numerous family problems are revealed; her tsudere tendencies are utilized convincingly to portray her as an aggressively guarded teenage girl. As energetic and weird as Minori is, she is more than just comedic relief, her hyperactive demeanor hides surprising depth. The two-faced Ami can come off as a bitch, but also has a side that is a sympathetic, and is remarkably well developed and interesting all on her own. While not as colorful in personality as the girls, Ryuji is an endearing lead whose presence never becomes bothersome. The rest of the cast is equally as likeable, though none shine as bright as the main cast.

Being in the slice-of-life genre, it is easy what to expect from Toradora visually. However, even here, the show delivers exceptionally well. Character designs are quite attractive; even though they are not particularly unconventional, there is a certain flair to them. The body language and facial expressions of each character is what brings them to life visually. Simlpy by the way they carry themselves and the way they move, it is easy to get a feel of who these characters are. Facial expressions are pivotal in conveying emotion, and it is clear Toradora's animators knew this, as they carefully handled the characters' exceptionally expressive faces to carry the subtlest of emotion.

Not to be outdone, the show's soundtrack is equally as impressive, if not even more so. While again not unconventional in the realm of slice-of-life anime, the music is magnificently composed. From the bubbly electrical pieces used in everyday school life scenes, to the fully orchestrated ones used in the show's emotional climaxes, every beat is a joy to listen to. This music is used masterfully, fitting the tone of every scene perfectly; becoming engraved with the emotion each contained. Even the transition into the charming J-pop ending themes is incredibly well done and memorable.

It is apparent that Toradora is not so much groundbreaking as it is incredibly well executed. It does not do anything especially innovative with its narrative, in fact, utilizing genre conventions. However, at the end of the day, such criticisms pale in comparison overwhelming merits of the show. It is inviting, funny, heartfelt, and overflowing with emotion. It easily stands proud among the best of its genre."

-Insert forever alone meme-

Good high school romantic comedies can be a lot of fun to watch. The bad ones, on the other hand, have the tendency to annoy viewers with tired clichés and are often neither romantic nor funny. Without a doubt, the anime title Toradora! falls into the first category. It not only contains some touching romance and hilarious comedy, but is also beautifully animated and cleverly scripted, making it a highly energetic and entertaining series.
                  ...


Takasu Ryuuji dislikes the way his eyes look: menacing and rebellious. It is the first day of his second year in high school, and he is trying to change his appearance to match his kind personality. At school, Ryuuji bumps into a short girl who is known for bringing trouble, Aisaka Taiga. After a long turn of events, Taiga reveals that she likes Kitamura Yuusaku, one of Ryuuji’s few friends and Ryuuji then reciprocates by revealing to her that he likes Taiga’s friend, Kushieda Minori. They decide to make a pact in which Taiga will help Ryuuji confess to Minori if he becomes her “dog”.

The character designs on the whole are simple but attractive, and each each character's animation helps to communicate his or her personality: Ryuuji's slumped posture, Minori's exuberance, and Ami's haughty cool can be read equally well from their body language as from their dialogue. Far and away, the most visual sugar gets sprinkled on Aisaka Taiga; whether she be sleeping, toweling her hair, or using a doughnut as a halo, she looks fantastic.

Sound-wise, you have catchy opening and ending themes set alongside beautifully animated sequences. It's all a beautiful riot of colors and is extremely well-timed. The BGM is alright in my opinion; there's a few memorable pieces such several piano themes and guitar pieces that really compliment a few of scenes. They bring out the emotions of the characters and really strike the feeling home. Otherwise, the music didn't catch my attention too much. The voice acting is extremely well done, delivering the dialogues with all the right emotions.

I could go on and on about the characters but I'll try to keep it brief. The personalities and interactions of the characters really brings this entire show above the normal threshold for such a genre. Though they seem cookie-cutter in the beginning, it quickly changes as the story continues and they gain a level of depth and believability. You become so invested in their endeavors and become invested in their goals, especially in Ryūji and Taiga. The side characters are a little more predictable, but they each have their levels of depth that make the show enjoyable to watch

To put it simply, Toradora is a good anime. There's a great mix between comedy and romance, although sometimes the melodrama could be over the top if you're not used to it. The pacing of the story is done well and the cast of characters are charming and entertaining to watch. One gripe would probably be that the ending left a little more to be desired. It was a little out of the blue and for a second I was worried that the characters would make all the wrong choices but they pulled through in the end!

The people I've seen talk about Toradora! tend to get fixated on either half of the show, which is a horrible mistake. Taken as a whole, this work's honesty and humor paints a picture of high school romance and heartbreak that rings true. The loving, detailed visuals, laid back atmosphere and modest scope make the series a perfect introduction to the romance genre and a standout anime in its own right. No matter how angry it makes me at one moment, the next scene or episode has me singing its praises. In short, Toradora! is a lot like it's subject matter: In turns hilarious, rambling, confused, charming, and foolish, but ultimately a worthwhile and heartwarming experience.

Especially given that Toraodra has a reputation attached to it that’s never going to change. But I don’t fucking care, I feel as if I don’t write a review and get my thoughts out there in some capacity, I’m gonna go mental or some shit. Regardless, consider this my hate letter to Toradora, my least favorite anime of all time. I can certainly think of worse shows, but I can’t think of a series that I absolutely detest to the level I do this one. You
                  ...
could sum up every hater in the world of my top 10 anime, put me in a room with them, and they still wouldn’t compare to the utter disdain I house for this series, without further ado let’s get this out of the way so I can hopefully not think about this series anymore unless it’s gets brought up in conversation.

Reason I hate Toradora #1: The art

I fucking hate the art of this series, the overall presentation is a blurry mess & the colors are drab overall. I also hate the uniform designs for the girls. I have nothing against the color red, but the way the uniforms stand out from the background (which I get is the point), something about it just pisses me off to no end, I’m not sure if it’s the kind of red they used or what, but I think it looks ugly. Speaking of ugly, the character designs, holy fuck are these character designs hideous. They’re either incredibly basic & look like very little effort went into them. Either that or they just look like your typical light novel character (which yes, I do know Toradora was a light novel adaptation) with absolutely no deviation, Taiga’s hair going all the way down to her back certainly checks out here. Honest to god I think the character design from Garzey’s Wing is 100000x times more appealing than the character designs in Toradora, because I at least don’t get disgusted whenever I look at them. Garzey’s Wing also doesn’t rely on the tried & true tactic of giving all their main characters different hair color to make them stand out. I don’t think Toradora using multiple hair colors is an inherently bad thing to be honest, after all shows like Gurren Lagann exist & I believe that series to have excellent character designs. But where Gurren Succeeded where Toradora fails is that Gurren’s characters don’t look like designs ripped out of every light novel ever made. The colors in Gurren are also rich with detail where as I mentioned earlier, the colors in Toradora are drab, bleak, and shitty.

Reason I hate Toradora #2: Comedy

Toradora has got to be the most obnoxious and unfunny series I have ever seen. The comedy relies almost entirely on nothing but random nonsense & Taiga being small but fierce, which wasn’t funny the first time, & isn’t funny any time after that. Toradora also doesn’t do toneshifts well. Comedy will usually come after a very dramatic sequence of events, sort of similar to 3-gatsu no lion. As ashamed of myself as I am that I just put 3-gatsu on the level of Toradora for a quick second, I’m about to lay my shame to rest by explaining why 3-gatsu works and why Toradora fails. 3-gatsu works because there’s build up to the more comedic & lighthearted scenes of the series after all the tense character drama. Once the character drama in 3-gatsu is over the series will usually create an establishing shot or use a line of dialogue that will lead into preparing the viewer for the comedic scene so that it doesn’t feel out of nowhere. In Toradora on the other hand, there is almost never an establishing moment for such a thing, so the tone-shift just feels like it comes out of nowhere & makes the scenes awkward and all the dramatic tension that could’ve been had is now gone thanks to the bad tone-shifts. Toradora also has a certain red-haired bitch who I will mention later in the review later on to use for comedy, but it never goes anything beyond the most stereotypical and exaggerated air headed character in anime history. To sum up why I hate Toradora’s comedy in 3 words ‘Annoying”, ‘Random”, “Over Exaggerated”.

Reason I hate Toradora #3 The characters

I HATE Toradora’s characters. I used to think Ranma ½ had the most annoying cast of characters in all of anime, but that cast is fucking child’s play in comparison to the absolute rubbish that are the cast of characters from Toradora. I’ll go over the ones that stood out.

Taiga-A.K.A the worst Tsundere of all time. I’ve come to the conclusion recently that I don’t hate Tsundere’s as much as I thought I did. Mainly because Miss Senjougahara from the Monogatari franchise opened my eyes. Taiga isn’t Senjougahara however, as Taiga’s character traits are overexaggerated to the point where her character loses any and all sincerity that could have potentially been had for the character. The reason Senjo works is because Senjo is actually a deep character with things that stress her out, concern her, & things that bring her down. While Taiga does have these things, Toradora will bring these things onto the playing field, and then after all of it is said and done, they throw it away for a single unfunny gag revolving in Taiga either being short, hitting people, or being an annoying ass. Her character design is also hideous for reasons I’ve already mentioned, so she can’t even have the decency to have an appealing character design at the very least.

Ryugi-Ryugi is tolerable but he’s a blank-slate. He pretty much does nothing but go along with Taiga questioning nothing. There is something about him not liking how he likes his dad because if I recall his Father wasn’t a very good person & mistreated his mother. But Ryugi almost never seems affected by this at all, the only time I remember him being even remotely affected by this was in episode 1 when his mom accidentally brought it up, he got angry about it. Rugi’s character design is also incredibly basic, but at least it’s bearable to look at unlike Taiga’s. I do feel some level of sympathy for the poor guy, but that’s only because he has to live in Toradora’s world.

Minori-Minori the airhead……. and nothing else. Minori’s entire character is based off her being the happy-go-lucky character in a sea of more stressed (for lack of a better term) characters. The whole schtick is that she’s supposed to be a contrast, which could work, except her character trait is overexaggerated to a point where it becomes annoying above all else, the moments themselves follow Toradora’s random, loud nature to  how it writes comedy for its character, so that’s another aspect that adds to how annoying the series is. I also forgot to mention her voice is incredibly grating overtime as well, this voice actor must be shit, I wonder who it is. Wait a second, Horie Yui, the voice actress of Tsubasa Hanekwawa from Monogatari? NOOOOOOO, I really hope they paid you well to work on this abomination, you did not deserve to have your talents wasted on such an abhorrent series like this.

As for the rest of their characters, they aren’t as annoying as Minori and Taiga, but they’re pretty one note and have nothing going for them, and no, whatever character arc they may go through later on in the series isn’t going to change my mind on what I think about these characters, I can almost guarantee that their overexaggerated character traits would make the arcs lose any of their weight & sincerity that they may have anyway, nor do I think it will redeem any of them from how awful they were in the 5 episodes I was unfortunate enough to watch.

So that's my 3 reasons wh Toradora is my least favorite anime of all time. I did skimp some details like how the show is directed (which spoiler alert, isn’t good, it’s very flat overall), the story (which is ok, it’s a typical rom-com story but I don’t mind it), and the animation (which is as shitty as the art is). But I’m just fucking sick of it overall, I feel ashamed of myself for watching Toradora & wish I could erase it from my mind, it’s thus-far the only anime I regret watching, mainly because, I knew Toradora was gonna be shit from the first episode when I saw how they handled an opportunity to portray something like Ryugi being misunderstood as a bully, instead of doing something like turning it into a serious character moment that could develop Ryugi later on, they instead waste it on an overexaggerated, unfunny series of gags, fuck you Mari Okada. In conclusion, Toradora is my least favorite anime of all time, and I hope this review will at least get me to stop thinking about the series unless it gets brought up in conversation now that my thoughts are out there for the world to see in some capacity. The series gets, do I really need to say it? A 1, out of fucking, 10."

From the first or second episode when Taiga confesses and gets friend-zoned by Yuusaku it's a dead give away from her speech about Ryuji that she may have already fallen for him. I was disappointed about that because I felt that it was too early for that to be established. Additional moments that  made it predictable and a bit less enjoyable or less suspenseful for me was that after Ryuji's mother calls Taiga family, and lastly, more importantly is how they both go so far to support each others unrequited love.

Moving on from the story the artwork and most character designs are pretty good, especially for it's time. I think the only character's whose character designs I didn't care for was Ryuji. I'm not going to complain to much though because his character was supposed to be the delinquent type and the eyes, giving him such evil looking eyes and messy-ish hair work in that sense. Soundtrack... meh, only one good song that stood out for me and that was the track played when something sad or emotional was occurring. I'm a sucker for piano songs.

Characters were pretty amazing for the most part! I liked the relationships between the main and supporting characters, I felt like no characters were wasted. Even the background characters like Ryuji's friends. It was like every character had a purpose in the show and that's something I always like to see. Characters being put to good use even if they are people you don't really care about.

Toradora! was totally an enjoyable experience for me in some sense. I would recommend it to those who are more or less new to romance series. This is because as I mentioned earlier, it's really predictable and that easy predictability can really take away the enjoyment of the show.

Overall I have to give Toradora! 8/10 because while the story wasn't it's strong point the bond between the characters is something that makes it greater!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"Toradora is based off of some romantic comedy light novels written by Takemiya Yuyuko. From October '08 to March '09, an anime adaptation aired. It was brought to us by J.C. Staff, the same studio behind Shakugan no Shana, Yami no Matsuei & Hachimitsu to Clover. So, this could be terrible, really good or bland, based on that. The anime version's writer doesn't help narrow things down either. It was handled by Okada Mari. She's worked on such anime as Canaan & Kuroshitsuji II. So, let's take a  look and see if this is one of J.C's better works, or at least entertainingly bad
                  ...
like their work on Garzey no Tsubasa. 

Story:

Ryuuji  has romantic feelings for his classmate, Kushieda. Kushieda's best friend, Taiga, has a crush on Ryuuji's best friend, Kitamura. A fact that Ryuuji learns when she mistakenly leaves  love letter in his bag. Ryuuji and Taiga become friends, planning to help one another in order to make their romantic dreams come true. Next stop, shenanigans. 

The biggest flaw with the series is that its relatively unique set up for a rom-com becomes progressively more clichéd and predictable as the series progresses. In fact, a lot of you will be able to guess how the series ends just from applying romantic comedy logic to that short description. It's a shame because the early stuff can be fairly amusing. The series also has its share of always so “wonderful” jokes about a girl hitting a guy. Although, in all fairness, they aren't as prevalent in Toradora as they are in certain other series. The main romance is also quite bad with a convoluted love... heptagon... no, hexagon and with several overly melodramatic moments leading up to it.

Moving on to the positives. To reiterate, the early episodes are pretty entertaining and there are some genuinely funny moments in there with clever set ups and good pay offs. Seeing Ryuuji and Taiga try to help one another leads to quite a few good jokes. 

Characters:

The characters in this aren't particularly complex, but they're perfectly functional for a comedic series and most of the main cast get their share of good comedic moments. Where the series really excels is with the developing friendship between Ryuuji and Taiga early on. Although, the series sets about ruining it in the second half. 

Art:

The animation in this is pretty good. Granted, they don't have to do much with it since most of the series takes place in a rather generic townscape and at a rather generic school, but it has some strong details and the characters do look unique. The series also has some success at using lighting to set the mood at various points. It's a nice little detail. 

Sound:

They got some good actors for this series. Kugimiya Rie, Majima Junji, Horie Yui, Nojima Hirofumi & Kitamura Eri are all fine actors. I won't claim that Toradora shows any of them at their absolute best, but there's enough for them to work with that they can show their skills. The music is pretty mediocre. There's nothing that really sets it apart from the music of any other romantic comedy. 

Ho-yay:

There are points in the story where it definitely seems like Kushieda has feelings beyond friendship for Taiga. But as the series continues and becomes more trite, it becomes apparent that that isn't the case. 

Final Thoughts:

Toradora is a series with a strong start. In the beginning, it has a lot going for it. A legitimately different premise. Some strong comedic scenes. A good dynamic betwixt Ryuuji and Taiga. However, as the series progresses it gradually eliminates all of that. It tosses  it away to make things, to be completely frank, boring and generic. Instead of taking some risks, Takemiya decides to play it the safe, dull route we've seen in every romantic comedy ever made. As a result, the series squanders its early good will and ends things on a disappointing note. I sill wouldn't call it a bad series but I would say it ends up being as mediocre as Hachimitsu to Clover. My final rating is a 5/10. If you really like the standard rom-com clichés, you'll probably like it throughout. If you want something unique in any way you'll spend the first half of the series thinking “this could work if they don't decide to bog it down with obvious clichés” and the second half pressing your palm against your face a lot. Next week I'll look at Sword Art Online II."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Just from reading the synopsis and glancing over a few of the scores this anime received, I decided not to watch to it. One day I was in the mood for a romance and decided to check out Toradora! again, this time reading through several of the reviews. And, in all honesty, if I hadn't, I probably would have dropped the anime after the first few episodes. Yet, the promises that it would get a lot better by around episode six kept me watching. That, plus the fact that so many of the reviewers like it so much. It was also said to be similar
                  ...
to Lovely Complex, which it wasn't. At all. 

Story/Characters; 

It goes like this: Meet cute, crazy stuff, they work together and develop a sort of abusive friendship, then a lot, lot, lot of crazy stuff happens, not just with the two main characters, but also with the majority of the supporting characters. This anime makes sure to focus on everyone in the anime -- and nobody in class 2-C seems to have a boring life. 

A lot of people seemed to rate this anime lower than they would have liked to due to predictability. If that is something that turns you off, then in my opinion, you should totally watch this anime. It was one of the least predictable animes I have ever watched. Sure, you think you know what is going to happen (and what obviously is supposed to happen) at the start, but then everything goes haywire and you are left with several different options. And all of them have a very, very likely chance of being correct. Until the very end, each option is given enough supporting evidence to be proven a valid guess. I promise you, it is very unlikely that you will know what will happen next in this story. If anything, you will be dying to know or pissed off because all of your assumptions were incorrect. 

Now, I didn't like the story of this anime so much. Although it seemed obvious that they will be happiest together, I feel like Taiga and Ryuuji are an odd couple. Taiga is pretty abusive towards Ryuuji throughout the show, and a lot of the time I felt like he deserved better. They are both pretty selfish characters in their own way, as well. I never felt like they really belonged together. They seemed to be perfect best friends for each other, but no more than that. While watching the show, I really did get the sense of a father/daughter relationship between them, instead of two classmates and peers. That didn't really appeal to me.

Most romantic animes really let you see inside the characters' heads and into their hearts. This show doesn't do that. At the end, you will find that there is a lot that you didn't know about the characters -- things that could have completely changed your feelings about the show had they been introduced earlier. Instead of feeling like someone watching the lives of these characters play out before you, you almost just feel like an invisible person sitting in their classrooms and sometimes following the characters around. Like a stalker. Not a fan of the show, but a stalker. Although that does sound very nice, it does help you feel like you are a part of the characters' lives. You learn things just as slowly as any involved fellow classmate would. 

Now for a hardcore romance fan like myself, this story like may seem very tedious and hard to get through, for the romantic progression is very slow. It's there, but it is dragging along to the point where you may feel like skipping a few episodes in order to find out if the pace will ever speed up. I am here to tell you that it does. For about the last five or six episodes, it does. And what you get in those last episodes isn't really enough to endure for. For those who love humor, I didn't really feel like this show was great for that either. I didn't really find myself laughing a lot. Then again, that may just be because everything else is so consuming that I didn't really pay attention to any possible humor. 

Now, the characters in this show are pretty...amazing, to say the least. They all of have depth and each one could easily have at least a mediocre level anime set around them. Each character is very important to the show, as you will see if you watch it. They take up some screen time, but because of the time and effort put into their character development, that screen time is very enjoyable to watch. I was never frustrated when episodes focused on another character more often than Taiga and Ryuuji. Each character also has a nice air of mystery around them, which I feel added to the show's overall enjoyability.

While many people say that this is one of the best animes that they have ever watched, I disagree. Surely it is memorable because of how original it is and because of the ending, but not because I was blown away by it. The ending wasn't enough to make up for the other 20 or so episodes. 

Art/Sound; 

The art in Toradora! was pretty unique. It's memorable for being different, just like the rest of the show. The coloring is pretty arrogant, but very eye-catching. The action scenes are drawn very well, though. They were very good about keeping proportions throughout the show. Now, while things were accurate, all of the detail seemed to be focused on the eyes of the characters -- which were some of the best I have ever seen. Although at times the eyes just seemed to take over their entire face, I didn't find it to be too distracting. The facial expressions were amazing as well. You could really feel what the character's felt just by looking at their intense and masterfully drawn expressions. 

I did love the music for the anime, though. Both the EDs and the OPs were very nice. I believe that I will be listening to them for quite some time. I also really liked the fact that the voice actors sang the songs. It helped me really connect to the show. 

Conclusion;

I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, but I wouldn't tell them it would be a waste of their time to watch it if they felt like it. I don't feel like this anime held up to all the astounding reviews it had, but it also didn't hold up for all the weak points other reviewers suggested, in my mind. It is a very memorable show, but only because it is different and what you think will happen doesn't really happens -- this show really manages to shock you very frequently. This show is a lot more about friendship than it is about romance, in my opinion. 

Should I watch it?;

If you are in the mood for a dramatic romance, or a hysterical romantic comedy, that has a predictable plot line and focuses on the ups and downs of one relationship and lets you see into the hearts of the characters -- a show that talks about how high school life fits into a romance, one that has a nice shoujo art style and really helps you feel for the characters, I suggest you find something else. On the other hand, if you want to watch a nice coming-of-age story, one that deals with friendship a lot more than it does romance, one that focuses on the difficulties of finding and accepting yourself while still pleasing others, and is about finding those that mean a lot to you and filling a void in your life -- one that has a not-so-normal couple and a lot of love possibilities (and a lot of possibility in general), one that gives each character a lot of depth, mystery, and some adequate screen time, and one that makes you feel like a part of the story and is a pretty memorable tale, then this is for you."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"As we dash forward to chase our ideals, we may eventually realize that what we were chasing was beside us this whole time.

That is the basic premise that Toradora builds its story upon. Although Toradora is a rom com, the story line is not your typical rom com plot line. Our two main characters, Ryuji and Taiga, help each other get matched up with the other's friend. Furthermore, Taiga, for some reason, does not know how to take care of herself so it's up to Ryuji to make sure Taiga eats well and lives like a human. Obviously, it's inevitable that they will grow closer
                  ...
together. I enjoyed the fact that we don't have the main characters ""coincidentally"" encounter each other and develop feelings for one other that way. Instead, Toradora makes it so that we always see our couple together, scheming how they should get the guy/girl of their dreams.  
As you begin watching the show, you may realize that it's mainly funny moments with Taiga and Ryuji and that the romance is meh. But as you move into the second half of Toradora, the comedic elements begin to take second wheel and the romantic elements take center stage. I assure that it's a great feels trip. If you haven't been rooting for a character at this point, the story will convince you to root for someone. I definitely would say that the second half of Toradora is the best part of the entire anime and what makes it endearing for so long.

In Toradora, we have Ryuji as the male lead who is often mistaken to be a goon but in fact, deep down, he is a very caring guy (who is also a clean freak). Taiga is our main female lead. Aptly nicknamed ""Palmtop Tiger,"" she is someone who is not afraid to let her fists do the talking. For our ""secondary"" characters, we have Minori (Ryuji's crush), Kitamura (Taiga's crush), and Ami, a model who is an acquaintance of Kitamura. Although I label these three as ""secondary"" characters, they get ample screen time and a lot of development. This is another aspect that Toradora does well. The writers did not abandon them. Rather, Minori, Kitamura, and Ami are essential characters to the story but they don't take away our desire to see the developing chemistry between Taiga and Ryuji.
The only troubling aspect of Toradora is that at times, I found myself extremely frustrated because the characters can't either express themselves or seem oblivious to the feelings of others. Indeed, these are things that happen in real relationships, which makes Toradora very relatable, but since the anime is a rom com, this element doesn't mesh well with the genre.

The sound was fairly good. There were a few emotional scenes where the music helped bring out my emotions but other than that, the background music was alright. However, it was not intrusive in any way and was well-composed for the situation. The voice actors brought out the unique characteristics of each character and did a wonderful job. 
I didn't quite like the opening and ending themes to Toradora. Although the beat of the first opening is pretty cool, I found the opening did not match the atmosphere of Toradora. 

The artwork was good. There were some scenes where the colours were very rich and captured the mood really well. In general, Toradora leans on a vibrant colour palette. I felt that the character designs were a little simple. For example, Ami isn't drawn like a model as she should be so without telling you she's a model, you will think of her as just another student.

Although I don't think Toradora lived up to its hype, I enjoyed the anime. Since Taiga is the Queen of Tsunderes, you should have Toradora on your anime list (otherwise, she may come at night and hit you with her wooden katana). Even if you aren't a big Tsundere fan but still enjoy rom coms, you  should have Toradora on your list because it is a very memorable anime. 

I definitely would tell you to check out Toradora! Let me know what you liked or disliked about this anime. Was it over-hyped? Was the ending spot on? I would love to hear from you!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"“If you trip while running down a hallway, you’ll get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you’ll cry.  
Minori Kushieda Toradora.

Toradora is a special anime for me. It was not of the two anime that introduced me to the rom-com genre back in 2012 the other one being Clannad but it was the first romcom anime that I ever loved. I loved it so much that when I eventually started to buy animes DVDs back in 2015 Toradora was the third anime I purchased. From that point on I re-watched Toradora least 2 to 3 times per year and I still love it
                  ...
even if it had some flaws that I started to notice on my last re-watch of it. Now unlike Clannad where my opinion of that show worst as years went on to a point, I haven’t touched my Season 1 and After Story DVD sets for almost a year thanks to me having a low value of the series due to it serious killing flaws. My opinion on Toradora has stayed positive to this day despite its minor flaws I still think Toradora is the best modern romcom anime to ever come out.
So what made Toradora so special.
Why do I still love this show to this day?
Well let's find out, shall we?

The story follows Ryuji Takasu who is getting ready for his second year at high school. Despite being an overall nice guy he has a mistaking reputation for looking like a delinquent thanks to he evil looking eyes as well as his facial structure looking like a young yakuza member rather than a high school student. His best friend Yuusaku as well his crush Minori (whom he is too bashful to approach) are the only two people who actually don’t mind his evil looking eye appearance. Soon by complete accident, he bumps into a main female lead and tsundere Taiga Aisaka aka the Palmtop Tiger.

After an accidental first encounter that ends with Taiga KO-ing him in the face, Ryuuji finds out at the end of the school day that Taiga has put a love letter to Kitamura (whom she has a crush on but is too bashful to approach) in his bag by accident. This leads to Taiga breaking into his house that night to retrieve the letter by killing him with a bamboo sword only to discover that she forgot to put the letter in the envelope and has inadvertently outed her crush on Kitamura to Ryuuji.
After much ado and a few sword-blows, Ryuuji and Taiga strike a tenuous deal to use their positions as The Best Friends to help each other bag their respective crushes.

Now the story of Toradora may be very simple in nature but the execution is downright amazing.
Right out the bat, the show makes a great first impression as the first episode does a wonderful job at establishing the setting, tone, characters, and themes of the show. The show also knows what it wants as it says true to its roots as a slice of life, drama romcom series without being something that is not.
The show does a brilliant job of exploring the themes and topics of running away, true love, being your true self, breaking your shell and it does them all great.
The show also does a great job at keeping the audience with all the story events that happen in the show by having great writing and for the most part great overall pacing.

The characters in Toradora are all fantastic.
Ryuji is a great male lead. He may appear as this generic delinquent who hates everyone with that Yakuza look but he’s actually a nice and friendly guy who care for others. He also an obsessive neat freak where he doesn’t like messy houses and he would go out of his way to clean everything that he can. The best example of this was when Ryuji enters Taiga house for the first time. Despite Ryuiji having great personality traits he’s is a well-developed character who has great character chemistry with the cast especially Taiga.

Taiga despite being the queen of tsundere is actually a pretty great character. From start to finish I liked her character development as her interactions towards the rest of the cast. She may appear as this Lousie and Shana but unlike Lousie and at times Shana where they are tsundere for the sake for it Taiga’s tsundere behaviour rarely mirror her true feelings.
She may not be for everyone but if you can pass her tsundere side you will start to see how humanly flawed Taiga is as a person.

If I had to pick my favourite character in Toradora it would be Minori. 
She is a sweet and upbeat person who loves to keep everybody happy but there’s a lot than that. In order for her to cope with own internal struggles and loneliness, she plays softball as well as working on a series of part-time jobs. Her character development in the series was great and I really loved every scene that she’s was in. Overall brilliant character.

Now we have Kitamura Taiga crush and Ryuji best friend. Not gonna lie I thought I Kitamaru was pretty bland in the beginning as he just came as this typical smart guy chararters. Thankfully he does become a much better character as the series as he had a great character arc that was well told and it had a satisfying conclusion.

Finally, we have Ami who is a childhood friend of Kitamura who before transferring schools, she was a fashion designer. 
She may start off as this typical fan-service character but there is much more to her. In school, she plays a facade where she behaves as this cute and ditzy girl but she’s actually a mean and spoiled bitch. I honestly really loved this character. She’s probably my second favourite character in the show only losing to Minori. She is just is a joy to watch every-time she was on screen especially in the end of her character arc where she confronts the guy who takes pictures of her by smashing his camera while giving that devious look to him.

The side characters are good for what they were but apart from Yuri and Sumire the side characters are not as memorable as the mains.

I could go on and on how great this anime is sadly I have to talk about the show’s flaws because there are only two of them.

For starters, I didn’t like the portrayal of Ryuji mom where she doesn’t really behave an adult figure where instead of being a prideful or strick mother she often behaves like a kid who lazy and constantly have parties while the child always picks up all the things for them. Am not saying that Adults cannot have any fun whatsoever because I believe that all adults should have fun when are not working but Ryuji mother doesn’t feel like a responsible mother at all. As much I liked how Ryuji mother aspects Taiga as a family member she doesn’t really set any rules or do anything that a mother should do.

The second and final minor flaw is its predictable nature. Personally, I don’t mind if a show is predictable in nature because as long if it’s written well I can completely ignore its predictable nature and thankfully Toradora, for the most part, is a great ride that I enjoyed even it’s predictable. However if you a person who is not a fan of predictable stories than this show will most likely won’t like this show especially when certain scenes in Toradora actually highlight the end of the show before you even get there.

Other than the two minor flaws which I just mentioned the story and characters in Toradora was amazing.

J.C Staff is known to have great art in the shows that the make and Toradora is no different.
The background scenery is very appealing to look at thanks to smooth soft colour pallet. The charterers for both the main and supporting were aagreat looking.
As for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good and well handled. Sure the beginning the animation is basic stuff but when we get to the actual action and emotional scenes of the series the animation really shines. The best examples of this were Taiga vs Sumire fight in episode 16 to Taiga emotional breakdown in episode 19.
Fantastic job J.C Staff

The soundtrack for Toradora is fantastic and nicely composed. I know not many people were a not fan of the soundtrack and I can understand they are coming from but I thought the soundtrack for Toradora was well made as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of Toradora perfectly. One of the song track Lost my Pieces from Toradora is not only my favourite track from Toradora but it’s also my second favourite track piece from a romance only losing to Always be With You from Kodocha.

Some of my other favourite tracks include Startup, Magic of Love, Morning Glory, Happy Monday and Ready Steady Go. They are just brilliant tracks overall.

All the opening and endings themes in Toradora are great in their own ways and they are extremely catchy.

Now for sub vs dub.
I only saw the sub twice back in 2012 but I remember it being great filled with talented Seiyuus. However, as soon as I put in DVD disc one for Toradora as well watching the first couple of episodes dubbed I immediately decided to never touch the sub again. Don’t get me wrong the sub is great but the dub was a special case of awesomeness. Out of all the romcom anime that I have seen Toradora has the best English dub that I have seen from a romcom anime. I was blown away by how awesome the dub was as every single voice actor and I mean every single one did a fantastic job voicing their respective characters. The one thing that the Toradora dub had over the sub is how realistic the acting was. Just a well-made and directed dub overall.

Toradora is a perfect example of a modern romcom anime done right. The story is well written, theme exploration is masterful, the characters are wonderful in their own ways, the visuals were nice, the soundtrack was great and the English dub was perfect.

Toradora is not only the best modern romcom anime to ever come out it’s but it’s also my third favourite romcom anime period. The show may not be for everyone but for those who adored the series such we can get past its predictable nature and flaws we see a show that is beautiful and heartwarming.
If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that has great characters and amazing themes exploration then I recommend Toradora.
It is a anime that will forerver stay in my elite four of romcom anime."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,RecommendedSpoiler,"Toradora is one of the first animes that left me questioning whether I enjoyed the ride or not... In my opinion, I feel like the progression of the story and the way the characters are conflict in so many ways.

Starting in order of importance:

Story - It was very spot-on and unique. A story about a boy meeting a girl for the purpose of giving each other relationship advice is not the conventional anime. It does not go direct with the romance. Rather, it takes its time to establish the characters and their relations amongst each other. The pacing of the story was also great, each
                  ...
episode you learn something new. However, the reason I gave it an 8 was the ending. One thing I REALLY hate about this anime is how whenever a character talks to the main character of how they truly feel, the main character ends up not listening and the whole conversation just drops like a rock. This recurrent element made it difficult for me to get to know the characters. They, most of the time, introduce their problems and almost never finish off with how it ties to the story, The ending was 

(SPOILER ALERT) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
also super rushed and it felt as if all their efforts from the very beginning had gone to waste. The ending was a big middle finger to all of the other characters within the last few episodes. They get cast out and the unfinished links with the main character remain unlinked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character - The characters are very realistic. Every character puts on a mask in their own way. There is a large barrier between how the characters act and how they truly feel. 
One big complaint I have, however, is that each character is frustrating to the plot in its own way. There are random potential scenes that could lead to something moving the plot, but in the end you learn almost nothing of the characters from that scene. The only time we get to truly know the characters is AFTER you go through all the frustration of the progression of the story.

Art - The art makes this anime. Each character is distinct in their own way and the colors they use is awesome.

Sound - It moves with the story well, especially the opening. Very beautiful and well-timed.

Enjoyment - The comedic scenes were really enjoyable and some really dramatic scenes hit me hard. Although this anime failed to meet a resolution, it does make unforgettable climaxes that occur amongst each character. In short, when shit gets down, it GETS DOWN. 

TOO LONG DIDN'T READ?:

Story is realistic and complex. However, when you think something important to the story is going to happen, it won't happen. Each character is lovable and different in their own way. Art and Sound is beautiful. Very enjoyable, you will get hooked. When shit gets down, IT GETS DOWN."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"Looking to expand my occasionally action or intellectually centered anime tastes, I perused the top rated anime list in the hopes of sparking interest for something a little different. Toradora has been recommended to me a number of times over the years, but I've always been hesitant or too busy to give it a try. Perhaps it's the inconsistencies I have with the romantic comedies genre. Shows like Nodame Cantabile have left significant impressions on me, while others have been mediocre or laughable at best. Believable love stories can be difficult to convey as a narrative, especially when you start to add petty high school
                  ...
drama and love triangles into the mix. Finish everything off with an emotional punching bag mc and exasperating tsundere and you've got the potential for failure. It took me over two months to finish Toradora for good reason. I took small breaks from it, tried to put it on hold and even considered dropping it entirely, but through sheer willpower I have reached its conclusion and wish to share why Toradora just doesn't work as a romantic anime.

I'll cut right to the chase. From its opening scene, you can tell Toradora is not trying to be your stereotypical slice of life anime. The dialogue is witty and the comedy is crass and rapidfire. Ryuji initially seemed like a refreshing protagonist in both appearance and attitude. Given his parental background, his desire to be self-sufficient is understandable. This perception quickly deteriorates as more of the characters and setting are introduced, and the infamous tsundere, Aisaka or ""Taiga"" steals the show. Now if there's one thing I've learned, it's that girls and guys have a limited number of situations in which it's believable for them to be friends. Maybe they were in diapers together or what have you but most of the time it doesn't work out without someone getting hurt or having feelings for each other. Knowing this fact you can pretty much sum up the entire plot of Toradora within the first two episodes. They're eventually going to end up together. Ryuchi and Taiga are both in love with each other's best friends, so naturally they miserably attempt to help each other pursue the affections of the other party. Every attempt to get the prospective couples alone goes awry, a great bit of foreshadowing on the writer's behalf. It sounds like a simple love story, and it really should've been. Except the countless awkward conversations and feeble advances our main characters had with their respective love interests help to cement the fact they don't deserve to be in love at their age. The ensuing 25 episodes consist of these awkward exchanges and the melodrama is so thick you could cut it with a knife. Most every interaction is misunderstood or blown out of proportion, and literally everything becomes an emotional crisis with these characters. All the while Ryuji is incessantly berated with physical and emotional abuse from Taiga. But it's OK, that just means she loves him... or something like that.

Forgive my philosophical ramblings, but I've learned through the years and relationships I've had that you can't choose who you want to fall in love with. Love just happens. It can be crude and fickle, but at the end of the day it can give you a feeling unlike anything you've felt before. This is why I don't question the validity of odd couple romances (Ore Monogatari/Nodame Cantabile etc.) throughout entertainment. Sometimes characters are polar opposites in personality and looks but something subconscious draws them together. This is what Toradora tries to accomplish. However, a relationship constructed in this manner must be done with finesse, while not being overshadowed by such melodrama as this series has. Similarly growing up in a house without a father as I have, the furthest idea from my mind would be to take care of someone with so much baggage. Taiga takes advantage of the doormat Ryuji is and carries herself in the most bombastic way possible. Ryuji is most certainly a glutton for punishment. Even if I would've enjoyed the romance elements I don't know if I could've stomached the abortion of an ending Toradora had. Many anime fail at getting love right, and this series ends up no different. All it takes is for someone to have an overly emo moment and the entire conclusion gets blown to smithereens. As the final credits were about to roll, the same tsundere stigma that was starting to fade away was slammed back into my face, taking a big shit on my hopes and expectations for the show. Those who have seen the series know exactly what I'm talking about, One of the worst endings I have seen in quite some time, a romance cop out.

Toradora's writing was frustratingly inconsistent. Character's dialogue and emotions would swap from operatic to deeply intellectual within seconds, leaving me dumbfounded as a viewer. All five main characters put on some sort of a façade with their personality, driving the story into many arguments and miscommunications. That was an aspect that I enjoyed to some extent, as I believe most everyone acts a little differently in groups of people than in a one on one interaction. The pacing is well constructed, and the series ends up being split into three major parts. The first half of the series is used mostly to set up the relationships for the five characters, but unfortunately ended up being quite boring as a result. Around episode 14 things really begin to pick up, with conflicts coming to a head as the main characters start running out of time to profess their love appropriately. Everything is assimilated effectively but falls flat due to a train wreck ending. I feel like most people who consider the ending good are only fooling themselves with false reassurance for investing so much time in the series only to be greatly disappointed. I understand that I'm probably not the target audience for this anime, but just because you're portraying a high school romantic comedy doesn't mean you have to sensationalize each line of dialogue or character's emotions. We all went to high school, but I never felt like everyone was that annoying... at least not all the time.

Although there were numerous moments of immaturity, Toradora created a setting that made me quite reminiscent of my time in high school. Embarking on school trips, creating chances to talk to that one girl you liked since grade school, or waiting for that same opportunity during a school dance or function. Although I'm frustrated by it now, hindsight is 20/20 and I could probably imagine myself being slightly timid or awkward when it came to confession time... perhaps just not on the same level as the writer portrayed here. I also love the scene with Ryuji and Minori when they were at Ami's beachhouse at night. The way they were talking about love without coming out and blatantly saying the word kind of made me laugh, and help me put back into perspective what I was watching, and how young the characters really were.

I found it irritating when the writers tried to pass off Ryuji's slanted eyes as the reason everyone thought he was rough around the edges. I know I've judged books by their covers before, but this one is just silly... not to mention the fact that most, if not all of these characters are Asian, which kind of throws that reasoning out the window. As I said before, I related to Ryuji based on personal experiences, and I was initially hoping he'd be a character I could identify with. His germaphobic nature and desire to be the patriarchal figure in his household was right on point, but I didn't buy into his relationship with Taiga one bit. The tsundere trope has always felt unnecessary to me. Even yanderes like Senjougahara from the Monogatari series has some believability, because I've encountered some crazy chicks in my lifetime... And sometimes it makes them even hotter. But it just isn't working in Taiga's case. I can give positive remarks to the amount of depth she had as a character though... and the relationship with her parents was certainly believable. I guess you never realize how pampered some kids can be until they start trying to live on their own (Taiga=primordial millennial). I just don't understand everyone's general praise for Taiga as a character, he'll she's not even the most enjoyable character from the series, let alone all of anime.

Minori actually had some depth as a character. She put on such a ditzy and carefree attitude, but in all actuality she was just as perceptive as anyone else in the series, especially when it came to Ryuji. It was refreshing to see a character playing an ""out of reach"" love interest that was everything but one-dimensional. That scene when she approached Ryuji while he was in the bear suit was kind of heartbreaking. By that point you knew the feelings she had for him were mutual, and how covered up she got them to be for Taiga's sake. Kitamura is a turd. High school taught me how vain and superficial girls can be, and if I learned anything from that, it's that no girls are attracted to the guy with glasses. Not to mention he was a complete dweeb, with spastic mannerisms that often made no sense and a complete lack of composure when he finds out his crush doesn't like him. Grow up dude, you're barely old enough to drive! It's like he almost went completely nihilistic after he bleached his hair. I kind of kept wondering how Ryuji even became friends with him, they're really nothing alike. Ami is the only character in Toradora that I actually liked to be honest. It seems that her history and modeling has actually injected a sense of maturity into her mind that the other characters just don't have. While the rest of the cast is laden with melodrama, Ami seems to come out of left field with a comment I'd expect to see in real life. Although I don't understand what she saw in Ryuji, I would've preferred if they would've ended up together vice the way that it turned out. I can only imagine how she struggled to take her friends seriously.

The music in Toradora is so-so. It didn't necessarily add or subtract much from the series... But there wasn't much variety in the use of background music. I really enjoyed the first OP and ED, but the 2nd OP really didn't flow well with the rest of the show for me... And those lyrics are ghastly. I will give props to the voice acting in Toradora, as most all of the characters were played fantastically and were very distinguishable. Most notably was Rie Kugimiya as Taiga. Her voice absolutely nailed Taiga's seething personality and tsunderisms to a tee. Yui Horie also dos a fine job as the spacey Minori. The art and animation is okay, considering the anime came out over 7 years ago I'd say it aged quite well.  As I mentioned above I was pleased by the stark differences between the five main characters, in character models especially. Some older anime have trouble differentiating the characters due to lackluster illustrators, but Toradora does not fall into that trap.

Overall, I was quite disappointed with this series. It just didn't capture the natural, unadulterated love that so many romance stories have. It even got boring with its unneeded drama and emotion-stricken scenes, leaving me to take the characters less seriously. People say that Toradora is the pinnacle of the romantic comedy genre, and if that's the case I may not be returning to it for quite some time.  I can't say I enjoyed it all that much. I'd recommend Toradora to fans of romance anime since that's the target audience, or someone who enjoys the tsundere trope... it just wasn't necessarily for me.

Taiga starts out as one of the most obnoxious schoolgirls you'll ever meet. and Ryuuji is one of those misunderstood guys that can't seem to catch a break from his classmates. but the repartee between him and Taiga is priceless.  The artwork could be a little sharper, but this is J.C. Staff, so i'll cut them a little slack. and the ED is a little bit of an earworm. but hey, i like a good song that sticks in yr. earhole.
and the
                  ...
supporting cast so far is very funny, espec. Minorin. she'd be a a good blonde.
Overall, this is one of the funnier shows i've seen this fall."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"First of all, if you're into Romantic Genres, you'll LOVE this, if you like School Life Themes, you'll LOVE THIS, in fact if you like anything you'll LOVE TORADORA!(Contains heavy Spoilers, not reccomended to read if you haven't watched it)

ToraDora has a very interesting story, probably the reason why I keep on watching it, I love it. Taiga loves Kitamura(which is Ryuuji's Friend) while Ryuuji loves Minorin(Taiga's friend) sound simple? as if, Both Taiga and Ryuuji really doesn't feel comfortable talking to the people they like so they decide to both help each other. That's the story in a nutshell, but what makes the story
                  ...
so epic is how they develop their feelings for each other. The story is indeed a bit cliche however, how they develop it is interesting. The fact that they go from accomplice to lovers is what I found very outstanding. They go through life not noticing that the person they love is actually just right beside them. Indeed a very Interesting Story. I have got to say that the ending is also very fitting and I liked it very much!

I got nothing more to say to the art apart from it's decent, I liked the way they drew everyone, it's brilliant and I couldn't wish for anything more. Although to be honest with you, Ryuuji doesn't look THAT scary =), other than that, it's good.

Sound, probably the only thing I don't like about ToraDora, I don't hate it, it's just not my cup of tea. However, even if I didn't like the sound, it is very fitting, the cute atmosphere that the opening gives is good.

Characters, Aside from the storyline the characters plays a vital point in the story itself, if it wasn't for the characters it wouldn't be such a good anime. 

Ryuuji is what you would call scary, yet very admirable inside, he's easily misunderstood because of his appearance. Looks can be deceiving. He is caring and helped taiga ""survive"" everyday life by giving her comfort and food. He also want to make Taiga very happy, which is probably the reason why I liked this character. She helps her with her communication difficulties and even helped her make decisions that she would probably never done herself. She Likes Minorin, and tries very hard, however he is too shy to express his feelings.

Taiga is what you would call Tsundere - I.E. a violent human outside yet in the inside is a caring girl. She is very interesting in the fact that she can't seem to do anything right! she needs ryuuji(and was shown through the last few episodes of the anime itself) to live life. She Likes Kitamura to the point where she can barely talk to him. She also has a very special relationship with Ryuuji, the fact that he takes care of her is a special bond between Taiga and Ryuuji. She wants Ryuuji to be Happy by confessing to Minoring, however she regrets that because deep inside she likes Ryuuji, she cries and regrets. She actually Loves Ryuuji and in fact looking back at it now she loved Ryuuji from the start.

Kitamura, is also yet another interesting character, he doesn't dislike Taiga and in fact he got rejected by Taiga before. He likes the Student Council president very much that he'd actually die for her. He is very caring and doesn't want to hurt anybody. But he'd do anything for his Love, to the extreme point.

Minorin, is probably my favourite character, she is sweet, air headed but very cunning, she knows taiga the most in the series and that fact is vital to the ending of the story itself. She blows off fear by being very lively, that's one of the reason why Ryuuji liked her. She doesn't like anyone though she reveals that she liked Ryuuji in the end however she thinks that Taiga is what best for Ryuuji, she sacrificed her love for her friend, I really loved Minorin.

Ami, is a very dark and distinct character that works behind the scenes most of the time. She is afraid to show her true colours as she wants people to believe that she's actually evil inside, she has show her true colours on the main characters. She goes through her life as a model, she has a stalker, but she couldn't find the courage to stand up for herself, instead Ryuuji helped her to face her fear. She, only hinted, loves Ryuuji because of the fact that Ryuuji would like her for what she is and not for what she isn't. She is indeed an interesting character.

The Enjoyment of the show is 100% 100/10. I love it, in fact it took me less than 24 hours to actually watch the whole show, that's how much I love it. The Comedy and the Romance scene are very well put, if I was a bit more emotional I'd have cried through the series. Cry laughing and Cry sad. I would've also cried on how I wanted so much more of ToraDora, but that's how it is.

Overall a very outstanding anime. Reccomended!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"*sigh*

You know, I’m starting to lose all hope when it comes to romance / slice of life anime as they tend to either go in a certain way: they try to be outrageously funny and/or dramatic but it ends up being only one or the other and I’m left cold feeling that have doing nothing remarkable or distinctive to make me care about the characters, what they go through and the story as a whole and if you wondered what title made me like this, let’s say that I’m all out of LOVE for this genre. But, then, there’s Toradora and I have heard mixed
                  ...
things about the series (few either good than bad) but I don’t have the biggest expectations for the show.

Despite Ryuji Takasu’s gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent. Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda’s best friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers.

Now, as first it may seem like this is going to be some typical love story where the main guy tries to get with this girl by the help of the girl’s said friend and that said friend wants to hook up with the main guy’s best friend and then it turns out that those two might fall in love with each other. BUT…..it actually ends up being more than that. The show illustrates that love is a complicated thing and if something comes crumbling down, no one is going to be left unscathed emotionally, no matter how well you try to hide it. Originally, I was drawn by the comedic aspects of the show as I did had myself a great laugh throughout the earlier episodes but once it gets into the dramatic episodes later on, I was hooked and invested in knowing how the characters will progress throughout. One aspect of the show never overshadowed the other as both the comedy and drama are rightfully balanced without a hint of overexerted awkwardness in the writing.

I really appreciated how the characters in the show remain to be interesting and likable despite being some clichéd character-types at first but they are portrayed as realistic characters and the show equally get in-depth with them as the show goes on. At first, I thought Taiga was just going that annoying tsundere type that I loathe in anime so much, but eventually, she turns out to be an endearing character and reasons why she is what she is (i.e. coming from a broken home, parents don’t give a damn) and how she does stand up for her friends various times and is straight to the point honest. Ryuuji is somebody that isn’t a spineless male lead nor an off-the-wall perverted idiot lead, but a level-headed genuine character that doesn’t come off as Gary Stu-ish or manufactured as he does have his inner struggles to challenge through. Yusaku, to me, can be often funny and OK but he wasn’t really that important of a character to me to get fully invested but he does have a moment in that in the latter half of the series. But the ones to get me fully invested are Minori and Ami. For Minori, she does seems like the energetic best friend character with a nice girl personality that I really did like at first but she really progresses from that as she show signs of her not confronting her true feelings that she seems like a coward even though she does care for her friends. Ami on the other hand, I never would have expect to like someone as her being a bitch-in-sheep’s clothing character but honestly she wants more in friends than just having followers and admirers and while often she does pick on Taiga, she does care if anything were to happen to her.


J.C. Staff animated this production and it was a great effort from their part. However, this is nothing I would call new but more of the standard fare I expect from them as the artwork is gorgeous and the movement is performed smoothly and fluid within the context of the show. Character designs are also much to the standard of many anime characters but it is nothing over-the-top or fan service related but manageable.

For the music portion, “Pre-Parade”, the 1st opening theme performed by the main three female leads (Rie Kugimiya, Yui Horie, and Eri Kitamura) does set the mood for the series’ first half and I got to say, this is a decent track with some small flaws in it like it does sound like it’s over-produced in some areas but I actually like the track enough to not skip it. The 2nd opening theme, “silky heart”, also appropriately set the tone during the latter half of the series remarkably acceptable. The rest of the music delivers the dramatic moments spot-on as did the ending themes, “Vanilla Salt” and “Orange”, which sounds like ingredients for a cake than a song.

Now when I say this show was a surprise to me being good, there is also another surprise.


THIS SHOW ACTUALLY HAS AN ENGLISH DUB!!!!


No, really. This show is licensed by NIS America and normally they do sub-only anime releases and this is their first English dub release and also with the dub being done by Bang Zoom Entertainment and with director Alex Von David on the helm. I’m also proud to say that this is a damn good—no, a damn great dub!! Mainly, it’s because BZ is doing a slice-of-life show for once since recently they have only been dubbing action anime titles for some time and I think the dub shows off the VA’s acting range a bit more. Erik Scott Kimerer and Cassandra Lee Morris give out great performances as Ryuuji and Taiga. Johnny Yong Bosch was rather fine as Yusaka, usually the standard from him but he did his part exceptionally. Personally I think the standouts goes to both Christine Marie Cabanos as Minori and Erika Harlacher as Ami. Cabanos unquestionably delivers more to her acting range as Minori during the dramatic moments as well as her comedic scenes. Most of her comedic scenes did felt like a preview of what to see her as Mako in Kill La Kill (which I’m dying to see in the English dub, BTW). Harlacher sounds very natural as Ami, maintaining both the bitchiness and reasonableness in the character without feeling too overbearing or over the top and this is practically the actress’ best role yet.

FINAL VERDICT: Toradora is a complete surprise from me. Here I was expecting to be some run of the mill cliché romance anime but I got something more from this. Everything from the characters, the basic storyline and the soundtrack was executed well despite being plain on paper. Has this made me look at slice of life romantic anime in a different light? Maybe. This show gave me hope for this genre of anime and I hope future titles can learn from this show and how to make me care for the story, the characters and how they’re able to manage that. Toradora, you are definitely a title that I recommend to people. I should’ve never doubted you."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Toradora! is one of those animes that immediately pop into my mind when someone asks me for a rom/com recommendation. It's simply a must-watch if you're a fan of rom/com. Even if you aren't a typical watcher of these kinds of shows, Toradora! is definitely a great first step into that world. 

STORY:
Toradora! follows a typical plot: a guy named Takasu Ryuuji has a crush on a girl, who just happens to be his neighbor's best friend. Coincidentally, the neighbor, Aisaka Taiga, has a crush on Takasu's best friend, Yuusaka Kitamura. The two team up and try to help each other get their targets through
                  ...
their adventures. But as the story introduces more characters and progresses from its light-hearted comedy to its heavy drama, the story evolves from its cliche'd plot and takes on a much deeper story. And while many animes are able to conduct such a transition, Toradora! is one that is able to do so subtly and beautifully. 
10/10.

ART:
I'm not particularly picky about the art for animes, and to be completely honest, there's nothing special about the art for Toradora!. But it's definitely visually appealing and is well done. The only issue I had was he striking similarity between Kawashima Ami and the Student Countil President. The two were so similar I constantly confused one for the other when they were both introduced. Other than that, I thought the art was great. 
9/10.

SOUND:
When an anime has a great OP, I never skip it for each episode. Unfortunately, that didn't happen with Toradora!. While the first OP was quite catchy when I first heard it, it soon became something I just skipped to get to the show. Generally, the music was nothing special, especially during the light-hearted scenes. But the more touching moments of the anime had wonderful music that practically drove me to tears. Many dramatic scenes with crying characters or fights sent shivers done my spine as my vision started to blur in front of the screen. Such music was simply nicely fit into such moments and I couldn't describe it any other way. 
10/10.

CHARACTER:
The characters at first appear to be two dimensional. But they have a lot more to them later when the story really hits the dramatic point. At that point, a lot of the characters' different sides and hidden desires are revealed and each changing angle is so interesting. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the story, so unfortunately I cannot substantiate my view. The characters are all lovable with their quirks and moments, especially Aisaka Taiga. She was by far my favorite character throughout the whole anime. 
9/10.

ENJOYMENT:
With the unique execution and traversal of such an cliche'd story, I was well caught off-guard with such a emotional ride. The music and the story just blended together to create something that was truly amazing. I cried plenty and was hungry for more after I finished the series. It got so bad that afterwards, I went into a state of depression because I couldn't find anything like Toradora! 
Toradora! definitely remains as one of the animes at the top of my list."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"Alright, let's get this over with.

I am going to preface this ""review"" (probably little more than a trite rant because I can't review worth a damn) by saying that I'm sure you have your reasons for liking Toradora, you know, that's totally fine. I'm not the be all and end all.

But to be blunt, I don't just dislike this show. I despise it and everything it stands for.

Let's see: Toradora is supposed to be a rom-com-drom, right? So, how does each category stand?

1. Romance
The romance is bad. Plain and simple. The connections between Taiga and Ryuuji are barely prevalent throughout the course of the show,
                  ...
barring like maybe the last few episodes, and even then it didn't give me any kind of emotions at all.

There's rushing your romance, and then there's dragging on for so long you almost forget who's supposed to be with who.

But hey, I could be interpreting it wrong.

2. Comedy
Comedy is subjective, right? Well, in my subjective opinion, this show is dull as fuck when it comes to comedy. Not much to elaborate on here, besides the fact I don't find this show funny.

3. Drama
Well, with the dull romance and comedy, we're left with drama.

And well, this show does have drama. Melodrama. And this is where my true hatred for this show comes into play.

I'm not kidding when I say the characters COMPLETELY overreact over the smallest fucking things in this show. 

For instance, your crush gets rejected by his own crush?
Go fucking MURDER her with a wooden sword! Because that's not over reacting!

Your father sometimes neglects you?
FUCKING DESTROY his testicles when you finally see him!

You didn't give someone a box of chocolates?
Well, overreact over that too, because we don't have enough melodrama in this show!

The last example isn't a joke by the way. That's literally one of the scenes.

Honestly, this show tries to be dramatic just for the purpose of shoehorning in drama. It's almost obnoxious to be honest.

And to go over the characters briefly:

Ryuuji is forgettable.

Taiga is the worst tsundere ever.

Kitamura is forgettable.

Ami exists solely to spew meaningless meaningful words.

And Minori is bi, apparently.

If it wasn't obvious enough, I don't care about anyone in this show.
________________________________________________________
Overall, it's very likely I'm interpreting all of the messages that Toradora gives wrong, and for that reason, I suppose I can see why people actually go as far to say that this is their favourite show.

But according to my interpretation, Toradora is nothing more than a painfully unfunny, melodramatic failure of a romance.

At least the music and animation is good.

Kudos to whoever actually read my god-awful ""review""."

                                      (13/25 eps)","Story: Not much to say for a storyline in Toradora, it seems pretty much to be a series of conflicts, one following the other. However, I'm not saying that the conflicts aren't interesting, but for people who like one strong storyline, this series is not for you.

Art: One of the strong points of Toradora. The artwork I must say, sorry IamJoe, is &quot;fabulous&quot; ^^. The artwork is fluid and clean. The pictures have strong colors that catch the eye, and keep your attention. Shading, light, etc, are all well composed throughout the anime. Each scene, disregarding events, are highly detailed, and only compliments and enhcances
                  ...
the anime.

Sound: The music in the OP and ED, though not my style, succeed in conveying the events in the anime, which is actually quite rare in anime. In addition to actually matching the story, the music is catchy. I often find myself in school or at home bored, and before realizing it, I am singing &quot;Banira, salturade, banira.&quot; Quite embarrassing when everybody in class turns around and stares at me. &lt;&lt;
But yeah, good music.

Characters: Another strong point in Toradora, the characters all have strong personalities, and are generably likable. The characters go through life changing events that do change them forever, giving the anime a sense of realism. The characters all have unique designs that support their personalities, and make the series that much better.

Enjoyment: Toradora is mostly enjoyable. Now, notice I say &quot;mostly&quot;. There are a considerable number of dull points that made me want to stop watching the series, for me, mostly in the beginning. However, if you give the anime a chance, after a few episodes, the anime will grow on you, and you will come to like it.

Overall: Good"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"When it comes to watching anime, I really consider myself more of a marathon runner than a sprinter.  Usually I like to take my time and watch a couple of shows simultaneously, so 24 episode series usually take me like 3 or 4 months to finish.  Therefore it’s something of a testament to how much I liked Toradora! that I wound up finishing it in a mere 12 days.

Admittedly after watching the first episode I wasn’t overly impressed with the prospects for Toradora!  It seemed like it would be a show with a slightly unique take on the rom-com if nothing else
                  ...
and be pretty good.  And the first few episodes in the series were very funny and enjoyable but didn’t particularly stand out.  It’s a slice of life/school life series so there isn’t really much in the way of a linear plot but as the series goes on you see the character interactions start to become more significant and the comedy takes a backseat in order for more serious issues and developments to be brought up.  The more I watched, the more interested I became in watching how the characters interacted and how the story progressed.  

What was great about Toradora! then was that it started off as a light-hearted tale of two misunderstood love-struck teenagers but developed into a great story about growing up and finding your place in the world, even if you are a dragon looking for understanding and acceptance in a world where people think that you want to eat them because of your intimidating appearance.  Personally I love shows that start off with a comedic tone and get more serious as they progress so this was a huge plus for me, plus it had some of the most touching and (Tora)dorable moments of any anime I’ve seen.

For a slice of life/romance story with a fairly tried-and-true plot to stand out, there tends to be a need for a strong base built in your characters in order to set yourself apart.  This was probably the best aspect of the show because all of the characters were unique, flushed out, and on the whole very likable.  All of the characters were stood out in this anime and I can even say that down to the supporting characters I enjoyed everyone in Toradora!

In order to see a prime example of why the characters are so great and unique in Toradora!, all we need do is take a look at Ryujii, one of our love-struck protagonists.  Although he has the eyes of a delinquent, which leads people to think that he is a bad person, in all actuality he is one of the kindest, most caring people you could ever meet.  This theme of initial superficial appearances being different from what lies beneath is eventually applied to all of our main characters as the story progresses, which becomes the most interesting, realistic, and gripping part of Toradora! As we are given characters who, over the course of the show, have good development and display a wide range of motivations and emotions.

The best example of this would probably be a tie between Minori, Taiga’s best friend and Ryujii’s crush, and Ami, Kitamura’s childhood friend and a stupid Chihuahua (at least in Taiga’s eyes).  Minori started off as the sunshine of the show and brought about some of the best comedy in the series.  As the story progressed though, she became gloomy and distant, and her actions seemed totally out of character.  This total change of character and the reasons behind it was one of the aspects of the story that made me frustrated and confused but also kept me interested and made me want to keep watching to discover the reason.  As for Ami, when she was first introduced I figured that she was there to be the bitchy, prissy, “everybody look at me girl,” which she was for a while.  Once again though as the story progressed she showed that she was the most emotionally perceptive character and that even for someone who seems so mature and has the world figured out, it turns out that she’s just a normal, confused high school kid trying to find her way in life like the rest of them.  The only person who really didn’t seem to stand out to me in terms of character growth or development was Kitamura, Ryujii’s best friend and Taiga’s crush, who seemed mostly to be there for comedic effect in the end.

Moving on to the main protagonists I have to say that they were also very unique and showed some great depth as well.  Ryujii’s struggles with managing school, household chores, while at the same time trying not to be perceived as a delinquent were very realistic and I liked his generally kind and caring personality.  In addition to that his growth and maturity over the course of the series really developed nicely and he certainly impressed me as a character.  In regards to Taiga initially I have to say I was not very thrilled.  She seemed like she was going to be your typical tsundere with the whole “I’m your master so quit being a perverted dog” relationship with Ryujii for 25 episodes (her being voiced by Rie Kugimiya certainly didn’t help this case either).  Yet as the story went on you see that perhaps she is just socially awkward and doesn’t like her life of being feared and alone.  When you hear about some of the stuff that has happened to her you really have to sympathize.  Not since watching Fruits Basket have I seen parents be such assholes to their children like Taiga’s were to her.  Her developed background over the course of the series really made me like her more and her relationship with Ryujii grew and developed nicely from what it was at the start of the series.  Plus, she loves Christmas.  My stance is that anyone who like Christmas is alright with me.

The art for Toradora! was absolutely fantastic.  When at first I wasn’t particularly impressed by the story, the art kept me coming back.  Throughout the series it was always consistently great but then at times it seemed like the animators said, “You know what?  Let’s make the next scene look awesome,” and would then proceed to do so.  Sometimes it was only subtle effects but it was enough to make me love Toradora! for, if nothing else, how unique and impressive it looked.  I have seen other J.C. Staff works and I have to say they really brought their A-game for this production because it looks like none of their other works I’ve seen or anything else I’ve ever seen for that matter.

The voice acting in Toradora! was really fantastic as well.  It’s a pretty experienced and well-known cast who I felt all did great, although I particularly enjoyed Yui Horie’s performance as the super-weird and energetic Minori.  When it comes to theme pieces in anime I’m pretty easy to please.  But surprisingly for a show that I loved so much I did not like the theme music at all.  Once again the show was unique in this aspect because the music was like nothing else I’d ever heard before.  Unfortunately for the most part this meant that I just skipped over them or blanked them out, with the exception of the first ending, “Vanilla Salt” sung by Yui Horie, which is actually one of my favorite anime pieces of all time now.

In the end all I can say is that I couldn’t possibly recommend Toradora! any more.  If you’ve dropped it I say go pick it back up.  If you plan on watching it I say go start right now.  There are some things about it that people aren’t going to like, it’s going to be the same for all media and I for one can acknowledge what some of these aspects might be.   However for a show that I enjoyed so much there is no possible way that I couldn’t completely recommend it.  Worst case scenario you waste a few hours of your time and walk away with a nasty taste in your mouth.  However it seems like there's a good chance you’ll walk away after finishing Toradora! having watched a great series."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"I began Toradora thinking it was going to be just another romantic comedy. I had read various reviews, not expecting much from this anime at all, and so allow me to start of my review by saying: Toradora is phenomenal, stupefying, heart-stirring and just plain amazing. It exceeded all my expectations BY FAR and will surely leave a huge impact on rest of my life. After I finished the series, I was lost for words. I literally just sat there staring at my computer screen still astonished at what I have just completed.

The story of Toradora is unique and realistic. This is not your typical
                  ...
romantic comedy; it will leave MUCH more of an impact on you. The anime includes various twists and turns that left me pretty much speechless. There are times when you will be laughing your head off and there will be times when it feels like someone stabbed your heart, so when you get that lump in your throat, don't be surprised! What I love about Toradora is its overall message, and although I don't  want to give much out, I want to say that Toradora teaches you what love truly is. It is acquired by being yourself and not being afraid to express your own, true feelings. 

The art is not the best I have ever seen, but it is pretty amazing, still pleasing to the eye. You definitely will not have a problem with the art of Toradora; it is simple and fantastic. There are times when the art is really fitting to the scene, reflecting upon its meaning, leaving me in awe. 

Toradora's soundtrack is something that doesn't really stand out, but is fitting for the whole anime. When there are comedic scenes, there will be joyful music and when times are getting rough, there will be sad music. It's nothing extraordinary, but needless to say it is still great. 

The characters are another reason why I love this anime so much. There are 5 main characters: Ryūji Takasu, Taiga Aisaka, Minori Kushieda, Yūsaku Kitamura and Ami Kawashima. They have a complicated relationship with one another, but that's what makes this so realistic. Friends are not always nice and friendly with each other, but things do happen. Life happens. Each of them have their own unique personalities and fit extremely well with the story line. To be honest, I love all the characters and I can relate to many of them. Be sure to pay attention to the anime because there are so many little details that are extremely important and reveal SO much about the characters. The main female character, Taiga Aisaka, and the main male character, Ryūji Takasu are extremely fun to watch and always managed to steal my attention , getting me completely hooked to the anime. 

If it isn't obvious enough, this anime was beyond enjoyable to me. I loved every single minute and even though I am satisfied with the ending, I can't stop wanting more Toradora. Yuyuko Takemiya did such an amazing job with this anime, and I want to thank them for creating this masterpiece which in my opinion exceeds Clannad. If you don't watch romantic comedies, definitely give this a try, you won't regret it. If you like romantic comedies, I can assure you that you will be more than satisfied with this anime, and hopefully it will leave the same impact on you as it did on me."

severely awkward moments with their targets.

Story&Characters
It’s easy to pass off Toradora as just another tsundere romantic comedy with the same gags, character archetypes, character pathologies, and sitcom-esque setups that create awkwardly romantic situations. Indeed the characters start out lifeless and generic. The “dere” part of Taiga’s tsundere personality is cloyingly sweet, as if she is a maiden who hasn’t so much as had her skin defiled by the touch of a boy. The “tsun” part is unreasonably disagreeable, violent, and straight up mean. Ryuji always gets this end of her moody personality, and it’s difficult to see any human being with a semblance of pride and self respect standing the insult and humiliation he receives from Taiga, but he actually begs for more. Only a diagnosis of a severe masochistic disorder along with horrible self esteem could explain that. Suffice it to say the two main characters have an unnatural and off putting relationship at first. As the series moves on, it switches gears completely, but gradually, to a high school drama. The objects of the two main characters’ affections, a hyperactive girl, Minori, and an overly enthusiastic brown noser, Yuusaku, who were nothing more than gag fodder in the earlier half, as most side characters in tsundere/harem romantic comedies are, become fully fleshed out, though not particularly nuanced characters. In fact, the gags all but disappear after the halfway mark. Taiga, though still easily categorized as “tsundere,” becomes almost unrecognizable from what she was early on in the series. Her character mellows out a lot; she gets to be more apologetic, and because of this, her relationship with Ryuji, though still on the sadomasochistic side, at least resembles a healthy friendship.

The series then goes all out Asian Soap Opera, pulling out love geometry complex enough to stump a math major, family dysfunction, and the ubiquitous trials that friendships are put through due to crushes and the resulting jealousy; basically every trick a typical Asian TV drama has for dragging the tears out. Toradora is indulgent with the melodrama, and it’s hit or miss. It’s usually quite deft when it comes to the central romance and family problems. The situations and the ways the characters face them feel genuine, enough so that most people probably can find some common denominators in their personal experiences. The love and affection is surprisingly down to earth given the tsundere premise. No tearful kisses, thank god. The same amount of melodrama is applied to the characters’ friendships, but not to the same effect. Jealousy is the culprit of nearly every friend-to-friend conflict in the series, but melodrama is something that inherently does not suit that emotion. Envy is brooding and dark, not loud and whiny. There is but one character that comes close to expressing jealousy believably, but in the end, she, like all the other side characters, are simply “dealt” with, unnaturally resolving complex issues in simple ways so that the final BFF ending can happen. When melodrama goes wrong, it really goes wrong, and there may be scenes that are corny enough to make you want to plug your ears, close your eyes, and god forbid if you’re watching with a friend, laugh awkwardly to hide the embarrassment from the fact that you actually agreed to watch something so darned cheesy. I can easily see how one might feel differently, but if you ask me, the payoff tear jerkers are worth the occasional bits of torture.

Animation&Sound
Toradora is definitively superior to any other Anime drama I’ve seen in terms of animation. The character designs and vibrant color schemes in clothes and hair are reminiscent of fanservice-y harem gag comedies (which Toradora is quite far from), that is to say, they’re not particularly inspired or impressive, but the characters are consistently well animated, with none of the excessively stiff motions that most high school dramas, especially of the shoujo/josei variety, seem to get away with. Then you have those few sequences with animation beautiful enough to make nearly every action series green. It’s rare enough to see such liberal use of high frame sequences with impressive key animation in any TV series, let a lone a drama. There is one real fight scene, and the rest of these sequences are used on climactic chasing, fleeing, or falling. The fight scene aside, good animation may seem wasted on a drama, but it actually provides a much needed element that Anime sorely misses over its live action counter parts in the same genre: physical expression. The physical expression in Anime melodrama is way too basic. We’ve all seen chase scenes before: the characters run with robotic arm and leg motions, and the only form of physical expression is scrunched eyebrows indicating concern or worry for whoever is being pursued. The same scene in Toradora would have fully animated the pursuer’s body mechanics while sprinting; it would have shown slight random stumbles and slips while turning corners, all of this serves to highlight desperation that when expressed physically adds a layer of emotional depth over some generic verbalized thought like “please be okay…”

You would think that the production value would also apply to music, but it’s sadly absent, or so passive and muted that it might as well have been absent at the most crucial, climactic moments of the story.

--

Toradora is well paced in that it weans the viewer from comedy to drama gradually, but it never successfully integrates the two. In the latter half of the series a few old gags pop up very rarely, but they feel forced and unnecessary. People will probably have different opinions on each half of the story. To me, Toradora is generic and uninteresting as a Tsundere comedy. It doesn’t have a knack for laugh out loud humor, and Anime is saturated enough as it is with Tsundere gags. As an angsty, melodramatic high school drama, it’s painful to watch at times, but the frequent tear jerkers and occasional poignancy make the series worth finishing."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Why is it that we choose to watch a show rather than just read a synopsis of what happens during it? It's because the value of a show comes from more than just how it sounds when you summarize it: it comes from experiencing it, getting invested in a world other than the one you live in. It comes from the little things.

Toradora is all about the little things.

This is an instance where I feel the MAL system of evaluation breaks down: story, art, sound, character, enjoyment: what does it matter what each of these may be individually when you're never going to experience them
                  ...
individually? Yes, Toradora's premise isn't all that unique, nor does it deconstruct it or make any particularly unexpected decisions. Yes, the art is solid but not mind-blowing. But the difference between the 1970s animated Lord of the Rings movies and Peter Jackson's epic masterpieces isn't any of that: they're both telling the exact same story. It lies in the execution, the actual process of telling it. I would liken Toradora to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings in that both of them are a story that we've all seen before, and both of them nevertheless stand apart and above for doing it better, far FAR better, then anything that came before or after them. When you're watching an anime, all that you're ever going to experience is the ""overall"", and so that's the kind of review that I'm writing for Toradora. It's an ""overall"" review. 

Toradora follows the story of Ryuji Takasu and his high-school adventures with his group of friends, with the main five characters being Taiga, the short, feisty delinquent; Minori, the peppy go-getter; Ami, the vain yet self-conscious model; Kitamura, the upstanding cool-and-collected member of the student council; and Ryuji himself. From the beginning all five of these characters possess an enchanting depth and color, immediately defying the archetypes that we assume them to be. They converse like actual people, with captivating often irrelevant dialogue that is nevertheless extremely enjoyable. It's actually a pretty funny show (believe it or not, given the track record anime has with comedy), with what I found to be some solid laugh-out-loud moments that help to carry it along very nicely.

The character Ryuji initially grows closest with is Taiga Aisaka, and let me just say that I was absolutely blown away by her character. I've heard it said that Taiga is nothing more than a traditional Tsundere, and I would have to entirely disagree. I would find it hard to even classify her as a Tsundere, or someone who expresses their affection through coldness or aggression. At the beginning of the series it is revealed that Taiga has a crush on Kitamura, and throughout the entirety of the series she is outwardly caring, polite and forthright with him. There's nothing remotely Tsundere about it. This assumption instead spawns from the way that Taiga interacts with most of the other people in her life: she is blunt and easily angered. This stems not from some contrived shyness but rather from a fundamental fear of being rejected by the people she opens up to, a desire to be compassionate that has been buried by personal experience. Taiga's issues are much more deep-seated and pathological, and whilst at the beginning of the series I initially found her to be annoying and vicious, by the end she had essentially taught me to look at people in a different light. You DON'T know someone else just through a couple of interactions, and you don't know an anime character just because you've watched four episodes of their show. The idea behind Taiga's character is perhaps nothing new, but the WAY in which Toradora handles it is: it's compelling, believable and eye-opening. 

Taiga's not the only character the show manages to execute with divine grace: the two other girls, Ami Kawashima and Minori Kushieda (a name that has been forever etched upon my mind) add their own gleam to the outstanding cast. I don't want to go nearly as much into what makes them amazing for spoiler reasons, but I will say this: Minori Kushieda is without a doubt one of my favorite characters of all time. Ryuji himself is a very solid male lead: we've all seen the dark-haired young male protagonist through which the story is told, but Ryuji definitely lends it a new flair with his own tragically fitting yet often hysterical eccentricities involving cooking and cleaning, and his subtly masochistic nature. He also hits a perfect balance between being able to handle situations in a mature manner and not being turned into a Gary-Stu like SAO's Kirito. He's an intelligent boy who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to voice his opinions, but he can get hot-blooded or embarrassed and loses much of his functionality around his crush.

Speaking of crushes, do you like romance? Because that's where Toradora really tips the balance from ""amazing character study"" to ""one of the all-time best"" for me. 

Toradora: a romance like no other. Not because of some bold decision it makes, just because of the Toradora way: taking what has already been done and doing it that much better. I have said before that Toradora gets what love is, and I stand by that. It doesn't romanticize it or glorify it, it shows it for what it is: messy, confusing, difficult and beautiful. It has a grasp on real chemistry, and its romance feels as though it springs not from the creator's decisions but from the decisions that the actual characters would make. Feelings are not eternal: they change a bit with each new day, and what we experience can either reinforce or alter them. People are not ""meant"" for each other, and relationships are not founded on the simple joy of mutual affection: they take work, patience, experience, and time to mature. All of this is and always will be part of love, and its what makes it a wonderful, complex thing. Perfection is woven from the strands of imperfection, and that's what makes love such a perfect thing.

Overall? Overall I give Toradora a ""watch it"". It's one of the greatest things I've ever seen, and it's definitely my favorite romance. If you're seeking plot or action, take a pass on this one. It's simply not for you. But if when you hear ""outstanding characters"" or ""high-school rom-com done right"" your ears perk up and your heart beats a little faster, then open up watchcartoononline.com or whatever site you may use and start on episode 1. Enjoy!

*Note: Despite the controversy I'm sure this will cause, I recommend the dub over the sub. I've watched the series all the way through twice, one in each, and I thought that the dub was stellar and gave the character's voices more individuality. However, this is widely chalked up to personal preference so I wouldn't put too much weight on it."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"OVERRATED. 

Whenever someone asks me if I have watched Toradora! That is the first thing I will say to that person. The story is overrated, the characters are dull and the ending is ridiculous.

Now I have your attention, the plot. The plot is a pretty average boy likes girl, girl like other boy, ends happy but not really type of boring story you will see in American rom-com movies that is so predictable you can see in coming 2 episodes in. The story is set around a male protagonist called Ryuji Takasu who is apparently considered a delinquent because of his eyes and because of
                  ...
this feels he will never get a girlfriend. We discover he has been put in the same class as his best friend Yusaku Kitamura and a girl he has a crush on, Minori Kushieda. When he is at school he happens to meet the Taiga-chan, a short girl with a short temper which is why she is likened to a tiger and the two create a dysfunctional 'friendship' relationship based around on their crushes.

My friend and I reminisce about this anime from time to time and the initial reaction is how did we watch 25 episodes of this? It was terribly boring with a cast of people who were pretty uninteresting too and a lot of pointless episodes that just seemed like the studio had some left over money so put in a lot of filler.
The characters, I think, are the main thing wrong with this anime. We have Taiga, a short girl who seems to be ostracised for being short and quick to get angry which I have never seen in anime before ever. We also have Ryuji, a lead male character who is also ostracised for because people think he is a ‘delinquent’ because he has ‘delinquent eyes’ which seems like a really superficial thing for someone to base opinions of him to me but it is what it is. Then the other two, Minori and Kitamura, who seem to change their minds, attitudes and actions every ten minutes to benefit the main storyline. The interaction between the main characters seems really forced, with Ryuji taking a lot of grief  from Taiga and has to cook and clean for her because she knows he has a crush on a girl. I don’t know why he takes it for something that seems pretty trivial from where I am looking but there we go. 

The ending to this anime is just ridiculous. I vowed to have no spoilers in my reviews so I can’t say what the ending is but take my word for it, ridiculous.

I must say the start of this anime for me did offer some hope that I found something that would be good to watch but this hope was quickly taken away by the poor story I was being sucked in to. I also must say the dub and sub work on this anime was a good quality as was the art but it was quite easy to overlook these points with Toradora!

In conclusion, if you are looking for a first-class romance/comedy anime, run very far away from Toradora!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"*massive spoilers*
If the anime had the pacing and interesting twists like in the first 4 eps that got me hooked to it, then I would have rated it a 9. However, the paced slowed down considerably, the filler eps did nothing for me and the ending was a little too….. much for me. I mean, yeah you two like each other and stuff, but deciding to get married without actually having experienced life as a couple? That’s BEYOND dumb. Which is precisely why anime school children shouldn’t be considered a benchmark for romantic relationships, and precisely why they *are* considered a benchmark.
Needless to say, I
                  ...
didn’t like the ending because it was farfetched, cheesy and melodramatic.
If I had to only rate the 1st quarter, I’d give this anime a 9.
From eps 5-16, I’d give it a 6.
From eps 16-25, I’d give it a 7

On the plus side, though, ep 16 was the most beautiful/outstanding ep for me from the entire series. It was beautifully written and steered clear of romantic cliches, which I’m sure all fans enjoyed. 
A lot of things didn’t make sense to me, like:
# Why didn’t Taiga confide in her best friend about her crush?
# Why didn’t Taiga speak highly of Ryu in front of her so that she could see him in a better light? That’s literally the first thing to do when your buddy likes another buddy of yours
# Why is she more comfortable sharing her emotional issues with Ryu (except the daddy problem) than her bestie who she’s known for years?
# Why is Ryu so worked up when he sees Taiga upset on the stage during the paegent, but is totally chill when his best bud has a meltdown and colours his hair? He didn’t even *bother* getting to know what happened. If he wanted to give his bestie “space” then shouldn’t the same thing have applied to Taiga?
# Why does Ryu put up with Taiga’s constant physical and verbal abuse? Verbal I get; they need to make us laugh. But the constant and unnecessary physical abuse? Really? He obviously doesn’t like it and has said it out loud but why does he do nothing to stop it?
# Why is Taiga such a bully? I mean you can have a cold and “ruthless” demeanour without having to be such a bully to Ryu. The way she treats him is unacceptable, especially how she just demands things from him – like cooking her food or sewing her clothes. 
# Why does the bestie ask Taiga to be friends when she confesses her love to him? Either say yes, or say no. What’s this “friends” business which isn’t even explored (it’s completely ignored) in the series? 
# Since Ryu and his bestie both know Taiga likes him, why doesn’t Ryu just sit down and talk out his feelings with him? What’s the point of having Taiga hold on to something she doesn’t know the answer to?
# Ryu’s assumed to be a delinquent and he wants people to see him for who he really is. But this angle is explored only in the first 3-4 eps. For the rest of the series (barring 4-5 dialogues), this aspect is completely forgotten. Same with his habit of twisting his hair.
# I get that the mother is a ditz, but how the fuk are the grandparents okay with their teen grandson wanting to marry? HOW? 
# Taiga’s “reason” for leaving was fuking stupid. It wasn’t even a reason. Which still doesn’t explain why she didn’t show poor Ryuji the courtesy of a) telling him she’s leaving b) explain *why* she’s leaving c) do whatever improvement she wanted on herself by being by *Ryuji’s* side. Dumb girl.

There were other things that bothered me too, but then this review would be way too long. If anybody has any response to what I’ve posted above, please do drop by my profile. 

PS. I liked how it avoided many romantic cliches, which is why it annoyed me that the two MCs ended up together. Really? REALLY?"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"I decided to make a review on this coz people are praising this like it's the face of the Romance genre, it's not, I would argue Kaichou wa maid-sama but even that is flawed

Story: 1

there's hardly any story in this show tbh it's just about the two main characters love interests which got handle very poorly by the author, this is a poorly written ""love story"" I can't even call this a love story

first we have this the two main characters whom both have different love interests which means what's supposed to follow is both of them losing interest in their respective love interests while
                  ...
slowly develop romance with each other coz they're the main characters for pete sake but nah that ain't what happened at all and you'd expect the show would utilize itself having 24 episodes, our main male and female MC still madly greatly in love with their respective love interests in the final 2-3 episodes of the show I repeat there's hardly any romantic development between the love square, female MC even hallucinated and mistook Ryuuji for his crush, Ryuuji still madly in love with Minori, mind you Minorin and Ryuuji was about to have a 1 on 1 convo/confess at each but no worries Taiga is there to ruin the day and went on a tantrum spree, you gotta let them angst come out amirite angsty teenagers needs break amirite and the next day (final 2 episodes) the two main suddenly wanna live in together coz they're suddenly on a relationship smh talk about forced romance this is the most forced romance I have ever seen ever I can't believe this is the most recommended romance, RomCom coz this is just bad most of the episodes got wasted on some random moe SoL and male and female mains failed attempts to their respective love interests with Taiga beating Ryuuji and Ryuuji being the ultimate white knight

Art: 5

hardly a matter in this kind of show coz they usually have a good to average art

Sound: 4

can't remember if it's the first or second but it has a decent ending song while I can't even remember the opening songs coz they're so forgettable

Character: 1

Minori and Yasuko are probably the only likable characters in this show while the rest are downright detestable, forced and badly written ones especially Taiga, guess I'd expect no less from a violent tsundere, there's even this Ami chick who was implied to actually likes our male MC too but nothing happen in the end she was just there for the sake of it, I mean why add a character who won't even confess and try with Ryuuji, such a pointless character again this is a harem in guise of a Romance, people needs to stop branding this a major Romance coz this is a RomCom harem and it's a bad one

Enjoyment: 1

the only reason that I would watch this again is so I can get even more details and more evidence of how bad this show is coz I've watch this back in 2010 and I actually thought it was a good show back then, people praise this like it's the face of the Romance genre even tho it's clearly not

Overall: 1

this is lowkey harem in guise of a Romance, if anyone asks for a recommendation of a Romance, I wouldn't recommend this but for a RomCom I will coz they're usually a random with most of their episodes with a plot next to nothing with non existent story development and for this romantic development. and this pulled the most forced romantic build up I could ever think of"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Toradora. A rather different show. But an exhilarating experience that towards the end forces you to just sit back and enjoy the ride, with all the emotional ups and downs that accompany it. 

While not a unique concept, the story lends itself to exquisite execution, with a masterful telling of the hazardous, yet charming journey of two unlikely lovers. Even though no drastic measures are taken throughout the unraveling of the plot, by the end you feel a certain affinity to the entire cast which you can not claim felt for many other shows. And very little will leave you with the same warmth as
                  ...
Toradora. You cannot help but don the same wry smile which Ryuuji and Taiga commonly share.

The characters are an excellent mixture of quirks and shortcomings; and with a broad array as well. While Minori is warm and inviting (though odd), Ami is cold and standoffish. And then there's Inko-chan. But to focus on the two main characters is to shine every spotlight in the world on the most gleaming part of Toradora's composition. Ryuuji is fierce-looking, but the kindest, sweetest soul there could be. Taiga, on the other hand, looks like a fragile doll, yet is every bit as violent as Ryuuji looks. When the two come together, a satisfying clash is created, where a viewer can almost see the chemistry and the making of an everlasting love. An incredible warmth is felt in the viewers' hearts at every interaction between the mismatched duo.  A warmth that makes one hope for only their best, and a warmth you certainly don't want to let go.

On the AV front, the show manages to excel by rarely ever having outstanding QUALITY as is commonly seen these days. Whether or not Toradora was able to escape the budget shortfalls of other anime, or if its funds were more excellently appropriated remains to be seen. One thing is sure: Toradora is a visual and audial feast of which calibur will rarely be seen again.

In short, Toradora is a fantastic adventure through the complex rivalries of relationships, and a believable telling of the formation of a very true love. It's a show with feeling rarely felt in any sort of medium, and a show that no connoisseur of romantic anime should ever dare to miss."

It had left me in a way where no other anime has made me felt before. It was a unique and different feeling than anything I've ever felt before. Whether it was to do with the dramatic yet subtle entrance, or the closing, last few moments that were intended to be light hearted but at the same time very ""deep."" This anime had left me with a feeling like none other. The dramatic twist and the steady trend to lead to the final conclusion that had (to most people) left to leave the
                  ...
audience awed at how for once this was not a story to go with the obvious route that most had expected. Most anime do not take the turn that Toradora had taken, and that is what had made this anime beautiful and wonderful. The simplicity of this show as well, as it puts together the dramatic romantic scenes along with the light hearted comedic moments. It starts and finishes in two different lights, and when you are finished you are left to believe that these two parts were completely different, in which they are. This anime had found a way to make both the playful moments and the dramatic moments entertaining and enjoyable. The slow build up of emotions that is being piled up, the feelings that are flowing through behind the scenes, the inevitable conclusion that the two characters face. It all had led to Toradora being one of the best animes I have ever witnessed. I had found, no disappointment in this show, it had only left me with joy to the very end. 
P.S
If you want a deeper reason as to why Toradora could possible be one of the best romantic animes so far, (after you have watched if of course), then watch this review. But please, watch it AFTER Toradora. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fEkFtmIRU0

It's probably the dullest, most clichéd, yet best romance anime you're likely to see. Why? Because the competition just isn't there. Before I paint the devil on the wall at this point, I need to make it clear. I liked Toradora as an anime, it entertained me, and I also liked the character relationships, the romances, and the sometimes amusing humor. As a whole, the anime is quite entertaining, as long as you're looking for a simple teen romance. And since the market only has either harems or some over-the-top cliché bombs with no content, Toradora offers a counterbalance worth mentioning as a relatively over-the-top
                  ...
romance drama. 

First of all, what exactly did the anime do wrong? The biggest problem is the appalling lack of creativity. The anime drags on from one scenario to the next and the same sequence of events always happens. Taiga is blunt, Ryuuji has no idea what is happening and tries to help her although he receives no gratitude anyway. Minori and Ami, meanwhile, try desperately not to let the boat sink by acting as the two one-sided best characters. 

This isn't enough in the long run, unfortunately, and the fact that the whole thing has so many episodes and too little content to balance it out works hard on the atmosphere. Either you just see Ryuuji acting like a hero, giving swimming lessons, cleaning his apartment or you get an overdose of drama that only 14-year-olds can experience. On 16 episodes this would be very decent and you could keep the most important, but 25 episodes are way too much of a good thing.



But as said, the anime is better than one could claim. So despite the flaws, it manages to offer the viewer what he came for. To watch a subtle, slow, cliched anime romance. And that is exactly what one finds here. I don't like the choice of the protagonist at all, as Minori or Ami would fulfill a better lead role by far, but it is what it is. Regardless, Taiga and Ryuuji have a decent tsundere x protagonist relationship that builds over the series. You learn more about each character's relationships in between, and there are some amusing events and relationship problems. 

[Story 4]

As mentioned before, the biggest problem with anime is that it drags from one event to the next. You skip everything along the way and practically find yourself in the next arc, where the romance either gets a plus or provokes a Dramatic Event. 

Although the characters have appropriate backgrounds and their relationships are the biggest strength of this show, this is significantly watered down from this. 


[Characters 5]

Taiga is the only obstacle among the characters. If she were not such an aggressive Tsundere, there would be much fewer complications. Unfortunately, she is deaf in both ears and always averse to good suggestions. She acts like an angry 10-year-old and creates one problem after another. From time to time I am not sure if she goes to the right school. She's not bad from the ground up, but hurts the romantic potential and could have been plain better.

Ryuuji is...I like his personality and traits. Unfortunately, he's almost more of a side character than the protagonist. He simply has too little charisma to make himself noticeable. He gets lost in conversations and scenes and as long as he doesn't handle a main event, you almost forget that he is the protagonist. 

Ami and Minori are relatively similar as characters and that has nothing to do with me being too lazy to write and therefore summarizing it. Both are part of the drama of the relationship and both are the parents of the protagonists, who despite everything offer them constant support and manage to present the best and most amusing dialogues in the whole series. Ami through her adult nature and Minori through her maternal one. I also like the variation between their serious and silly personalities.

Only the character drama could have been left out here or at least done better, it's an unhealthy dose of over-dramatization.


[Animations 6/ Music 7]

Toradora has one of the most famous intros which almost everyone knows who watches at least a few years of anime. It's not to my taste, but I can't deny that it fits the style of the series and has a strong recognition value among other things. 

The animations in Toradora are strongly above average when it is needed. Unfortunately, the animations are not consistent and often vary greatly in quality.  


[Conclusion 6]


A big problem with Toradora is that the series is just too cliché and just can't offer enough variety to the viewer. It's not so much that the series has too many weaknesses, but rather that it has too few strengths. It can just about prove itself as an above-average romance, and just barely at that. 

And that's coming from a person who has watched this Anime 3 times by now."

                                      (24/25 eps)","Why I liked this anime?

1.  Amazing characterization. 
The story has depth, with healthy and detailed character development.  With a cast of 5 mains which consists of 2 guys and 3 girls; with a flurry of recurring and supporting characters from parents, pets, to classmates and teachers---let's just say the load is massive.  However, to the success of the writers I felt they are handling the job well.  I will say some of the main characters were late bloomers however, through the progression of the story lines/arcs the writers were able to definitely reorganize and enrich them.  So where I initially
                  ...
found them lackluster, the writers were successful in making them interesting to watch and get to know.   Added to that you can really connect with a lot of the characters. 

2.  Great story lines/arcs.
I definitely have to say there are arcs in the way the writers developed the story.  Because they have so many mains, to give them their dues there were arcs created to focus the specific main character and have the other characters respond to the actions, reactions, issues that arise.  So you're seeing the greater depth of all the characters as they are embroiled into the life events of one focused character.  You end up seeing the magnitude of emotion through anger, respect, laughter and tears each of these characters have with one another.  What's interesting is that this shows a depth that is transcended into the story.  So while some may not normally take a lot of animes seriously, this is one that gives you something to talk about.  The best statement I've heard in regards to the story is, ""pathos-invoking"" and I couldn't agree more.  The story and characters are definitely conversation makers.

3. The plot.
Basically romance and friendship arising in a high school.  Relatively cliche with twists and turns: meaning?  The plot moves from what I consider the cliche to the complex fast.  There is what I find, and liked, that the romance is more like a confused emotion for deep gratitude. Lots of these kids, when you're seeing their personal life are angsty kids living in a lot of drama; but it's the angst that provides a lot of understanding into them and they seem rather normal teens to me.

Some of the things that I found problematic.

1.  Slow development.
With some of the characters, I found them to be cardboard cut outs because they did nothing in the commencement but eventually did come into their own.  The problem with this is, is that it feels a little too sudden.  As though contrived.  It's very annoying to see the transition sometimes, because it seems the characters are a bit OOC. 

2.  Cliched teen angst.
Okay, I even summed this show up at times to Dawson's Creek without a creek and animed.  I remember, when I was in High School my favorite saying was that I was, ""Dawson without a creek and female.""  It just felt liker continuous angst.  So a lot of the time if you're a teen angst watcher or experiencer, you might get a bit annoyed by this.  Everyone sort of having feelings for everyone, or so it would seem, and no one knowing what they're doing.  

3.  Token characters.
Actually this is the most annoying for me.  Because I definitely did feel [initially] that a lot of the characters were token (this feeling does change through time).  This is very different from the novel version of the characters.  However, I put that down to compression problems and the art.  Meaning that the producers/writers on the anime have to deal with taking several volumed/chaptered stories and making it all fit.  So what happens?  A bit of lost translation of the full feelings or meaning of feelings by the characters.  This is also affected by the problem with the art.
But keep in mind this was later changed since the story develops more through specific arcs for each character bringing them out of token and into complex.  So the art and compression issue are small limits that are later broken through.

4. The art.  
Overall the art was fine.  Yet, I find the problems in really understanding the full meaning of the character or just the character in general is because of expression. I can name several animes in which the art was breathtaking and you really get into the characters.  Yet, in this one, I find it could have been better.  I felt in a way it affected the characters negatively rather than positively because their expressions just were either not fitting or unnecessary or a weird to interpret.


Overall?
I'm loving it, meaning I loved it!  Definitely a nice story and I think with some of the faults I found a great deal more of pleasure because the pleasure was on a regular basis, the faults can be easily ignored or later changed.  I do think it's a fun, ecchi (not as ecchi as it could be), slice of life story broken in by major teen angst.  Good stuff and definitely a great watch.   I recommend reading the manga and novel"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Alright.  Let me begin by saying I had high hopes for this anime, I legitimately thought that I, like many, would love it and find it one of the best rom coms in a long time.

I cannot say that, and it pains me.  Thus why I feel obligated to write this review, so that those out there, like me, who find themselves on the fence about this show will know that it is not for everyone and could be called a failure in its key aspect.

But enough of that now, onto the first section.

Story:

This here is the key to my entire disappointment, this
                  ...
section will cover the only flaw I find in the show(albeit one which breaks  this show) that's worth a really, really low score.  

As I intend to keep this spoiler free, I will do my best to be vague and as objective as a human can be.  Anyway, to start off,  I do have to give some sum up.  The show is about two people(Ryuuji and Taiga) who try to help each other find love with their respective friends(Minori and Yuusaku), but end up falling for each other.  Basic.  Simple.  Unusual for anime, but not unheard of in other medium. Yet somehow, the writers fail to appropriately dictate this correctly and botched much of could have made this show great.

Now then, let's point out some positives, as I'm sure you all are sick of my negativity.  This show has a great start, the two leads were fun to watch and their hijinks involved with the rest of the group, especially their attempts to woo their love interests was hilarious.  They kept stale traits of high school anime refreshing with new spins on old ideas that managed to really make them shine in comparison to any other show in the genre.  There's just one problem, there is no romantic chemistry between the leads, no build up in what should have been the best place for us to see them as developing feelings for each other.

In fact, the show almost negates feelings for these two, by showing how much interest each of them has in their two friends, Ryuuji and Minori have some great moments mid series that really show growth in their relationship and for the most part, there is a lot of reason to be seen of Taiga and Yuusaku becoming a genuine couple given time.

We even get another potential love interest for Ryuuji in Yuusaku's childhood friend, Ami Kawashima, who manages to steal a lot screen time and show a lot of chemistry also Ryuuji.  Which is not something that can be said of the leads and their relationship.  It is rather stagnant, with their characters establishing their relationship in this mess together early and hardly ever changing.

That is, until the writers realized this error and rushed basically the last quarter of the show with episodes shoving the two down our throats.  Everything becomes about their relationship, everything.  The side characters?   They push it forward or are obstacles that only drag it out another episode.  The story?  In the early series was a great mix of realistic setting with realistic reactions, to realistic settings with either ostentatious reactions or ones that are made entirely to drive the romance plot to its fulfillment in the last episode.


In case this section is TL;DR:  Most of the show and it's plot are good, but it fails in its most important moments and aspects.   Therefore it gets a 3 in story.

Art:

There is probably nothing bad to say about this show's animation.  It's fluid, energetic, and fits the show like a glove.  So for this section, the show gets a 9.

Sound:

Not something I am the most capable of explaining, so forgive my lackluster review of sound.   The music is fun and normally sets the ambience of a scene rather well, but never really hit a nerve in me.  Voice actors were great too, even the dub can probably be found enjoyable or considered decent by most people.  Therefore, for sound, this show gets an 8.

Characters:

Ah, we come to the absolute best part of this show and the key reason why I still hate how this show ended.  Every character, for the most part, is unique.  They feel like real people you'd meet, rather than fleshed out archetypes of a given cliche.

Save Taiga.  She's a tsundere, and that is who she is, for the most part.  How she develops beyond that is more often a reinforcement or explanation of her tsundere-ness.  It as though the writers crafted from pure tsundere the character that is Taiga, and this works to her benefit and detriment.  By which I mean to say that she pours out a lot of either aspect of tsundere, either she is full on tsun or full on dere.   The show usually managed to balance the aspects out, but there were often times where her tsun was simply overwhelming for those less appreciative of that character trait.

Again, though, beyond her, the cast is well rounded and, for the most part, real.  They act, they care, and they again, for the most part, grow as people.  It is rare that I find myself so attached to a group of characters, but this show captured my attention almost from episode 1 with them.  They were like friends I would have had in my high school days, which was perfect.

This section gets a 10, without a doubt.

Enjoyment:

I'll keep this section short, as I feel it is best summed up in the other parts.   Like I said, I enjoyed a lot of this show, from the beginning until late midway(give 9 or so eps left in the series), but the last section, where it tries to come all together breaks it, leaving us an ending that I personally found almost tragic, if truly studied beyond its assumed happily ever after, as one realizes much of what was said and done in those last episodes were done in the heat of the moment.  Many of those scenes were also then the cause of this show's end, which unfortunately means a rushed performance for the viewers and likely more than a few mistakes that could end in disaster for the characters.

Even though I had such a great time with this series, the bitter taste in my mouth and realization of the show's true end cannot let me give this part more than a 6.

Overall:

To bring it all around, I did have fun, I probably will still rewatch the earlier episodes on occasion.  But, a show like this thrives on its ending, which leaves a lot to be desired.  A pity, because this show was bound by its promise in concept, it failed to find what really mattered in it.  A story should be dictated by the characters and how they developed throughout, as this leaves them with the greatest, lasting triumph of being close to real.  It came so close, too.

The overall score is 7, for the earlier episodes, great music, art, and characters."

Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Having seen this anime five times now, I find myself wondering what it is about it that keeps me coming back to it over and over again. I would say at its core, it’s the characters. The characters aren’t particularly unique in design, and you could certainly break down the various character tropes and archetypes. But here the characters have such distinct personalities and are so fully realized, that by the end of it, you feel like you know these people. You care for them.  Take for instance Aisaka Taiga, the main female lead. On the surface she’s your typical tsundre character archetype. She’s
                  ...
aggressive, pushy and rough around the edges. But unlike a lot of tsundre characters, she has a lot of depth to her. She carries a lot of emotional baggage, and is actually quite fragile. Because of this, her actions are often underlined by her emotional struggles. It gives her actions meaning.  Even someone that isn’t a fan of tsundere type characters could emotionally connect to her and have empathy for why she is the way that she is. Or at the very least, there is an understanding to the actions rather than her just doing things to fulfill an archetype. Her personality is actually backed up by the things that shaped it. And that, in a nut shell is why this show is so special. You could look at Toradora! as a rom/com slice of life show on the surface, but it really has a lot more going on underneath everything. 

Outside of the characters, the show really does a great job balancing humor, romance and drama. Every episode is enjoyable on a basic entertainment level. But just as I described the characters having more to them then you would expect, so do most of the episodes. Often an episode has an underlying message or emotional story to tell. And the show just oozes with charm. I can’t emphasize enough at how likable the characters are, and how enjoyable most of the situations in the show are presented. As a result it’s a slice of life show where even the mundane actions are both enjoyable, but often feel like they have some kind of deeper weight to them. That’s an extremely tricky thing to pull off. But it’s because the characters are fleshed out, that these scenarios often feel like they are either building towards something greater, or is a deeper reflection of something that the character feels deep down inside. Because of this, even episodes that don’t have drama or a big moment to push the plot forward, still feel rewarding.  

The romance in this show is complicated.  But it’s because of this that I really appreciate it. Way too many romance stories are either I. the typical fairy tale romance where two people fall in love, and everything eventually falls into place. II. An extreme amount of drama and pain and suffering.  Toradora! Is a lot more subtle about a lot of these things. Don’t get me wrong, the show can become really melodramatic at certain parts in the plot.  But it feels more realistic in that, the drama is built up to, and even when it unfolds, it’s not straight forward in how it’s dealt with.  Often romance is complex, especially at a young age. And while Toradora! Is far from being a realistic drama, it’s actually one of the most realistic romance’s I’ve seen in anime, and it feels very raw and real.  The way characters deal with their emotions (or don’t deal with them), is really what makes the romance feel like something special (vs. a typical hyper-realized romance).  But perhaps the reason the romance works so well, is because the show doesn’t just view romance on a surface level (such as infatuation/attraction). While we get to know these characters as the show progresses, so too do the characters get to know each other.  And so, the romance feels more realized, as the relationships and the human connections start to shape their feelings.

Toradora! subverts your expectations, as it begins with a lot of the things that you would expect from a rom/com typical anime.  Taiga comes off as a typical tsundre.  Romance is portrayed by infatuation and surface level attraction. To be clear, those are actually very human traits.  Often when we fall in love with someone, it’s an unrealistic and “romantic” kind of love.  It is infatuation and attraction.  And so those elements are fine. But often romance in shows are only left to that, and as a result when the actual romance happens, it doesn’t feel as if the romance is based on anything beyond infatuation. Toradora! starts off this way, but as the show progresses you quickly realize that these characters are more then they seem, and the feelings they have change and grow as their relationships and experiences start to shape them. And ultimately, this is why Toradora! really is one of the best romance’s in Anime. 

This show isn’t perfect (what show is). If I had any gripes, I would say that there are plot elements that could have been handled slightly better. It’s not that the show didn’t have enough time, so this isn’t a case of where things were rushed. Rather, it was their choice on how they focused on certain things, that can kind of feel like a misstep. I won’t go into details as I don’t want to spoil anything substantial. But I’ll just say this, everything that is intended in the show, makes sense logically if you step back and take it all in. However, their focus on certain elements might make a certain plot development feel kind of rushed for some. If you understand that feelings and emotions are supposed to be developing in the background (even when characters aren’t necessarily showing it), then it makes more sense in the long run.  Conversely, I also had a problem with the ending with regards to this criticism of focus. Before I scare you off, the show wraps up in a fulfilling way. Some might be torn on the ending itself, but don’t worry, you will be satisfied with everything prior to the last 20 min, and the ending itself doesn’t change anything or move the plot away from the resolution.  But because the story is written in a way, where I personally feel it could have done a better job explaining what they were going for, it does come off as a little jarring and disappointing. But again, this is a case where if you step back and look at the bigger picture, the actions do make sense. Thematically it makes sense. And if anything, I think apart of the disappointment comes from the fact that you’ve come to love these characters so much, you just don’t want it to end. You want more. You’ve seen the journey, and the resolution. Now you want to see them enjoy that resolution. THAT is where I feel some of the disappointment comes from.

To wrap this up, I really think this is a special show.  I think it’s easy to look at this and not understand what all the hype about it is. On the surface, there isn’t anything particularly unique or special about it. There isn’t any insane action, drama, or world/conflict being set up. It’s a slice of life/rom com.  But what makes it special is the characters, and how fleshed out they are, and how it handles these characters emotions and their journey as they grow.  Not only that, it’s funny, romantic and charming as hell. This a show where you will be both entertained while also getting a little more than you bargained for.  And so, while I won’t be so bold to proclaim this as being one of the technically best anime, it’s really the overall package and how it all comes together, that really keeps me and many others coming back for more."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"[Adapted From Original Blog Post]

I'm sure you've heard this expression before: ""don't judge a book by its cover"" It's a very simple phrase, the meaning being that you can't judge something by what it appears to be, and it's a phrase that you hear repeated, over and over again, no matter where you go in your life. However, despite this, I think you'd be surprised by just how often we judge things superficially, whether it be anime, movies, situations, and most of all: people, way, way, too often. I bring up this for two reasons. This relates to the review because when you first see
                  ...
Toradora and read the description of the show, it's all too easy to completely dismiss, because on the outside, Toradora looks like every other boring slice-of-life/school romance anime that has ever been created, with a bland protagonist, nerdy best friend, and tsundere love interest all wrapped in a high-school setting that has at this point past the point of ""done to death"" and reached the point of ""this is really getting old, please stop"". But while on the outside Toradora may look incredibly bland and passionless, the product of the dangling flesh off of the actually interesting-looking shows of the season, included only to fill the space, it's actually possibly one of the most competent anime I've ever seen at exactly what it does and accomplishes by the end of its run. The second reason is while Toradora is undoubtedly a story about a misunderstood teenager named Ryuugi and a fierce girl named Aisaka Taiga discovering for themselves exactly what this thing called love actually is, it is also, somewhat, about ""judging a book by its cover"". About the dangers of stereotyping the people around you. About those personas we put on during our every day lives, when we're with acquaintances, friends, or even family. About those hidden emotions and desires that we never tell the world or can't admit to ourselves, that will eventually, inevitably, make themselves visible for all to see. And why that's okay.

     Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, I hope you've had a great day thus far, and welcome, one and all, to anime review 15#. Today we take a look at the heavily acclaimed slice-of-life-romance anime: Toradora(exclamation mark technically, but seriously, that will just mess me up so screw it), and maybe along the way, find out for sure who ""best girl"" really is. Now then, let's begin.

Toradora was brought to us by the animation studio J.C Staff, a studio that I""m quite fond of, even if few seem to share my view point. They've brought us nice little shows over the years, all three seasons of Shakugan no Shana, Selector Infected WIXOSS, Ano Natsu de Matteru, A Certain Scientific Railgun and its sequel A Certain Scientific Railgun S. If you were to put me on the spot, I'd perhaps say that Toradora remains their strongest work(though arguably WIXOSS and Railgun S are better), which sort of shows that they typically don't produce particularly exceptional anime much of the time. That's why it's surprising, I guess, to see an anime like Toradora come from them.

      The director was Tatsuyuki Nagai, who you may recognize, and for good reason, since he is a quite exceptional director. He's brought us works such as Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, Ano Natsu de Matteru and A Certain Scientific Railgun, which sort of makes it odd that he directed something as mature as this anime. It was written by Mari Okada of WIXOSS, Anohana, Nagi no Asukara and Gosick fame, and the series aired between October 2, 2008 and March 26, 2009. Into the plot. 

Ryuuji Takasu is ready for the best year of high-school he has ever had. Till this point, he had been shunned by classmates for his fierce looks and eyes that seem to glare at whoever he looks at, so he has had trouble making friends and convincing the teachers he doesn't want to beat them up. However, this year, not only is he in the same class as his best friend: Yuusaku Kitamura, but also the girl he has had an borderline-obsessive crush on for the last few years on: the optimistic and cheerful Minori Kushieda, but since Ryuuji has absolutely no intentions of confessing his feelings, well ever, he is content to watch on without doing anything. The second thing to happen on his first day of school is that he meets Aisaka Taiga(and by meets I mean she punches him in the jaw and walks off). Taiga has earned the nickname ""Palm-Top Tiger"" throughout the school, because while she is so short that it's easy to mistake her for a small child, she has a violent and aggressive personality and will take absolutely nothing from anybody.

After this meeting, it would seem like the two would like nothing more to do with each-other, however, various circumstances draw the two together again, as Ryuuji accidentally discovers Taiga's love letter to Kitamura. After calming her down enough so she won't impale him with her sword, Ryuuji strikes a deal with Taiga: he'll help her confess to Kitamura properly, as long as Taiga helps him get closer to her best friend: Minori Kushieda. I'm sure you can see where this is going. So, as the two agree to help each-other with their own romantic endeavors, they not only begin to discover the true nature of their respective crushes, but also each-other, as Taigi learns that Ryuuji is not in fact a no-good delinquent as much as actually a really nice guy, and Ryuuji learns that there is far more to the Palm-Top Tiger, his group of friends, and the very nature of love, than he could possibly imagined. This sets the stage for one of the, in my opinion, absolute best slice-of-life/romance/drama anime of the last decade, that along the way turns from exactly what you expect to something you never saw coming, and by the end, has more profound things to say about love, relationships and people than any romance Hollywood or other mediums have produced for the last few years. An anime not without flaws, but deserves all the praise I'm about to give it.

The first thing you need to admit about the nature of Toradora is that it is built primarily on a foundation of cliches and archetypes. This is not an original plot, many have done this story before and many more will do so in the future, and, at least at first, all the characters are cliches you've seen a million time before. Ryuuji is ""the nice guy"", Taigi is such a tsundere that she has pretty much become a poster-child for the archetype in the last few years(along such ""deres"" as Asuka from Evangelion, Senjougahara Hitagi from Bakemonogatari and Shana from Shakugan no Shana), and all the other characters fit into archetypes such as: ""the guy with glasses"", ""the ball-of-energy"", and ""the manipulative bitch"". Locations are pretty typical as well, because when it isn't school it just has to be a festival, or a beach, or pick whatever cliche you want out of a hat. However, what you really need to give Toradora credit for is how it handles these familiarities of the genre, instead of letting everything play out in a typical way, it actually takes these archetypes and crafts and develops them, investigating the ever-changing character dynamics and relationships and uses them to hammer home its thematic point, which is not easy to do no matter what genre you are talking about: to deliver a firm message without sacrificing characters or exposition to make sure you get your point across.

It just takes a little while to get there is all. You will undoubtedly watch the first half of Toradora with a judging look on your face, because it's really nothing that special. Sure, a few moments split up the mediocrity in that time frame, but the first half of Toradora is hardly anything you've never seen before in a million other slice-of-lives. It's not bad by any means, after all, the show has a good sense for comedy and cuteness(particularly in Taiga's case), and the characters are enduring if one-dimensional, but no doubt you might be wondering what all the fuss is about for these span of episodes. It wasn't till much later on, at the end of the school festival arc that I was really sold on the show, and that's a whole 13 episodes in... which you know, is more than half the show, so that's a huge problem really. What I want you to take out of this section however, is not to let your expectations drop this show in the first half, because that will ultimately let down the experience of the whole show. Instead, appreciate a little the build-up and moving character pieces in this first half, because undoubtedly, this first half is a very well orchestrated, very meticulous set-up of the story contextual and thematically. How about I put it like this? If you took the first half of the show and cut it entirely, the show would fall apart at the seems, because what the first half is most definitely not is filler, and for that, I'm grateful. And hey, it's still not terrible, so if you like these kind of shows you should be more than entertained for this first half.

     But yes, I've built it up enough, so I'll admit it: the second half is where the anime really comes alive for me. Suddenly it isn't watching stereotypes amble through a non-existent plot, it's watching characters grow and change as their emotions and desires push forward the plot to an inevitable and emotional conclusion, making the last 5 or so episodes of show tense and satisfying as all these relationships that the anime had built up in that first half play out and collide, and it's satisfying as hell. That's one thing I really give Toradora credit for: it has an ending, and not just an ending, but a perfectly concise and complete ending, that leaves no room for a satisfying sequel or anything like that, and that's something I think is a little under-appreciated: an ending. Mostly how these slice-of-life play out is that they end inconclusively; relationships still developing so they never actually go anywhere, and plot-lines unfinished because there wasn't enough source material or whatever. This completeness is what puts Toradora above other anime of the genre, it just doesn't hint at relationships between characters and leave the two in a sort of ""shipping limbo"", it fully explores each and every one, giving each plot-line a conclusion, as well as each character. And after 25 episodes of watching these characters, you are completely and totally satisfied with what you have seen, and me personally, didn't want to see anymore. That's rare, especially for an anime, where you are lucky if your favorite show even gets a third season after leaving the story at a crappy cliffhanger(yes, I'm looking at you Spice and Wolf(and yes, I'm still bitter)). Some may not like the ending because it wasn't quite what they were looking expecting, but I thought it was great, and rather sweet as well.

     I guess the biggest problem with Toradora as a whole is that it holds back itself by simply being what it is, and yes I intend to explain that further. What I mean is that while Toradora takes what it has and develops it wonderfully, it still doesn't manage to break free of the shackles of the stereotypes and archetypes it has surrounded itself with. It's still an ""anime rom-com"" at heart, which means for all the great drama there is plenty of melodramatic moments, for all the great dialouge there is a couple exchanges that will no doubt make you groan, and hell, there's even a little fan-service along for the ride(though it's thankfully very, very scarce). Now, I'm not trying to say you can't craft an amazing story out of a very familiar premise. For example, the manga Stealth Symphony managde to take the typical shounen formula, setting, and protagonist and practically transforms every aspect of it into something unique and entertaining by the end, practically deconstructing its entire world, but despite this, it still is true to what it is, never feeling like a satire or a genre deconstruction. So yes, despite the archetypes and despite the setting, I think Toradora still could have been able to craft them into something that was so good that the familiar formula did not matter. I just don't think it quite gets there. Which is a shame, but nowhere near a deal-breaker.

A common criticism I've seen of Toradora is that it's predictable: that it isn't hard at all to determine who is going to end up with who by the end of the series, and I've got a couple of mixed feelings about this problem. First yes, you can pretty much see where the entire series is going from the second episode, not all the great twists or development or emotional scenes, but you'll probably get an idea of the final placement of things. On the other hand though, the anime doesn't really have any intentions of trying to conceal the end placement of the relationships of the characters, in fact, you could argue that it spoils the ending in the very first episode, and it does this because the anime has a point to make and a moral to teach, and regards anything that would stimulate contextual tension, well, I wouldn't say irrelevant, but rather less important than the message. That's great and all, and I appreciate that Toradora never really backs down from that stance and tries to make unnecessary drama, but at the same time, tension and uncertainty are very important tools in keeping your audience engaged with your story, and without either for the most biggest question of the entire show... is a questionable decision, at least in my opinion. I recognize that this won't be as much as a problem for some people, or others might not pick up on the message so it won't matter, but still, I felt I needed to address that before I moved on. Now, let's talk about characters.

So for characters, I'm going to do something a little different. There's five main characters of this show that you need to remember, and I'm going to tackle them out of order for the most part, just so I can save what I really want to talk about for last. But first, our main character: Ryuugi, how does he hold up as a character? Well, I'm sorry to say, not great. Despite other archetypes in the show getting development to justify their behavior, Ryuuji very much stays in the role of ""the nice guy"" for the entirety of the show, and he doesn't exactly have any interesting conflict or drama, he just mostly tries to do what he thinks is best for everyone. What I do want to talk about, and what I consider the only really interesting part to his character is how the show turns those good intentions against him, particularly at the end of a certain arc, where it's brought into question whether Ryuuji tries to help people without truly knowing how to fix their problems, and ends up making the situation worse. It's a rather cool idea, but sadly it doesn't get brought up too much, so ultimately,while he isn't a bad character, sadly our lead looks rather flat compared to the rest of the cast.

     Minori is the target of Ryuuji's affections, his crush throughout the show, and who he seeks to get closer to for its entire duration. She is a cheerful, optimistic girl who, in the words of Ryuuji ""is as radient as the sun"", who looks to spread merriment wherever she may be, which allows her to deal with Taiga's quirks or whoever else she might be dealing with, like a character I'll be talking about in a little bit. However, this personality cloaks a girl with serious issues when it comes to how she views other people and herself, a cloak that the anime spends plenty of time slowly stripping away to show the rather depressed girl inside. Now, I recognize that Minori's character as a concept is nothing exactly new, but you rarely see this kind of character as well developed t as she is, and not in terms of huge revelations, but rather that the anime provides a very clear reason for every action she takes in the anime, even if those reasons are sometimes buried under layers of subtly or metaphor. And on a personal note, her character's resolution in the last episodes is by far my favorite in the entire show; just see for yourself, it's just awesome.

     I think Kitamura's character was sort of pushed to the side to make room for the development of the other characters. He's by far the worst and least focused on character of the anime, only getting a single arc to himself, which means that all his development needed to happen in that single arc, which means that said development is rushed and not very well handled. In his role as Taiga's crush, Kitamura sort of plays the role of the down-to-earth character, one of the only ones who recognizes all the barriers that his friends have put around themselves and allows him to see people for how they truly are, which is why he makes friends with Ryuuji despite the rest of the class being scared away by his looks and eyes. But there's also a slight problem in there, because while the anime tells us that Kitamura and Ryuuji are best friends they rarely act like it, Kitamura almost being in the role of the ""knowledgeable-onlooker"" for the whole show. Rather stale as a character really.

Ami is best girl, and if you disagree, we can chose a time and place to fight later, for now, I want to defend my answer. By ""best girl"", I don't mean Amy was the one I was rooting to end up together with Ryugi at the end of the anime(I was more or less on Team Palm-Top Tiger for the whole time), but what I mean that Ami is probably the most interesting character in the entire show, so let me explain why. Introduced in episode 5, Ami is a child-hood friend of Kitamura, who due to her stunning beauty, works as a model and spends time outside of school of the first four episodes of the anime. However, her sweet and dainty personality is nothing but an act she puts on for her classmates and acquaintances, hiding a cold and manipulative girl who views herself above others and is not afraid to verbally abuse anybody she doesn't like. That of course, until she meets her match in Taigi, Ryuuji and Minori. I say that she's the best character because she's the one who most illustrates the message of the show while still being to go through her own well-paced arc, trying to earn the admiration of classmates by changing her personality, but she's ultimately a tragic character, because she can't earn the admiration and love of the people she actually respects because they see her not as the perfect model that she projects, but rather a normal girl. She's also the one to voice of one of Toradora's most interesting themes, that is ""love vs admiration"", which I won't spoil for you, because I want it to be something you think about for yourself when the anime raises it, but I think it also speaks volumes for her character and development.

    And now it's finally time to talk about the main heroine of the anime, the Palm-Top Tiger: Aisaka Taiga, and I must say, I love this girl; she's one of the most enduring characters I've come across in anime. Taigi is a tsundere beyond a doubt, but like Minori, the show takes the archetype to its full potential, going into detail of what circumstances would drive a person to adapt a ""tsundere"" personality, and this of course leads her to being the second-best character in the anime, only second to Ami. However beneath her hot-headed surface personality, Taiga is revealed to be a somewhat clumsy and quirky girl, unable to control her own emotions which leads to her making bad decisions, which is why having a best friend like Minori(and of course Ryuugi) to control her, is so good for Taiga, as they are able to look past her pride and sarcasm to help the well-meaning girl underneath. And while her tsundere personality traits get a little tiring in the first half of the anime on occasion, she does somewhat ""drop the act"" in the second half, as you discover the true reasons behind her personality. I know she's the main focus of the show for all intensive purposes, and with that should come perks for her character, but she's well handled as a character no matter how you look at it, a tiny, fierce, sweet, strong, prideful tiger that at the end of the day, just wants the best for the people she cares about... plus, she's kind of adorable as well, if we're being honest.

As we move into animation, I'm sorry to say that J.C Staff won't exactly impress anybody with their work here. Their studio has never been particularly the ""crisp-of-the-cream"" in terms of animation(in fact I think the only time they impressed me with their animation quality was in Railgun S), but still, considering how good this show actually is, I would have liked to see some extra effort put in. Colors and backgrounds are extremely bland, making the anime miss some vibrancy and life in certain scenes, plus, character designs are pretty standard as well(beside Taigi, strangely). It very standard looking, which is why I appreciate even more how the production value seemed to go up as the anime continued. Now, admittedly, this just might be me hallucinating, but I swear everything in general looker better in the second half of the anime, particularly the last few episodes. What I can confirm is that the animation production will increase exponentially during scenes of great importance in the latter stages of the show, and they do look very nice, giving even more power to scenes that are emotional and well-written on their own, so thank you for at least that J.C Staff. Overall though, it's nothing too special. 

The same goes for the OST. Thought the music was done by Yukari Hashimoto, who has done some actually rather brilliant OSTs such as Mawaru Penguindrum and Yuri Kuma Arashi, Toradora's is rather standard, plenty of cheerful slice of life jingles and calm piano pieces inter-cut with various instruments. It's not all bad I guess, and some tracks such as ""Kaze no Kiite"" and ""Psychocandy"" are rather catchy and upbeat, which do well for background music, if nothing else. However, there is one song within this OST that I can safely categorize as brilliant, and that is the song ""Lost My Pieces"", a truly haunting yet beautiful song ripe with emotion, that plays during one of the biggest emotional high points of the show, and damn is it effective. As for openings, I know a lot of people prefer the admittedly catchy first OP: ""Pre-Parade"", but I find it a little annoying to be honest, and much prefer the second opening ""Silky Heart"".

It took me awhile to actually figure out how much I liked Toradora. As much praise as I've been giving it, it was always in the back of my mind that this was at its core just another slice-of-life/romance, but at the same time, I was wondering how much I could actually penalize the anime for that. However, through writing this review and taking a look back at the show a few months after I initially finished it, I've come to the conclusion that I sort of love this anime. Yes, it's cliche or maybe even melodramatic at poinst, and yes, some characters are sacrificed for others, particularly the supporting cast, and hell, even if I don't, I know a lot of people hate the ending. But for me, Toradora at the end of the day is absolute proof that an anime can be more than the sum of its parts, that it can take all of these things and situations we've seen so, so many other times, and turn them into probably one of the best slice-of-life/romance anime we will ever see. And yeah, I know that's a big statement, but after looking at the thematic under-pinning, and the characters, and how well built up almost everything in the anime actually is, I find that Toradora makes it onto the list of anime that I can completely recommend no matter who you are, because it truly has something for everyone, and it truly has a profound point to make that we all can and should take to heart and apply to our lives. And hell, there's not a lot of pieces of entertainment in mediums that can say that. So yes, the Palm-Top Tiger has won me over at the end, and I'm thoroughly pleased to be counted as one of the people who love this anime.

Final Verdict: 8/10


For this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Toradora! at first seems like a cliche romance series. There's been so many, it seems, over the years; it would have to take one outrageously different (yet subtly very simple and not complex) story to grab a person's attention and keep the viewer wanting more. After all, it's been done hundreds of times, and 99.9% of the time they end up corny or just plain stupid. I'm happy to say that Toradora! is a fresh take on a romance story, but with a major twist: the main characters aren't your typical main characters, and their interactions go above and beyond what's usually expected.

Story: 10/10

The story
                  ...
is, of course, an outstanding 10 out of 10. I try not to give a perfect score unless something truly deserves it; but this time, I was genuinely (and very pleasantly) surprised. Toradora! definitely starts off a little awkward, and you may be tempted to just drop it as quickly as possible. However, I implore you to stay: the comedic moments and clumsiness at key times make the characters seem more and more like that one friend of yours that has (insert blank) personality. I was impressed at the honesty and stark portrayal of the characters; they bypassed my expectations, and continued to throughout the whole series. 

A little background that covers it in a little more detail: it so happens that Taiga Asaika has a crush in a guy named Yuusaka Kitamaru. It gets a little more complicated; Asaika's neighbor, Ryuuji Takasu, happens to like a girl named Kushieda Minori. What makes this so convoluted is that Kitamaru and Takasu are best friends, and Minori and Asaika are also best friends. So the natural thing to do would be to help each other out, right? Let's just say it gets interesting. Misunderstandings, awkward pauses, hilarious banter, and countless other little things happen; and through it all, you snuggle a little closer to each character, as they develop and progress. 

Art: 10/10

Oh, how can we forget the art? I try not to give art a 10/10 often; but here, something amazing happened; we got faces. We got the ""I'M SO MAD I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU"" face, the ""THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING"" all the way to ""THE WORLD IS DEPRESSED, AND SO IS MY FACE."" Good gosh, I've only seen facial expressions drawn in such human pathos only few times before. This sold me; from the first episode, it caught my attention and held it. The environment was drawn nicely, yes, so were the various objects or classrooms or homes. But you're not paying attention to such trivial detail when you can gaze upon these perfect, gorgeous facial expressions. I seriously became transfixed halfway through the episode. If you were to mute the volume and not understand a word of Japanese and not read the subtitles, you could probably still understand exactly what's going on. The arm movements and body posture were secondary; but this, THIS is something else! 

Sound: 9/10

So the 'sound' category encompasses not just the ED and OP, but the character's voice acting, sound effects, and background music. The OP I memorized instantly; catchy and bouncy, it was the epitome of the show. I always listened to the whole thing, simply because of the way it caught my attention so quickly. The ED was similarly tasteful, however a little dull since the mood of the OP and ED matched so nicely. I wanted something different to wrap up the anime rather than identical songs. The character's voice acting was astounding. Accurate and polished, I almost forgot I was watching anything; I became a character within, watching with my own eyes. The voices and characterization seemed so surreal and positively charming to listen to, I swear it was close to hypnosis at times. The sound effects were your typical stuff; things dropping, tables scraping, feet walking. The background music was almost non-existant; that disheartened me at times, but that also made the mood seem more stark in contrast to the events going on, so a little absent background music wasn't bad. 

Character: 10/10

Toradora! would've fallen flat on it's face without the cast of amazing characters. Just because Aisaka and Tukasu fit into that typical role doesn't mean the other characters did. Aisaka is and always will be a tsundere that everyone loves; a stereotypical one at that, conscious of her small stature and conflicting emotions. She continued to amaze me throughout the anime; her character arc was a roller-coaster of emotions and non-linear personality quirks; she changed as often as a guitar solo; never quite the same, but always going off on tangents. Takasu was your main protagonist, and the story was told mostly from his point of view; not that I didn't mind that. A neat-freak and woman-like about his household chores, he really symbolized a perfect house-wife(husband?) sort of person, yet was indecisive all the same. Kitamaru is brilliant, but lacks common sense sometimes. However, he knows more than he reveals, and continued to surprise me throughout the series, dolling out hidden information here and there that revealed his true self. Kushieda Minorin was probably the most interesting character of them all: she appeared the perfect air-head, incapable of knowing what's going on in the world around her. She almost pulls if off perfectly - except she reveals her true self a few times, notably to Takasu. Instead of an oblivious girl with no direction, she actually had inner theories and thoughts, and described certain feelings of hers with complicated metaphors; but that's what made her interesting. Ami, a character later introduced, seemed sort of a bridge for the other characters, providing a mental link, if you will, between Takasu and the rest of the gang. She's like that rickety bridge over a roaring river; sometimes, it seems like a good idea to trust her; other times, she seems as fickle as Asaika.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Toradora! with all my tiger-like heart. What little flaws there were just simply faded or disappeared; there were too many good qualities that the bad seemed as insignificant as an ant. To put it bluntly, I loved this. I started off with a simple recommendation from a friend; but everything he recommended turned into a tear-jerker or epic action sequences; this turned out to be the latter. Instead of trudging to the next episode, tired and dejected from the previous one, I hurriedly and hungrily watched them as quickly as possible, because every detail was precious. After all, a dragon and a tiger can only do so much together..."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Toradora! ...where do I start? I just finished this anime and I'm still smiling. The story is just absolutely wonderful. The anime was so wonderful that I had to write a review for it right away while everything was fresh in my head. If you love anime that has great, unique characters, love-polygons, and comedy that will make even the saddest bunch laugh then you'll definitely love Toradora! At first, the title really didn't interest me. That's the first thing we all see from an anime and that is its TITLE! The next thing we see is the cover art. I saw the title and
                  ...
I thought ""toradora!"" ? doesn't really sound interesting. I read the genres and saw the cover art and I told myself that it didn't look half-bad. Boy... I was wrong about the anime, I started watching it and didn't stop till the next day. I skipped my dinner and sleep for this anime and i'll break it down for you guys right now.

~STORY
Just let me start off by saying the story is unique and extremely cute. I would even say it rivals that of Clannad but in the end, Clannad still squeezed through by a bit but I'll leave that for another review. Toradora! will seem like the typical love story at first where a boy loves a girl and another girl loves the boy's best friend, so the two team up to help each other out. Yeah... it's pretty typical, but the creators did such a good job at leading the viewers to think this for a good 15 episodes until you suddenly start to see the change in the story... a change that was pretty unsuspecting to the viewer. The climax of the anime was not anti-climactic whatsoever, the creators did a wonderful job at keeping the viewers on the edge of the seat wanting more. The ending made my heart ache at first but then a sudden twist that relays a message from the beginning of the anime got my heart to skip a beat and just made me fall in love with the anime. The ending to Toradora! is one of the cutest endings ever; it would have been the cutest ending if had not been for Clannad to take first place there. Toradora! is the second anime to have ever made me laugh and cry and jump out of my seat in excitement. I gave the story a score of 9 because even though it was one of the sweetest stories I have ever heard, I still felt that Clannad is still ahead.
~TRUE SCORE: 9.5/10

~ART
The artwork was eye catching. The artwork definitely did it's job. When the scene called for a serene atmosphere, you got it. When it called for an eerie atmosphere, you got it. When it called for a cute and sweet scene, you definitely got it. The artwork covered all range of the spectrum even during moments where it called for extreme dramatization. The title of Toradora! didn't really catch me at first, it was the artwork that reeled me in and convinced me to watch it. I gave the art an 8 because it was definitely great, but there were some scenes when I thought that they could have done better. (i.e. the bird was a bit to... comedic)
~TRUE SCORE: 8.5/10

~SOUND
The sounds of the anime were your typical anime sounds, some sounds I've even heard from other anime. There's really not much to say about it. I'll talk about the seiyuus in the characters.
~TRUE SCORE: 7/10

~CHARACTER
The characters were amazing. The development of each character definitely excelled among other anime. You learned about each of the main characters and majority of the supporting characters. The anime included a comedic relief in multiple forms but did not overdo the comedian. The two main characters would be Ryuuji and Taiga. The way they really made these characters are just... I really have no words to describe how much I loved those two. Despite Clannad receiving a higher score, the characters of Toradora! and Clannad are perfectly even here. They didn't leave out any characters nor did  they cut short on any characters. They definitely gave it some thoughts on their characters. They gave Taiga a personality you would call a tsundere but the way they tackled it felt like they didn't rush it nor push the personality on her. The way she changed was subtle and excellently executed. The seiyuus they chose for the characters really did match how I would imagine the characters to sound like. Especially that of Aisaka Taiga. The reason why I loved the seiyuus they chose is because not only does the music, the art style, and location sets the mood of the anime but it's really the voice actors and actresses that seals the mood and they couldn't have chosen anybody better for each character.
~TRUE SCORE: 10/10

~ENJOYMENT
I was kept on the edge of my seat at all times. Even though I skipped my sleep and dinner, I neither felt tired nor hungry. I did not even yawn! The story was just too captivating and the comedy came at the right moments to really keep you glued to the screen.
~TRUE SCORE: 10/10

~OVERALL
Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anybody that loves a good love story. If you've watched Clannad and loved that then I would definitely recommend Toradora! Toradora! is just one of those ""must see"" anime, in my opinion. It includes drama, romance, comedy, and even a bit of action in a few episodes. I gave it a 9 because yes, I enjoyed it and this anime made it to the top of my list but my number 1 spot still belongs to Clannad, just by a little.
~TRUE SCORE: 9.5/10"

                                      (6/25 eps)","One heck of a must-seen anime from the lead voice actor/actress of Shakugan No Shana and ZnT with the same personality as well. It's like watching those two animes in a different level.

Imagine a normal rom/com school anime but the characters were Yuuji(from shakugan no shana) and Louise(Zero No tsukaima) and Shana(of course Shakugan No Shana). Based from the first ep I don't think this series is an ecchi ones, I haven't seen any on this episode.

The male protagonist is being mistaken as a delinquent student because of his eyes though his character and trait is more like Yuuji from Shakugan No Shana, nice and
                  ...
doesn't seem to be an ecchi guy like Saito from (ZnT) because they both have the same voice actor same as well for Taiga.

The female protagonist, is like Shana + Louise = Taiga, she acts exactly the same, but this time she's the irresponsible one, not to mention Taiga also says &quot;Urusai, Urusai, Urusai!&quot; which was Shana's famous lines and &quot;Baka!&quot; from Louise

I don't want to spoil this series so just watch it for you to know better and I would suggest this one a worth watching somehow

Enjoyment = 8/10"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Toradora is very good anime. It changes your life... for the better. In fact it's so good that if someone right now was about to tell me I was gonna die tomorrow, I would rewatch the whole series before leaving this beautiful Earth for my version of anime heaven. No matter what your background is, if you just don't get along well with your parents, if you didn't have the childhood you wanted or if you had or have love problems or if you just wanna smile at very funny situations and character dialogues... everyone can relate to the Toradora anime and characters in some
                  ...
way.

Toradora is a story about Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji that eventually grows into love story. It's a story of world of emotions and feelings that change through time. There are many funny situations, those lovely awkward love moments, interesting and cute characters. Everything you want from this anime genre mix-up: Comedy, Romance, School, Slice of Life. I won't go into plot details as not to spoil for those who might watch the anime. Let me say oly that: when you start watching it, you just can't stop until you watched the last 25th episode. Hint: make sure you watch the last episode right to the end past the end credits or you might miss the crucial epilogue.

Taiga Aisaka is 16-year old high-schooler. Due to her family situation and her history Taiga is very afraid of her own emotions. Because of her being teased by schoolmates (she is small and has small/no breasts for her age) and having some bad love experience she is also very insecure. She desperately wants to be loved and accepted by others. But feelings and emotions for her are hard to bear and she usually reacts with violence, even when liked by others. Taiga character is very good scripted and superbly voiced. It's no surprise her voice-actor Rie Kugimiya won Best Actress in the third seiyu awards for the role of Taiga Aisaka back in 2009. Taiga is a character that sticks to your mind, you cannot forget her. She levels the meaning of word Baka to new heights. So whenever you watch any anime, when some character says ""baka"", you instantly get smiles while thinking how Taiga would have said it. ""Baka Chihuaua"" or ""Baka inu"" .. and then you start laughing.

Ryuuji is Taiga's classmate. He's nice, polite, hard working. He always tries to help others, so is with Taiga with her one-sided love for some other person.
Thus he becomes friend of tsundere Taiga and slowly helps her to transform into a quite nice girl. He is very patient even when Taiga unleashing kicks ad blows on him. Because of this traits, he is a target for 2 other girls (very interesting and funny characters), which makes Taiga jealous.

Why do you have to watch Toradora!  ?
- because if you don't, you're missing it out on something very special here.
- because it is highly likely to change your life...for the better of course
- because if you don't, Taiga would probably say to you that you ""honto"" are ""baka inu"" and she will kick you and punch you.


What do you usually do when you're done  watching the Toradora series?
step #1: you say to yourself... damn, that was awesome!
step #2: after you realize there is no season 2 you get sad and angry...
step #3: you are so pissed off, you're really thinking of packing your bags and heading for Tokio to herras the Toradora producers to make season 2...but 

then you realize you don't have enough money for the trip...

What can you do if you still don't have enough of Toradora?
-you should watch the Zero no Tsukaima series and Taiga look a like Louise Françoise Le Blanc. She also has some cool ""baka inu"" quotes that will make you laugh for a while...


You ""honto"" should watch Toradora! you ""baka inu""!!!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"This is my first review so it may not be so good XD.

At first glance, Toradora may seem like any normal romance comedy anime. However, it has a combination of slice of life genre, romance and drama, not to mention its unique character personalities. 

Story: 9
The story starts off with impact, making you want to know more about the characters and how their relationships would develop. Once the story picks up pace, almost all the episode would have that slight cliffhanger and drama feeling at the ending and would make you go ""just one more episode"" until it ends. Also, the change between slice of
                  ...
life and drama throughout the series is gradual and through many different scenes, unlike most rom com animes. I personally like how the story slowly builds up its drama, switches to romantic scenes, its sudden twist at the ending but  happy and complete ending. Most people think the ending was not clear or complete but after going over it a few times, I found it to be a hint for a nice sweet ending. I would like it more if there was an OVA featuring the characters' lives afterwards though. 

Art: 8
This anime has  relatively good graphics and character design. They have a unique style to their characters' eyes and hair,  especially that ""messy"" effect done on Taiga's hair.

Sound: 8
Love the OPs and EDs. I also loved how the EDs overlap with some of the dramatic ending of the episode, kind of making you overwhelm with emotions during the last few episodes.

Characters: 9

-Takasu Ryuuji
Main character. Very unique character. Scary looks but gentle personality type. 

-Aisaka Taiga
Definitely lives up to her tsundere loli queen title. One of the best tsundere girls XD

-Kitamura Yuusaku
I don't have much to say about him XD

-Kushieda Minori
She helps make this anime livelier and adds to the slice of life with her cheerful and unique personality.

-Kawashima Ami
I'm still quite unsure about her thoughts and feelings but she isn't that much of a bitch as the story progresses. 

Enjoyment: 9
One of the best love story there is.

Overall:9 
This series is one of the best anime I've seen and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a romance comedy or romance drama. This series is also quite realistic and the perfect choice for anyone new to non-action anime or anime in general."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Romantic Comedy is always an uncertain genre for ambitious anime. Generally speaking, ""romcoms"" are enjoyed because of their absurdity and good-natured humor while somehow managing to touch on the thinest strand of deep emotion within the romantic framework of things. It's ironically frightening, really, when Toradora! provokes more than enough honest thought and sweet sentiment underneath the camouflage of supposedly whimsical comedy.

-Story- 
Outstandingly intricate, the drama is suffused with originality and ironic wit, and it can be said that it is the story that makes Toradora! shine. While the obvious romcom tropes, such as Locked in a Room, Love Letter Lunacy, and the dreaded Drama
                  ...
Bomb, are conventional, the permeating sense of disorientation and counterproduction remains pleasantly expressive. Comedy is relative to the viewers' tastes, but the shifts in pace are glaringly charming. Due to the romantic and comedic nature of the anime, predictability is relatively improbable. There is no awkward deus ex machina luxury so many other romcom anime fall back upon when the chronicling gets tough, and so Toradora! ensures a very special type of realism within the nature of comedy. The romantic element, in one of its rarest (and dare I say finest) forms, is hence born out of a carefully crafted maelstrom of natural sentiment.

-Art-
While there is nothing particularly facinating or prodigious about the artwork by itself, the appropriate expression of detail in respect to the context is satisfying. The general details and animation for characters and backgrounds are consistent, but nothing exceptional. However, the various angles within scenes hold appropriate value, and contribute well to the respective mien. The chromatic arrangement of characters seem to also provide minor aesthetic enjoyment.

-Sound-
The anime has a reasonable degree of auditory satisfaction. Voice actors were sufficient, if not suitable, for their roles, and particular OST, such as Lost My Pieces, provide applicable emotional triggers for the contextual atmosphere. The shift in OP/ED songs halfway within the anime invites the critical mood change smoothly. 

-Character-
Toradora! holds a character cast of interestingly complex personalities. Character development for the main two protagonists, Takasu Ryuji and Aisaka
Taiga, progresses at a versatile level of depth. Character interaction initially shows convenient stereotypes, such as the Misunderstood Loner, classical Tsundere, and Genki Girl: further development systematically dismantles a large component of the stereotypes, revealing distinctive rationale. The character cast is memorable, and it is probable that some degree of sympathy, if not empathy, can be concluded from the audience.

-Enjoyment-
I cannot claim that Toradora! is the best anime out there for everyone, even if enclosed within the genre of Romantic Comedy - but it is personally meaningful and freshly expressive to me. It is one of the few anime out there that, as poorly as it sounds, ""gets what love is"", applicable to romance (and I know many can/do/will disagree). It is an anime that isn't afraid to express another form of love in stark contrast to what is styled as the ideal true love only found in dreams and fantasies.

Love becomes something of a confusing, vast, overwhelming, and wondrous phenomenon - and I think that is why I enjoy Toradora!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"If anime series can be compared to culinary dishes, then Toradora is without a doubt the Green Papaya Salad of this medium. It adheres to the guidelines of its peers yet, with its unabashed creativity, it distinguishes itself from the rest of the salads (or, in Toradora’s case, the rest of the rom-com series). It’s enriched by its irresistible sweetness yet the sugary sprinkles fail to disguise its more desultory features. It’s simply overflowing with fiery passion and yet there are more than a few instances where its energy becomes excessive. The Green Papaya Salad is an acquired taste more than anything else, a dish
                  ...
that burrows it way into your heart bite by bite. Toradora is that dish.

Like most people, I regard my years in high school, my freshman year in particular, as one of the most unforgettable experiences in my entire life.I remember jeering at the B-movie flicks that my English teacher forced us to watch, I remember skipping my exams to chill at the McDonald’s down the street from the school. I remember stealing soda cans from the vendors at football games with my friends. I remember screwing around with my man Andre during our cross country practices; we intentionally ruined several drills at the JROTC camp that was near where we practiced, we tried figuring out shortcuts in our exercises, and I loved it. Nostalgia is among the most powerful emotions in the human psyche and yet this medium has struggled mightily to capture that nostalgia in its high school-oriented series. The Haruhi Suzumiya franchise attempted to express feelings of sentimentality for the pre-collegiate years but the effort fizzled out over time. Nichijou tried as well, albeit not as much as the Haruhi franchise, but ultimately it’s simply too consumed in absurdity for anyone to reminisce on their early years. Toradora, however, is the only series I’ve seen that flawlessly portrays the misty-eyed wistfulness of high school; it’s the one show that inspires pathos-filled conversations that begin with “I used to know someone in high school that was exactly like that” or “I remember when my friends and I did something like that.” Toradora’s excellence in its nostalgia factor is based on its interesting outlook on normal facets of the high school experience (like the student council), its overwhelming realism in its setting (extremely rare for mainstream anime these days) and its relatable protagonist.

Ryuuji Takasu is Toradora’s central character/narrator; he’s a likable neat freak with an apathetic worldview (think of Ryuuji as Kyon 2.0). What really defines him as a person, however, is his unwavering selflessness, and it impacts practically every action he takes throughout the series. Unfortunately, the character that most Toradora fans gravitate towards isn’t Ryuuji; not the one that receives the most depth, not the one that you’d feel any long-term sympathy towards. NO, it’s Taiga Aisaka. A mercurial midget with ratty brown hair, her screen time is consistently soured by her irritatingly entitled attitude (watching Taiga discover new ways to frustrate me inspires comparisons to Emi Yusa, a tsundere like Taiga, and her tiresome antics in The Devil is a Part-Timer). More than any other tendency, Taiga’s most unbearable trait has to be her penchant for unleashing larger-than-life temper tantrums. She enters the Rage Zone at the slightest provocation, she destroys anything or anyone that happens to be near the path of destruction, and for the most part, everyone’s okay with it because they’re afraid of her and also because…..

(wait for it)
(wait for it)

…..Taiga has daddy issues!

Look, I know that among the most appealing aspects of anime its its escapism, its deviation from realistic expectations, but at some point, we have to declare, “Enough is enough.” There have been plenty of Taigas that I’ve encountered in my academic career, plenty of self-centered prima donnas, plenty of edgy iconoclasts known for berating their peers, plenty of female students with hair-trigger tempers, and practically all of them were viewed as social outcasts; at the very least, their behavior was punished. The only just dessert that Taiga receives for her actions is a week-long suspension from school, the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Fortunately, Taiga develops into a more likable character later in the series, a more tolerable character, a more sympathetic character, but just when you think Taiga’s redeemed herself, her old ways re-emerge at the very end. Well, Taiga had potential. I’ll give her that.

As a matter of fact, Taiga’s growth is among Toradora’s greatest strengths, for this show shines as a character-centric story more than anything else. The friendships, connections, and chemistry established through the members of the cast is what Toradora is best at, especially when it involves the main characters (a group of five that includes Ryuuji and Taiga). Ami Kawashima is among the group’s members; she’s a self-deprecating cynic that utilizes an innocent facade to disguise her true nature. Like an illusion, Ami pops in and out of each scene, dropping a few snide remarks from time to time but she really knows how to make her presence felt when needed (Her dynamic with Ryuuji is one of this show’s highlights).

Yuusaku Kitamura is another member. A rather lighthearted and silly kind of guy, Kitamura is Toradora’s most reliable presence (outside of Ryuuji and Taiga, of course), the mediator of school conflicts, and the object of Taiga’s affections (Johnny Yong Bosch, Kitamura;s English VA, is someone that I’ve held reservations about before but in this role Bosch sounds like he hasn’t had this much fun since Trigun).

Although Toradora normally doesn’t do much with its supporting characters, Yasuko Takasu (Ryuuji’s mom) is a notable exception. With her adorable airheadedness, intriguing double entendres and natural charm, Yasuko establishes herself as a star in Toradora’s constellation of characters (Like Bosch, the enthusiasm in Karen Strassman’s portrayal of Yasuko is radiant).

To be honest, Yasuko would’ve been my favorite of the bunch, if not for Minori Kushieda. Minori zigs while Toradora zags. She’s a lightning bolt while everyone else is a square. She’s a Playstation 4 in a room filled with Ataris. Minori isn’t just different from the other characters; she’s universes apart from them. An absolute force of personality, her quirky mannerisms, abiding avidity, and all-around eccentricism produces an overwhelming liveliness in the scenes she appears in. Christine Marie Cabanos completely steals the show in her groundbreaking performance as Minori; her marvelous highs are energetically delivered and her soul-searing lows are beautifully presented as well. Selfless to a fault, Minori constantly sacrifices her happiness and wellbeing for the sake of those she cherishes, and later on it’s flat-out heartbreaking to witness the effect that it has on her character. Ultimately, what Toradora lacks in a respectable female lead, the show more than compensates with the rest of its cast.

Do you remember when Death Parade began airing last year and practically everyone lost their marbles on what was probably the biggest hype train of 2015? (I was admittedly a member of the Death Parade Hype Train back then) Well, one of the most talked-about aspects of the show was its soundtrack. All anyone ever discussed was how gloriously emotional it was when, really, all Death Parade’s OST possessed was one magnificent track (“Moonlit Night”) and an assembly line of subpar somber songs with a jazzy feel to them. Toradora’s soundtrack is of the same vein. Produced by Yukari Hashimoto, the songs in this series are simple, forgettable melodies that are momentarily enjoyable yet fail to fully captivate the audience. Like Death Parade, Toradora’s OST contains a masterfully moving song (“Lost my Pieces”) but other than that, it’s hardly noteworthy as a whole. In short, the music in this show has received much more praise from its fans than it warrants and the same could be said of its dramatic appeal. In most cases, the emotions of a human being are akin to combining multiple drinks at a soda dispenser. We usually feel several emotions at once. Our current mood can be normally described in multiple ways. Very rarely do we humans feel only one emotion. Very rarely does our mood morph without warning. That said, the tone, the ambience, the atmosphere in Toradora is like a TV remote. One moment is soothing calmness while seconds later reveals blood-boiling fury. There is no subtlety, no graduality, no realism in how the characters feel. To quote Drake, Toradora’s mood transitions “from 0 to 100, nigga, real quick”.

The entertainment industry, as a whole, has established a name for itself as the dwelling where strange yet wonderful occurrences happen, and one of them is something I like to call “The Leap”. “The Leap” is a somewhat rare event in which a fairly worthwhile series recognizes its shortcomings and attempts to destroy them; as a byproduct, the series undergoes a period of significant all-around improvement. Basically, by repairing its faults, a good series becomes a great one. This is “The Leap”. For Toradora, “The Leap” commenced during Kitamura’s character arc, a controversial two-episode storyline that many have complained about but it’s one I enjoyed. As Kitamura endured a rebellious phase, Toradora spared some time to include other characters into the plot, like perennial slacker Kouji Haruta and straight-laced Hisamitsu Noto. Its emotional appeal progressed into something that was authentic and meaningful, its mood transitions developing with a measure of realism. It even bothered to include a couple of excellently animated (albeit brief) school fights (For someone who once viewed them as something of a religion, this was an additional bonus). For a while, it seemed as though Toradora could do no wrong; it was invincible.

Like all good things, Toradora’s Leap, the show’s awe-inspiring run of excellence, sputtered to a stop in the penultimate episode, It’s at that point where each and every one of Toradora’s deficiencies slithered their way to the forefront: its exclusion of everyone outside of the five central characters (and eventually three out of the five as well), its subpar soundtrack, its spontaneous tonal shifts, and even Taiga’s tsundere tendencies. In the end, the only thing that Toradora’s Leap did was temporarily repair its weaknesses (It’s almost like threading the ripped sleeve of a shirt back together and then wearing that shirt every day. Eventually, that sleeve will rip again). Despite its faults and its methods of fixing them, Toradora remains a show I’d recommend. It’s mesmerizing in its portrayal of high school, efficient in constructing bonds between characters, and excellent more often than not when it comes to humor. It makes you smile with its corniness and intrigues you with its intellect. Its first OP (“Pre-Parade”) might even cause your head to bob back and forth. All in all, Toradora is hardly perfect but, for better or worse, it never fails to be interesting, just like the Green Papaya Salad."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"(2nd review :D I'll try to keep it short)

""If you trip while running down a hallway you will get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you'll cry.""
-Minorin Kushieda

~Toradora!
You have that average romantic comedy mixed with high school slice of life. ""Boy meets girl, girl meets boy.""
So far nothing that interesting, then, why is it an 9? Not a 7 or less? In my opinion, it differs in plenty of ways from the average romantic comedy and I'll try to explain why.

Story: 8/10
...
I'd compare its story to potato chips *--* 
It's kind of addictive.
You eat the first one, it's good, then you get another, and another, and another, when you realize you ate it all and sometimes wants even more. That's the feeling this show gave me.
It all starts with silly romance, turning into bittersweet love and ending with a little bit of drama. J.C.Staff managed to adapt the light novel into 25 episodes without leaving anything behind.
The plot is mainly about Ryuji and Taiga trying to find how they really feel and, what they want for their lifes. You get funny, embarassing and even more serious moments during the show.

Art: 10/10
It is not that awesome, you won't get those eye catching ""landscape visuals"" like the ones you see in ""5cent.persecond"" or ""Clannad"" neither the details like in ""K-ON"". Basically the main scenario is the school and its surroundings.
However, they focus into the characters drawing, giving them really convincing looks and expressions, something that is really important in these kind of romance/drama series. All the scenes were carefully animated.
I also enjoyed the colors and the animation they made for the 2nd OP/ED ""Silky Heart"" and ""Orange"". It matched with the tone of the music perfectly. 

OST/OP/ED: 10/10
(...)
Damn violins ~_~'
""Lost my Pieces"" ->  remember the name of this song because you'll never forget it. It may be one of the most touching I've ever listened to. The OST for this serie was so well done that even if the situation wasn't that touching, by hearing this song (along with ""Yuugure no Yakusoku"" and ""Yasashisa no Ashioto"") you'd get really depressed.
About the OP and ED, 'Pre-parade' was good for introducing the characters and all but I found 'Vanilla Salt' weird. In compensation I really liked 'Silky Heart' and 'Orange' since it followed the pace of the story. If you take a closer look, you can notice that the song summarize the events of the last episodes and show how the characters' relationships are progressing.

Characters: 10/10
Unique ones.
It's interesting because you have the characters that every high school classroom have with their own problems, but somehow they get to know each other better, and build up a friendship despite their differences. The (aparently) antisocial guy with scary looks, the hardworking class representant, the (weird) captain of the girls' softbal team, the (chibi) tsundere and (of course) the popular and beautiful transferred student (who's also a model). Mix them all and you have a interesting group.
Character development was also well done. You can notice that the OP change to 'Silky Heart' (that's much more serious) just when things gets less carefree and more tense between the characters. After ep. 18 you have more drama than comedy comparing to the first episodes. And you start to get the feeling that things are leading to an end.
I wish Ami would get more screen time... (I won't spoil here) but there was a lot more to show of her. She was put aside in the final episodes, like Kitamura (the difference is that his arc had already ended...)

Overall Enjoyment: 9/10
I bought the premium edition when it came out, and just finished rewatching it for the 3rd time. After all this time I can say: it's still exciting. Like I read in another review, it's a cute show. Relaxing to watch and heartwarming. It have its sad moments, but everything work out well in the end.
I consider it a must of the romantic comedies. Especially if you watched something like Clannad or Air that left that feeling of sadness/melancholy, Toradora! will cheer you up again.
Happy endings ftw! :3

It was longer than I expected... Hope it was helpful!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"I found this anime very bad, it's a lack of love and attention around all the characters.
For having a very positive evaluation, I decided to try it, I thought the anime would be very good, but it's very bland!
At the beginning of the story I was waiting for the anime to improve, to have a little comedy to have an interesting story, in the middle of the anime it started to improve a little, in the end I thought the ending was good but nothing very exciting, although the characters still reached the age of majority , I found them very childish.
I thought the secondary

Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"It's hard to come up with an opening sentence, I mean, this show was so unbelievably bad. It was abismal, mind-numbingly boring, fucking trash. BUT, since watching I have searched for the answer to why people like this show, and I think I've found something. Actually, no I haven't.


Characters - The characters in Toradora are either generic to the highest degree, or they're Taiga, and just might be the worst character in existence. The main characters Taiga and Ryuji have the personalities of rocks. Ryuji is an average nice guy and Taiga is an average tsundere, there is basically nothing else to these characters. I’ve
                  ...
heard some say that the characters in Toradora are rich with development but all I could see on that front was Taiga finally growing in the last 5 seconds of the show and a side character named Ami learning how to be less of a bitch. Ami’s development was decent at best spo I don’t really have complaints about it, but Taiga’s development was executed very poorly. As I said earlier, she is a tsundere, but not just any tsundere! From my experience, Taiga is the most extreme tsundere I’ve ever seen. She beats people up at every turn, and it isn’t even limited to her love interest, she is just the definition of a prick. She remains this way for 24/25 episodes and until  30 seconds near the end of the last episode, she’s finally nice. How sweet. I guess this technically counts as development, but if you want to stick with this little cunt for 24 and ¾ episodes until she actually grows, please do. Trust me, it’s not worth your time. I find it hard to believe people can actually call her cute, root for her pursuit of romance, or most importantly call her a good character. As for the other 3 characters, Kitamura, Minorin, and Ryuji, they don’t get development. I heard that Minorin does, but no one has actually bothered to explain it from the many people that I asked so I can only assume Toradora fans have no clue what they’re talking about. While we are on the topic of inorin (and Taiga as well) I just want to slide in the fact that no voice actress has made me want to mute what I’m watching aside from these two characters. I didn’t come here to hear annoying orange on helium crack some even shittier jokes than usual.

Plot - The basic plot of toradora is, just like the characters, lacking originality in every way. The 2 main characters go through the trouble of trying to get the other one laid only to realize they wanna bang each other. Everyone is constantly put into a generic and predictable high school romcom situation where basically nothing happens except for small remnants of “rElAtIoNsHiP dEvElOpMeNt”. This results in an extremely predictable storyline with little to no reason to be invested. A big example is when Taiga's dad come to town and she tries to mend her relationship with the help of Ryuji. But nothing actually happened so there was no point at all. If someone read the synopsis and saw the cover art, they’d immediately know most of what they need to do on this show and see how it would end. Don’t even get me started on the pacing holy shit. I guess if you enjoy the shitty and flat comedy then you won’t mind, but I’m not trying to wait 24 episodes to see some romance happen. I’m fine waiting to the end of a 12 episode slice of life, but 25? I can’t believe that this was green lit. This isn’t even mentioning how rushed the end was compared to everything else. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Throughout the whole show it’s just generic romcom scenarios where nothing happens. It’s as slow as a snail. Around 24 I think though, now we get going. Taiga and Ryuji finally kiss in a scene I could take about as seriously as I can take an annoying orange on helium kissing someone. Then they get married. Well that went from 0 to 100 fast. As if I already couldn’t take it seriously, now I just thought it was really, REALLY fucking stupid. Like c’mon, they had their first kiss and the natural next step isn’t a first date or maybe making it official, no it’s marriage. 

Aesthetics (art, animation, sound) - It was horrible. The OST was like everything else, generic. The animation was just bad, the art is about what you'd expect from a 2008 anime from a studio that puts out too many shows, and I think I’ve already covered the worst part of the sound, Taiga and Miorin’s voice actresses. It’s not even an exaggeration to say that I cringed when I first heard them speak, and a few times afterwards (I watched sub btw). Also the openings and endings are just utter shit. Maybe, maybe I could say that the first opening is passable but I can’t lie to myself, it’s far from it.

Enjoyment - I don’t usually cover enjoyment, but I feel like I should in this case because by the time I finished, my emotions toward this show were just so extreme. I tried to stay optimistic, I really did. I kept telling myself it will get better, as did my friend who told me to watch in the first place. Looking back I have no clue why I finished, but I did. Off of a false hope that the show would be good because, honestly, I don’t think I liked a single second of this show, EVER. What started as standard boredom turned into extreme dislike over the course of this show and it would’ve only happened sooner if I didn’t have that hope. Amongst me and my friends, this show has transcended the definition of bad and has just turned into a fucking joke. It is LITERALLY laughably bad. Like if someone called something horrible someone could say that at least it wasn’t Toradora or something like that.

I like to think that I missed something, maybe I didn’t pay enough attention and this show isn’t as bad as I think it is, but that has proven not true. I have tried to find what people like about it but all I get back is stuff like : “It gets development” then when I ask what development they never respond. Or maybe I’ll get, Taiga is cute, which I still can’t quite wrap my head around but hey, whatever floats your boat. Another one is people saying it’s funny which wouldn't even be a bad response, except that the comedy is unbelievably stale. It makes ""Friends"" look like a masterpiece. At this point I don’t think I missed anything, it’s just a shitty and extremely overrated show. In fact I’d argue the definition of. Thanks for reading! Hope this didn’t trigger anyone too badly :)

TAIGA IS THE WORST CHARACTER EVER MADE
(well unless it’s that)"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Toradora! Review:

Simplicity. Sometimes keeping things simple really makes a show something special, and that's exactly what Toradora! provides.

Story 8/10:
Like I said, Toradora is a very simple show. Being so simple, the story really isn't anything groundbreaking or unique. However, this doesn't by any means mean that it is bad. Toradora is about two students named Ryuuji and Taiga. The two each have feelings for the other's best friends. Ryuuji and Taiga spend the majority of the show trying to help each other get closer to their respective crushes. The show is primarily composed of episodes of various events that open up opportunities for Ryuuji or
                  ...
Taiga to get closer to their crush. These are very fun episodes to watch, and although episodes like these in other shows tend to lack direction, every episode in Toradora has purpose in establishing the characters and directing the show towards the closing episodes. Toradora doesn't do many unique things with it's story, but what it does dish out are well executed episodes that only strengthen the simple story that it has.

Art 7/10:
The art in this show was very good. The characters all felt unique from each other from an artistic standpoint, and the varied locations were all well animated. It's hard to describe, but the art in this show just felt unique. It is much like the show in general, where there really isn't anything crazy different about it, but it somehow stands out in the crowd.

Sound 8/10:
Music wise, the sound aspect of Toradora was great. The OPs weren't my favorite at first, but quickly grew on me. The EDs are very catchy and some of my favorites. The background music fits the tone of the show well and does nothing but help set the mood of each scene. The voice acting also did nothing to disappoint. I loved Taiga's voice acting, and although I'm no expert in the world of japanese voice acting, I must say that I really liked the characters' voices as a whole.

Character 8/10:
The reason this show shines so much is probably because of the two main characters. Ryuuji is a teenage boy who, due to his eyes, is interpreted as a mean intimidating guy. However, he is really just a kind person who likes to cook and clean ironically. Taiga is a very short teenage girl who looks cute but is actually vicious and will not hesitate to insult or even attack somebody she dislikes. The dynamic and growth that these two characters have together is truly something special and kept the show interesting at all times. The side characters on the other hand can be much weaker. The side characters for the most part lack depth and can seem extremely one dimensional or just plain poorly written in a couple cases. Minori was the exception as she actually had different sides of her on display throughout the show. All in all, the dynamic between Ryuuji and Taiga is what really helps this department shine even though the supporting cast is unimpressive.

Enjoyment 8/10:
No question I loved watching this show. It's hard to put my finger on it, but something about this show had me hooked. It was a pretty laid back high school romance with comedy sprinkled around. Most shows like this tend to lack focus and feel like a huge set of filler episodes with no particular direction. But unlike the norm, Toradora stayed focused to it's plot and continuously moved forward instead of dilly dallying with pointless episodes. The show gets you to connect with the main characters and you can really feel the emotions that they feel, whether it be happiness, confusion, or sorrow.

Recommendation:
If you are into the romance/school life genre then definitely watch this show. It really is something unique and you should at least stream it.
Stream it! +.1

Overall 7.9/10:
I know many of you will think that since I gave this a 7.9 that I should round up. But I really don't feel that it would do shows that really did get an 8 or higher justice. It would also bring up the question of whether or not I should round up shows with ratings like a 7.5 or 7.6. In my mind something like that would be outrageous because for me a 7.5 is miles away from an 8. Anyways, Toradora is a truly special anime. Its simplicity and ability to stay focused through a lighthearted story are truly impressive. The characters are very easy to relate to and there really aren't many real ""flaws"" to the show. The show is a perfect example of maximizing potential in a pretty average plot concept.

The Verdict:
Simple, yet special. Toradora is a one of a kind anime that is very hard to dislike.

Pros:
+Characters are easy to relate to
+Doesn't get off focus
+Can be very touching

Cons:
-Unimpressive side characters
-Safe plot concept 

If you liked Toradora! watch...
Golden Time:
Written by the same manga author and both have a definitely similar feel. Romance, initial love triangle, drama, and comedy.
Anohana - The Flower We Saw that Day:
Love triangles, drama, feels, and tears. Enough said.

7.9/10 - Very Good"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Toradora is probably one of the best school life, romantic comedy, drama that even those who are not a fan of the genre would enjoy.

Story:7
Toradora is about a boy named Ryuuji who looks like a delinquint, but is actually very nuturing and kind, and a girl named Taiga who looks like cute, but is actually violent and what. They both have feelings for the other's best friend and thus the story begins. 

The concept sounds generic, but the humor along with the way the writers portrayed the story, and character's made it entertaining enough that re-watching it several times fans still enjoy it.

Art:7
The art is
                  ...
strange, but at the same time portrays character's correctly. Ryuuji's eye's which are his most delinquent looking feature are at time's some what creepy, kinda Higurashi like allowing the show to easily express why people mistake his personality along with allowing viewers to easily pick up on character's emotions.

Sound:9
Toradora doesn't only have catchy opening's, and good voice actors (Queen of Tsundere!) The ost is also enjoyable. Probably the only ost I go back and listen to that doesn't have some kind of lyrics. The BGM manages to portray character's emotions whether they are having heated discussion, or having a serious depressing talk.

Characters:10
Toradora's main character's are all based on a single concept; people misunderstanding them. Since most people are misunderstood they become extremely relatable. I'm sure everyone has been judged incorrectly atleast once. Each character is complex and developed all thoughout the story giving all of them their own draw in unlike other shows where they give a character an ark then drop them off the face of the earth, or their actually not that bad and become friends with the protaginist.

Overall:9
Toradora is one of the few shows that made me shed man tears. (I can count on a single hand how many have done that.) This show will make you laugh, cry, freak out, and all of the above. Even if you don't like the genre, think it's to long, or whatever reason you have. Forget about it and watch it!"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"As I honestly think back, tears come to my eyes. Toradora! was a emotional roller coaster. This roller coaster, with its twists and turns, really made me feel that life and love is not all its cracked up to be. Maybe it was the fear of heights, or the unimaginable speed, either way, I WAS moved.

Story(10): I did not want to simply dish out 10's, but Toradora! is with ought a doubt, a ten. Toradora! is the epitome of all rom-coms, it is the great anime that inspired many others. The story is a very original and heart warming feel, you will have trouble ever
                  ...
finding an anime with a plot comparable to Toradora. If there is one anime that could even dare challenge Toradora in the love department, it would be Clannad. Toradora is one of the few animes that will physically render you speechless. It is one of the largest rides in the anime theme park. 

Art(9): Great details on characters and flawless scenery. 

Sound(10): In most anime I find myself just skipping the beginning and end credits, but not with Toradora!. The music was so perfect for the feel of the show, honestly a 10.

Characters(10): Two words, character development. Toradora! handles characters in one of the best ways I have ever seen. It is not biased with its opinions of each character, and does not fail to show details that will be used later on in the story. I honestly will not say anymore, I may begin to spoil the enjoyment of the anime.

Enjoyment(10): I honestly took my time watching Toradora!, I can compare it to the wait on the roller coaster, you slowly go up, and up, then suddenly, it all comes crashing down. This is how your emotions will be played with, you will learn to like each character, and you will learn to feel the strong emotions that come with each one of them.

Overall(9): The roller coaster has stopped, your seatbelt is unfastened and you slowly step out of the cart. As you step off, you look behind you and think to yourself ""What a ride that was, will I ever experience something so great in my life again?"" But sadly, the line to go again is extremely long, and you decide to come back another day. This line is the amount of time it will take for Japan to come out with another God-Tier anime. However long the line is, you know in the back of your head after watching what is Toradora!, that patience is a virtue, and if you wait long enough, dreams will come true. 

Thanks, if you have any questions please comment on my profile. This is a biased review, because it includes my opinions, do not take it as a viable source for information."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"I wasn't attracted to the show at the beginning like many others, but this show ends up really stirring up the memories of my own and making me feel quite related to the characters. 

I haven't cried for a show for a long time. Before this it was ""Honey and Clover II"" and ""Wolf Children"" that sincerely moved me.

My overall rating for the show is 8.5, somewhere between very good and great.

[Characters]

I'm not a super fan of any of the characters, but the anime did an excellent job making me like each one of them. The character development is pretty impressive. 

For example, I didn't
                  ...
like Ami when she first appeared. She was really a double-dealing arrogant badass girl who took advantage of her pretty face to fool the people around her and couldn't face her true self. But later she became very considerate as well as savvy, knowing how to comfort people around her when the time is right. 

Minori seemed to be a simple optimistic girl at first glance, but she actually thinks deep and sincerely cares about her best friend Taiga. In fact, the jolly girl certainly has her breakdown too, especially when she loses her favorite people, but she eventually still faces the bitterness of life with her cheerfulness. 

Kitamura, as Taiga said, is really kind. He likes Taiga and was there for her when she needs help. But he fell in love with another girl, Kanou. It was surely a shock when he finds out that girl's gonna leave the country and study abroad. He lost himself once for that, but the people who loved him brought him back. 

The series really making almost everyone has a relatively full character. Many supporting characters left a deep impression on me as well, like Ya-chan and the class-teacher Yuri. Ya-chan raised up Ryuuji all by herself after the guy left her for another woman when she was pregnant. It broke my heart to see her telling that Ryuuji that his dad died in an accident and that she will protect him so it would be fine. Yuri isn't just another single class teacher who knows nothing but complains about being single. When the class was complaining about the change of location for their travel, Yuri wrote on the blackboard that ""Not everything in life goes smoothly!"" to shut them up. It was an interesting and effective move. Indeed, ""Not everything in life goes smoothly!"" That's how the stories of every character show. That's what makes the show a more realistic story. And That's what makes me feel connected. 

Back to the main characters, Taiga and Ryuuji. 

Taiga had a hard time to feel abandoned by her parents in her luxury apartment, had a hard time to see someone she loved to love someone else, had a hard time to try to let go of someone she love to someone he likes a lot, and had a hard time to face her true feelings too. She gave me the first impression of being violently defensive, but I later find her to be quite sensitive. Other tsundere features like blushing too much when facing the boy she loves probably are just part of fan services, which I do not wish to comment on.

The show doesn't have as much to depict how Ryuuji feels; it's more about what he does. It keeps me wondering what he thinks about Taiga and Minori. If Minori hadn't kept rejecting him from the beginning, would he keep thinking Taiga as a sister, and would it end differently? But I guess love has a lot to do with timing after all. 

[Story]

I've already talked a lot about the story when I talked about the characters: it helps develop the characters well and has a realistic touch. But I'd also like to add its downside. Although the development is good for a 25 episode show, but I don't think it's a perfect story. It has the cliche part and unrealistic part too. 

Many have complained it's almost evident from the beginning that Taiga and Ryuuji would be together. True. That they'd like to get married seems too sudden. It was balanced off by Taiga's leave without ruining a good ending by bringing Taiga back at finale, but it's still pretty unexpected in a not-so-good way to hear Ryuuji say that he wants to marry Taiga not long after he decides to switch his love interest from Minori to Taiga. 

The confession of love from Kitamura to Taiga at the very beginning feels like a duh. The reason of that is very lighthearted: there's a pretty girl in the class, and he wants to begin the high school life by finding a girlfriend. Really?

Ami in the first few episodes after her debut follows some pretty girl stereotype too much, although that impression was largely wiped out later.

[Sound]

Music works well. There's a soundtrack called ""Lost my pieces"" that was used often in emotional scenes. It contributes a lot to those scenes, but it's not something impressive if you hadn't watched the show and listened to it as a stand-alone. I like it a lot though.

[Enjoyment]

I start to take the show seriously after hearing Minori's talk about horror and ghost, and implicitly about love. I'm really moved and feel deeply related at episode 16, since it's similar to my own experience in many ways and it feels so real. After that, it was a wonderful experience to see the characters I mentioned before, Taiga, Ami, Minori, Kitamura, Ya-chan...to see them going through what they go through.

                                      (5/25 eps)","Story: Yeah it is cliched, but many other anime settings are as well. The reason why I ranked it an 8 is that the way ToraDora plays with the story.

Art: Nothing extraordinary but the exaggerated facial expressions and actions really bring ToraDora to life.

Sound: Love the opening and the ending. It's pretty different from what I'm usually hearing but it has a tune and lyrics that really catch on. If I were to compare it to another opening that has the same attractiveness it would be Lucky Star. Yeah I said Lucky Star, may the angry mob read on before tearing me apart.

Character: This is
                  ...
where I laughed my hardest. The cast of characters are a good mix that work well together. They are all heavily exaggerated along with their actions, but that's what pulls this anime to the top for me. Really, can you say no to Taiga's face when she's about to cry? Or perhaps the totally strange parrot bird thing Inko who makes you bust out laughing despite it's small screen time? Minori was also pretty epic in episode 5.  

Enjoyment: An anime that can balance the cute with the comedy this well makes it a ten for me. 

Overall: I probably should have given a 9 but the energy that the characters give off just makes me jump to a 10.

ToraDora is a must see for this season's anime. Even if you don't like romance, it has romance and comedy."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Have you ever experienced an anime so much fun that you just can’t stop? This was basically my experience with Toradora . At first when I heard about it, Toradora seemed unappealing and a regular school comedy, but due to its high popularity, I decided to give it a try. I watched the first five episodes, and put it on hold because I didn’t want to get into lots of new anime at the time, but about a week after the last episode was released, I decided to get back into it, and before I knew it, I was about to enter the realm of
                  ...
addiction.

Toradora starts off with the male lead, Ryuji Takasu, who is trying to make his best effort to make himself look good for his second term of high school. Despite his caring, gentle personality, his eyes resemble as of a dragon, which is why a lot of people are afraid of him and why Ryuji is called a delinquent throughout the whole school. Ryuji then starts off his first day, happy to know his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and the girl Ryuji has a crush, Minori Kushieda, are in the same class as him, But soon enough, Ryuji accidentally bumps into the most dangerous girl in school “The Palmtop Tiger”, Taiga Aisaka. Taiga usually has a negative attitude towards others, so after meeting Ryuji her first impression of Ryuji is that she really doesn’t like him. It also turns out that they end up being in the same class as well. Later that day after Ryuji is called up to the front of the school, he finds Taiga holding onto his school bag.  He then fights for it, and endsd up getting his bag. Later at night, Ryuji figures out that the bag belongs to Yusaku, and that Taiga slipped a love leter in his bag. Taiga ends up in Ryuji’s apartment to “kill” Ryuji after him finding out about the love letter. She was able to barge in because it so turns out she lives in the rich apartment next to Ryuji’s apartment. Ryuji is able to convince Taiga to not hurt him by saying that he likes Minori. Oh, and did I ever mention Taiga and Minori are best friends? So basically they team up so they can end up with each other’s best friend. Another character that is important to the story shows up around the fifth episode, Ami Kawashima, a model that is Yusaku’s childhood friend. Ami has a liking to Ryuji, and hatred towards Taiga, so basically Toradora is a love pentagon. Pretty weird, huh? Toradora stats off sounding plain, but in later episodes it brings more uniqueness to the story, having episodes involve, Taiga VS Ami in a 50 meter relay, Taiga’s family difficulties, Christmas, and a tragic field trip in my opinion that was unforgettable. Toradora has a really strong story, and the relationships between everybody are very strong, basically all of them close friends. 

Onto the OST and VA’s. The opening, which you’ve hard at the beginning of this review, is really spunky and has a Lucky Star quality to it. The second opening is very nice as well. Unfortunately, I can’t say for the ending themes, because they don’t give me the music quality I necessarily want. The soundtrack fits the mood throughout the series, and can be pretty calming at times. And the VA’s do an especially good job portraying each character, especially Rie Kugimiya, who has played such roles as Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist, Kagura from Gintama, Mizore Shirayuki from Rosario Vampire, and Shana as Shakugan no Shana. Throughout these aspects, you can tell she did a spot-on Taiga.

The art in my opinion is absolutely flawless. Maybe it’s because I watched the episodes in high quality, but it was shining and the colors were simply beautiful. The artwork shines throughout the series. I think this is probably one of Toradora’s high points.

Now the characters. The characters in Toradora are basically a hit-or-miss. There are characters in Toradora that are praised throughout the anime community, like Taiga, but some characters are neglected throughout the anime community, like Minori. I liked the characters, but for each character there was something missing between each one. Yusaku really got annoying after the last 10 episodes, Ami was a whiny bitch throughout the series in my opinion, and what really annoyed me is that characters that are basically extras throughout Toradora get rolled as “important characters”. But even so, I do believe that three of the main protagonists, Minori, Taiga, and Ryuji, are really good characters. Minori is very thoughtful of everyone around her, and is always putting her friends before herself. Ryuji is also thoughtful of everyone making their lives enjoyable, such as Taiga and his mother Yasuko. Taiga is perhaps the best tsundere I’ve witnessed throughout the anime community. She can be stubborn to people, but when she gets to know them more as friends, she can be very kind and thoughtful towards them, and, well, beating the crap out of people when they get in her way is pretty cool, too. So the characters have strong points and weak points towards them.

So overall, Toradora was a fun experience. Do you want to know how much I enjoyed it? 11 episodes in a row without stopping, making a new record for me. Toradora has a great plot, great character design, great music and VA’s, a nice set of characters, and a nice feeling after each episode. Toradora is a great experience that I think anyone could enjoy, so I recommend it to you, and my final rating is a 9.5 out of 10."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Toradora starts out looking like any other anime. Misunderstood mean-faced guy, makes friends with what looks like a Tsundere character. I was a little apprehensive, having started this after finishing Lovely Complex-a tough act to follow. By episode 4 I was hooked.

Story : 8/10 While maybe not going along the most original of plot lines, two characters helping each other out to get the guy/girl of their dreams, eventually falling for each other, the way the story spans out is unbelievably original and quirky. It starts out strong and ends strong, but the middle for me was the golden period. I have never seen an
                  ...
anime which so skilfully draws out the characters, slowly and carefully, like a bud blooming into a flower.

Art : 9/10 To be honest, I find it rare in an anime to be brilliantly drawn, all the time. Even my all-time favourite Kare Kano has faults. In Toradora I found characters, surroundings, colours and clothing to be drawn at a excellent style, consistently. The quality never dropped or changed, and rather than being faced with what looks like entirely new characters in certain scenes because of the way they are drawn, you are left with a comfortable, familiar, and brilliantly well drawn anime.

Sound : 6 (?)/10 To be honest, I only pay attention to the soundtrack if it is very, very, VERY good. And this one, while suited to the anime, has me only remember the first opening song (trust me, when you hear it yourself, you'll understand) and a piano piece that had some discords in it. I doubt you will watch this for the soundtrack though.

Character : 10/10 This is where I could find absolutely no fault. While Taiga starts out as your average tsundere character, she becomes so much more as you learn her past and all her little quirks (I dare you NOT to cry in the Christmas episode when she runs outside to find Ryuuji). Ryuuji himself is a selfless, honest and almost naive character perfect for a male lead (his acts of kindness towards Taiga will make you wish for a guy like him).
Another thing I adored about this anime, which lent itself to me easing out my Lovely Complex addiction, was the characters weren't just 'filler' characters. They each had a purpose and role to fill, even if it was only comic relief (Haruka and the homeroom teacher - I forget her name). Kushieda, Taiga's best friend and love of Ryuuji, is a highly eccentric but utterly stuck in 'friends first, herself second', more motivated than anyone I've ever seen to do well for herself, will make you laugh and make you cry. Kitamura's appearances are excellently timed for he seems to come along just as Taiga's doting on him, but he has his own reasons for excelling at school...

Enjoyment : 10/10 I dare you NOT to enjoy this anime, so well thought out I've rewatched it many times just to laugh at certain episodes. The ending will leave you satisfied but is not contrived in the 'and they all lived happily ever after' type of way. I laughed (mostly the kind when you have to stuff your face into a pillow to stop yourself from waking anyone up) and I cried (the type when you need a bundle of tissues at the ready) throughout this anime, all of which I avidly devoured in a matter of days (to the aggrivation of my parents.)"

What I thought of this anime was that it was a waste of time. Yeah, the plot wasn't cliche and great overall. Yeah, the characters were kind of unique and well put. But then there was these characters that weren't in need of being there. Instead of developing on Taiga, Ryuuji and their best friends' relationships, they just wasted time by putting in events and characters to draw time. 20 episodes of nothing. 5 episodes equal the development and actual romance. The end was great, I guess, and when we saw them progressing on their relationship it was great. But

Story: Well, when I saw MAL rating about this anime I actually had big hope, but when I watched the 1st episode I lost my hope. The plot is about a boy and a girl which in love with each other's best friend and that made them support each other and spent time like almost all day long. From what I saw, it's too obvious that the main characters are going to end up together, especially when Ryuuji and Taiga lives next

door and even almost like livin together. That's why I said it's too obvious they'll end up together, and when I saw a character has a crush on either Ryuuji or Taiga, this things always came to my mind ""it's impossible, you got no chance with your love""

Art: In this anime this part is really bad, especially Taiga, I was hoping she will be the cute character but it never happens. Taiga's fighting scene also really bad, or maybe it's just because I just finished action anime with an epic fighting scene.

Sound: I think the sound is not that bad if you really focus on the sound, but for me the music didn't impress me, maybe because I in clannad, just by hearing the themes I can remember the scene.

Overall I didn't enjoy this anime, my only motivation to finish this is because I don't want to make a review if I haven't finish the show."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Toradora is a flawless romantic comedy anime. And is a great anime to watch for newcomers. It follows the story of Ryuuji Takasu, a high school student who has a gentle personality with a butt scary face, and Taiga Aisaka, a petite and fierce girl who is nicknamed the “Palmtop Tiger”. The two of them form an unlikely alliance to help each other with their respective crushes, who happen to be best friends with each other. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and misunderstandings that test their friendship and feelings.

The anime is well-known for its memorable characters, well aged art style, witty dialogue, and

Toradora is on of my personal favorite anime of all time. For fans of romance, comedy, and slice of life genres. It has a lot of humor, drama, and heartwarming scenes that will make you laugh, cry, and smile. It is a classic anime that deserves to be watched by anyone who enjoys a good love story."

Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"I think we all need to take a step back and realize, what Toradora! has actually done for us. That is right, it has given us pretty much the definition of a good RomCom anime. Well, at least I've gotten that out of this show. Granted, I am not much of a romantic comedy advocate but I, being the cynical person I am, have to be quite impressed by a RomCom to even call it worth my interest. Even examples of good shows in this genre usually just set of my alarm clocks for BS I don't need to watch. But that is not the
                  ...
case for Toradora! which  makes this pretty much the best anime of this genre I have watched to this day. 

The charakters' arcs are of solid pace, their motivations are pretty clear and while seeing a bit more development in the earlier episodes would have helped me to get more invested, I can assure you, that it reaches a nice conclusion in the end. But what is really surprising for a show of a genre that is otherwise drenched knee deep in cliché and annoying characters, is the multiple layers, almost every character has going for him or her. There is almost no one dimensional character in this cast, beside maybe the student council president, but her voice is sexy so I will let that slide just this once. They are all multi layered, interesting people with their own struggles and hobbies, that don't just exist to merely move the plot forward. While at first I was lead to believe that I didn't like the crush Taiga had on Kitamura for example, because I did not get, what she would see in him, I quickly came to the realization, that this was kind of intentional. 
Taiga and even Ryuuji had to slowly realize their own feelings and come to therms with themselves, rather than kissing awkwardly in the first episode and then freezing the plot for about ten others. That is the case for far too many of these kinds of shows but that and many other cliched tropes are far beneath Toradora! 

When you have to boil this review down to anything, it is this. Toradora! is above so many things in this genre, that even I, a person deeply drenched in cynicism and highly allergic to even the slightest bit of good intentions found this show to my liking. 
While still being above many of the more generic kinds of shows, it leaves many things to be desired though. But many of these problems are actually contributed to the genre itself and my personal taste, than to the show itself. It is no character study, no deeply cerebral piece of art, just something to warm my cold, frozen heart. 
There are no people acting like Uber Nutzoid Crazypants McGee, but rather tame and with that much more believable. But when you don't like RomComs even this will have a hard time convincing you. I caught myself at a weak moment liking this show, but it stuck and even now, after a while of letting it sink, I still like it. You will too, probably, maybe not, maybe you will hate it. The ending is predictable, but that is the point so there is, besides of lacking depth for certain characters, while for the most part still not being one dimensional, nothing else to fault the show for. A bit more depth to some of the cast would have been even better, but I still liked what I got. So will you love it or hate it? 

Only one way to find out, isn't there."

To be honest, I stumbled upon Toradora many times in the past and I didn't give a damn about it cuz it looked kinda childish to me, but man, how WRONG I was. Never judge a book - anime in this case - by its cover, so to speak. Let's cut to the chase and start the review.
*the review doesn't contain any spoilers, major or minor* 

Story: 10/10
At first glance, you'd
                  ...
say the story's unoriginal - highschool students who have a crush on their classmates with some comedy - a highschool romcom, in short - but it doesn't end here. I wasn't a big fan of romance cuz I've gone through many failed attempts to watch romance anime; they all turn out to be either extra mawkish, fatally boring, totally ridiculous or absolutely incoherent. Toradora is the first - and I fervently hope not the last - romance anime I watched that captivated me.
The narration itself is neither strictly linear nor episodic. Each episode is linked to the other in a smart, simple way, so once you start watching, you'll never stop.
The romance is the teasing type if you catch my drift; not the I-love-you-from-episode-one anime which almost always ends up exessively mushy, nor is it the save-a-damsel-in-distress type you find in Sword Art Online. It leaves you with that feeling when you smile by yourself like an idiot when you're thinking about someone you love, yes that one. I've had that expression on my face almost throughout the entire series.
As for the comedy, there's a lot of humor and funny moments. In fact, I'm not sure when I should laugh and when I shouldn't since the smile never leaves my face while watching the show.
It also has elements of slice of life. There's no fan service, thank God, and most importantly it ends right where it should. The ending's gonna leave you satisfied - no cliffhanger and wait-for-a-sequel crap. The bottom line, the story is epic.

Characters: 11/10
Here's where the anime shines the most. All of the characters are adorable, humorous and individually unique, especially the main ones. You can't hate anyone in the show, on the contrary. The relationship between the main characters is nice and enviable. All main characters are well developed and have their own unique personalities and stories, and you'll definitely relate and get attached to each one of them.

Animation: 10/10
The animation is superb. The characters are nice, cute and gorgeous. Their appearances very much match their personalities, and there's no stupid faces - except for the bird. Even the way the characters move, walk, laugh, everything is just awesome.

Sound: 9/10
I watched the English dubbed version. The characters have awesome voice-overs, absolutely flawless. They fit each other perfectly.
The music is nice, very suitable to the atmosphere. I liked the two opening themes, which I'd normally skip in most shows, but here I listened to them in every single episode. The only reason I'm giving it 9 out of ten is because the score's not so great to the extent that I'd add it to my tracklist, and listen to it day and night.

Enjoyment: 10/10
Oh, you're so gonna enjoy every single bit of the show, I guarantee it. Toradora is exciting in every aspect. You're gonna be engrossed in the show before you know it, time will go fast and the next thing you know, it's 5 a.m and I haven't gone to bed yet. Simply addictive. You'll get attached to the show so much so that you'll feel empty and depressed after it ends. I went on and watched the whole series all over again right after finishing it.


To sum it up, Toradora is a real masterpiece. You rarely get to see a romance anime without ridiculous humor, over-sentimental, mushy characters and a plague in anime called fan service. My view of the romance genre underwent a 180° change after watching this show. I'm gonna look for another anime like this one right after I post the review. I highly advise everyone to watch the show. It's meant for both teenage and mature audiences, so enjoy it."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Toradora! is, in my opinion, a pretty solid stab at the Shonen-Highschool-Comedy-Romance genre that breaks the mold enough to be more interesting than other entries. However, due mostly to my personal tastes, a pretty lackluster ending and what felt like a rushed final few episodes; it fails to stand out as a great overall anime, and rather just a rather good Shonen-Highschool-Comedy-Romance. But let me break it down:

~STORY~
I have a big issue with the story, one that took me until around episode 16 to really forgive - that is that it should never have started at all. I don't count anything that happens in the
                  ...
first 2 episodes to be spoilers, but others may differ so... SPOILERS I guess - Here is my issue: When a violent bitch of a girl breaks into your house and attempts to severely injure you and causes property damage because that was her first response rather than ""Hey, I put something in your bag that I wasn't supposed to, can I have it back please?"" YOU DO NOT BEFRIEND AND ULTIMATELY LOOK AFTER THAT PERSON. You should call the police instead. And look, I get it, it's a thing of the genre that Toradora! is in; that people don't react normally to crazy violence. But it caused me to stop being engaged with the anime!
But moving on - The rest of the story actually handles quite nicely, there are very few episodes that I'd consider 'wasted', rather each episode is used to reach the final goal (Unlike Nisekoi, amiright?) which is something to be admired in the genre. It helps that, save for our main protagonist, the cast aren't as dumb as a sack of bricks, which means the story can move about unhindered by needless stupidity.
However, even a great journey can be soiled by a lackluster destination, and this is where Toradora! stumbled over the finish line. First non-spoilers: To sum it up, pretty much the big emotional scene feels like it happens too suddenly (though to its credit, the show handles it well), then when the story seems like it may pay off to a satisfying conclusion, a hideous trope rears its head to create fake drama - but then almost completely undoes itself in the span of an episode with little rhyme or reason.
**SPOILERSPOILERS - Of course I'm referring to Taiga suddenly disappearing. It is hardly telegraphed, it serves no purpose except to serve up some kindergarten-style moral message (painstakingly given, mind you), it supposed to make you feel 'WHERE DID SHE GO, I WANT HER BACK' sentiment, but it invoked a ""well that was stupid and a let down"" sentiment (in me) instead. Not to mention that she appears, quite literally out of nowhere, at the very end, which desperately begs the question - WHY THE RADIO SILENCE IF YOU WERE JUST GOING TO SHOW UP ANYWAY!? Is it just to stupidly reenact a scene from at the start of the anime? What is the point? END SPOILERS**
And really, that is what bugged me about the ending - ""what is the point"", I would've been happy if it finished midway through the previous episode. ugh.

~ART~
I watched the bluray of Toradora! and there were some weird visual issues. I mean, no animation is perfect (unless it's done by ufotable anyway), but irregular proportioning and facial features being out of whack seemed to happen a fair bit more than other anime I watch. Other than that, it's just pretty standard, I guess.

~SOUND~
With the exception of one or two bits of OST, I didn't really notice or care about the Toradora soundtrack. Just more standard affair.

~CHARACTERS~
The story section made this review a bit long, so I'll try and be fast:
Ryuuji - Our main protagonist is as standard as they come. He can cook and clean, he's ""nice"" and he's thick as mud. He also has blue hair. His specialist perk is his 'scary' face. Really nothing else to say, so I won't.
Taiga - Ugh. I hate Tsunderes with no concept of self-control. It's such a tired cliche. Though, once she starts to stops being an annoyance, she actually starts to build character and become interesting. However one of her later 'developments' seems to happen way to quickly, though is still kept relatively quiet until the audience has already guessed it a thousand times over. Still, I haven't seen a pain-in-the-ass tsundere turn out so well in a long while.
Minori - Now we get to the good stuff. I actually quite enjoyed Minori, the... uh... dammit, if I talk about why she's a good character, it's spoilers! That being said, her bizarre 6th sense-type capabilities did make me roll my eyes a bit too frequently.
Ami - Apart from the whole ""protagonist made me a better person"" moment early when she is introduced, I felt like Ami was the most realistic character of the main cast. The way she interacted with the rest of the characters was actually pretty refreshing.
Yuusaku - I like him, he's great. He's quirky and silly; but also a serious-but-smiling character. There's a whole undertone of knowing more than he lets on, but doesn't try to directly interfere. I was really disappointed when he faded out near the end.
The rest - I like the teacher, she's a good laugh. The other side characters are... one dimensional, but not too disappointing. 

~ENJOYMENT~
All in all, I did enjoy Toradora! more than I had expected I would. I finished it over the course of a couple of days, and even had a couple of instances of ""just one more episode, I swear"", which is always a point in the anime's favour. However, what I found to be a disappointing ending, and my annoyance with the beginning, colours my view of the whole show probably a little bit more negatively that it probably deserves.

~OVERALL~
Although it certainly wasn't a genre I particularly enjoy, and one that is rife with cliches, I did enjoy Toradora! and found it to be a stand-out in its field. I guess it wasn't frequently recommended to me without reason. Hopefully what bugged me doesn't bug you, and you may enjoy it more that I did!

This a story school life story about a boy meet girl only with a twist. the boy has a friend which the girl likes and the girl has a friend which the boy likes, thus beginning a heartwarming epic about the lives of the boy and girl and everyone around them.

Often times people are misunderstood
                  ...
and get bad first impressions but for those who are willing to see through those misunderstandings await rewards that may be incomparable to anything else in the world. This is a main driving point for the story which will tie into the very first and last lines of this anime and after watching will leave u touched in ways your average animes cannot.

Ryuuji Takasu, an intimidating looking boy in love with Minori and whose best friend is Aisaka Taiga a short but vicious girl finds out that Taiga likes his best friend Kitamura and after a midnight assassination attempt by Taiga, works together so that their loves can be fulfilled. As the story progresses not only do they not get any progress, but they begin to realize their feelings for each other as they spent most of their time together.

Plot development and character development is ongoing and through the course of these 25 seemingly short episodes, you will find that there is absolutely no fillers and that the characters are unique, funny, and heartwarming to watch. Everyone in a sense will get their mini arcs which consist of an episode or two but the main focus as you will notice is how the feelings for Taiga change over the course of the anime. As the story progresses, you will become attached to all the characters with feelings for everyone of them for all these characters are far from being recycled material.

Plots and characters aside, Toradora also has a very catchy and addictive opening and ending tracks which are inserted perfectly to provide transitions into the start of an episode as well as transitioning into the end. Because of this, episode intros and endings are not abrupt which contributes into the overall enjoyment as well as leaving you wanting more (especially if you were watching it when it was being released weekly).

If you managed to read this far and asked yourself, ""do i want to watch this?"" my reply is that you most likely do. This story is not all about romance since it deals with family situations and that not everyone is content in life. To be more in depth, this is a more realistic romance story even if its  superficial at some points, but overall is an anime you cannot put down once you start."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Toradora is not just a romantic comedy or a comedic romance; it is both a comedy and a romance. If Toradora was simply either a romance or a comedy, I reckon it would still be pretty darn good. And that is how good i find Toradora to be.

P.S- sorry but this review is kinda long so...

Story: 10/10

The story revolves primarioy around Taiga and Ryuji. Ryuji loves Taiga's best friend and Taiga love Ryuji's best friend. And so they decide to help each other in their quest to attain the love of those who they each love. Simple right? Nope. Taiga can be described using most,
                  ...
if not all of the following words; psychotic, dangerous, insane, selfish, demanding, and brutal, despite her extremely small stature (she's only 5 foot 5 inches tall!!). On the other hand Ryuji is a kind, gentle, and caring boy whose eyes resemble those of someone who wants to hurt you and who has  a compulsive desire for everything to be orderly and hygienic. If the joining of two such personalities in the same quest of love isn't enough for you to be interested, then keep reading. Otherwise, go watch the first episode and I swear you will not be disappointed.

The first episode of Toradora is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, first episodes of any anime I've watched. It does an extremely good job of introducing your two main characters and it does so in a pretty hilarious fashion. But what I like most about this anime is that the quality of episode never really declines at all after the first one. The quality stays at a consistently high level throughout the entire anime. Eventually you meet all the other characters such as Taiga's love Yuusaku, Ryuji's love Minori, the fake face bitch Ami, and the assortment of other interesting and funny supporting characters.

What I love so much about this story is that nothing exciting really ever happens in the lives of these students compared to other anime I have watched. Toradora uses seemingly simple everyday tasks and happenings to develop each character and their respective relationships with the other characters extremely well. However, having said that, each of the main characters aside from Ryuji have their own mini story arcs, whereby each character gets a little bit more screen time than they usually do. Unlike other anime I have seen like Kanon or Clannad, each arc doesn't place a complete focus on a single character but instead includes all the other characters. On top of that each arc contributes heavily to the overall story and it makes for a much more memorable watching experience.

Now there are only two real small problems that I have with this anime and honestly, they are are really small problems so they night not affect your watching experience.

First of all, I may just sound like I'm cocky but after I had finished the first episode, I knew what the outcome of the anime would be. However having said that, I would like to quote one of the Earth Kingdom nomad performers from Avatar: The Last Airbender; ""going to a destination is not about the destination but rather about the going"". I've been waiting to apply this quote to an anime for a long time and I finally got my chance. I knew what the outcome was going to be but it in no way lowered the quality of my watching expereince. Despite knowing what was going to happen, I still loved every moment and every scene this anime had to offer me. And even when the anime had reached its brilliant conclusion, one of which I had already known, I could not prepare myself for the emotions I felt in the final episode. However, having said that, I have to say that the anime did an earn extremely good job of convincing me that the outcome I had predicted was not going to be the case and at times during the anime, my confidence in the outcome I had predicted waned quite a bit, almost to the point where I completely scrapped my idea of what was going to happen.

Secondly, *this is about the ending and despite the fact there are no spoilers I understand some people may not want to know anything about the ending so please skip this paragraph if you are on of these people* the final five or so minutes of the anime completely ripped my heart out and went on to mend it extremely quickly. After finishing Toradora, I just felt like too much was packed into the final few minutes. Despite, brilliant and emotion-evoking dialogue, I feel as though the final five minutes would've been better should there have been extra episode. Five minutes to rip out my heart and mend it just didn't seem like enough to satisfy me.

Characters - 9/10

I've already touched on the characters in the story category so I will be a bit more brief here. Every single character in this anime was unique and likeable, at least in my opinion. I've already described Taiga to you and honestly, she is the selling point for the show in the first few episodes. If you don't like girls with personalities like Taiga's, then you may not like this anime or the first few episodes may be a bit rough for you. However, as previously mentioned, I said that the character development and the development of their relationships is done extremely well in Toradora. This is particularly evident with Taiga. As the story begins to uncover the softer side of her personality and reveal more about her past, you start to see a Taiga that you may be more accustomed to.

My single flaw with the characters in this anime is Ami. I may have previously said that each character is developed extremely well and Ami is no exception. However, her screen time decreases quite a bit as the anime progresses and this disappoints me quite a bit. As a result her character development becomes stunted and she is reduced to the role of ""observer"" and occasionally she gets a few lines here and there; however many of these lines often go unheard by other characters and the final scene in which she says anything meaningful and worth contributing to the story is cut short and ultimately had no impact on me.

Art: 10/10

The art in Toradora is nothing too special... when it doesn't want to be. However, when the anime wants to display a beautiful sunset, a wintry night, or a Christmas tree that is the life of the party, this anime can be extremely beautiful.

Sound: 10/10

Don't even get started on the OSTs in Toradora. They are brilliant. The openings and closings are catchy and I honestly really like them. Toradora'so closings are some of the few closing that I ever bothered to watch more than once because I just really liked them. There is also the Christmas song performed by Taiga and Ami which I loved despite only having listened to it once.

As for background music, it does an absolutely splendid job of amplifying the moods and emotions associated with their respective scenes. I have to give special mention to the OST or OSTs which started before a comedic moment. As soon as they we started I would always have a big grin on my face, ready to start laughing when the moment came and I feel as though this had a huge impact on the fact that I actually found Toradora absolutely hilarious. Similarly, the OSTs during sad moments also amplified the feels that I felt, particularly one which I cannot really pinpoint, otherwise I would need to spoil one of the anime's greater moments. It nearly made me cry listening to it outside of the anime.

The voice acting in the dub version (which is what I watch so deal with it) was brilliant. Taiga was nailed perfectly in my opinion, especially given the fact that her character must be an absolute handful to voice act. I also want to mention Ami's voice actor who was able to switch between bitch Ami and nice Ami extremely smoothly, and Minori's voice actor who gave so much life to a character who's ideals and beliefs are bigger than life itself. There isn't much I can really say about the other voice actors. They did fine jobs in their respective roles and none of the characters ever felt bland or out of place due to their voice acting.

Enjoyment: 11/10 (rounded down to 10/10)

I've never been much of a romance or comedy type of guy, opting instead for action and adventure. But Toradora captured my imagination and my heart only a few episodes into the series, landing it a place on my top 5 favourite anime of all time, possibly even my favourite. It was a viewing experience of the highest quality and I storngly, strongly, strongly recommend this anime to just about anyone, whether they are a fan of romance and comedy or not.

I hope I helped you make a decision in whether you want to watch Toradora or not. Feedback is much appreciated!

Edits: The name of the Christmas song is Holy Night and the sad song is Lost My Pieces should you want to check them out before starting the anime."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"""If you trip while running down a hallway, you’ll get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you cry.""

After about 6 months of hearing all the constant chatter about how amazing Toradora! is, I  decide to watch it. I've seen quite a few of RomComs, such as Lovely Complex and Zero no Tsukaima, and I've been a fan of them for a while. The only problem with RomComs these days is that they either suck, or they have an unoriginal story to it. Very rarely do I find a RomCom now a days that deserves anything above an 8, and I was actually really
                  ...
happy once I started watching Toradora, 'cause this is one of the rare RomComs I was just talking about. I don't know what made me love it the most, but I can definitely say that this inparticular RomCom is one of my most favorites of all time.

To start off, I'll give you a brief idea about what the story is about. We have Takasu and Taiga, who are both known in the school as ""Dragon and Tiger"". It start's off pretty normally, Takasu has a crush on Minori, the friend of Taiga, and Taiga has a crush on Kitamura, the friend of Takasu. Once Takasu and Taiga find out they've been living right next door to eachother, they decide to help eachother out by trying to set eachother up with their friends. With that, there are many moments full of laughter, romance, heartbreak, and plain old fun. It may sound like a cliché storyline, but the way they made this anime makes it the opposite of a cliché. I was satisfied for most of the show, despite the ending being the slightest bit anti-climactic. Overall, the story was very well made, and the comedy thrown into it makes Toradora definitely worth watching.

Artwork was great. I liked how the characters were portrayed, their looks seem to fit their personalities, at least except for Takasu. You don't see many tall, scary looking guys who are obsessed with cleaning and cooking. Taiga's character was probably my favorite in terms of appearance. The fact that she can kick ass at 4'7"" is amazing. Other than her shortness, she brings this kid-like cuteness mixed in with a sexy-like cuteness... she definitely gave off some weird vibes, but I didn't care, I still loved her.

Rie Kugimiya, the goddess of Tsundere voice-acting roles! Voiced the best character in Toradora (Taiga again)! Her and her professionalism made Taiga practically perfect, and she has an amazing voice when it comes to singing as well, good Lord. Junji Majima rocked Takusu's voice as well. His calm-like personality made Takasu even more funny during comedic situations. Everyone else practically nailed their roles, the voice acting was grade A.

Taiga. Taiga is still my favorite. She made it on my ""Top 10 Female Anime Characters"" list. I don't know whether it's because I'm a fan of Tsunderes, or because she's just plain lovable, but she was my favorite character in Toradora. Her personality made it even easier for me to love her, and I'd be surprised if there were any Taiga-Haters out there, because if there were, I'd need to go slap some sense into them. Takasu was really cool, he made it onto my ""Top 10 Male Anime Characters"" list... in otherwords, there were quite a few nominees in this anime that could have made it onto my list. Takasu is like the ideal partner. Ladies who can't cook or clean, here you go, Takasu is your man. Next theirs Minori. Hyperactive and funny, but at the same time, I kept getting mad at her at some points. There wasn't anything I hated about her, it's just some moments in this anime that made me think I did. Once you watch, you'll understand. Next there's the Chihuahua (Kawashima). Snobby model/actress personality made her seem like the villain of the show. Luckily she wasn't. She actually proved herself to be one of the most reliable characters on the show, helping people with their love life and such. Finally, there's the God of Unrequited Love (AKA Kitamura). When I heard that nickname I thought, ""What the hell?"". Other then that, he seemed like a funny guy, but I did question his stripping habits in a few of the episodes. But he's the ideal best friend. Overall characters in this show were all awesome!

Enjoyed every minute of every enjoyable second. Got sad every minute of every sad second. Laughed every minute of every funny moment. This is your ideal RomCom (God, so many ""Ideals"" in this...). If you're looking for good comedy, romance, and enjoyableness... enjoyability... wait, what... anyways, look no further, Toradora is the anime for you. I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't like RomComs and are more of the action/sci-fi/thriller/whatever genre that isn't Romance or Comedy type, watch this. It'll be well worth it, I assure you."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Toradora....where do i begin. This show is easily the best anime show I've seen in a long time, and that's saying something. Everything about it is everything i like in a good romance. The story begins with Ryuuji and Taiga first meeting. let me explain them first. 

     Taiga is a rough and tuff girl who wont take and crap from anybody, she is however small so this being the fact she is called the palmtop tiger, it is also later shown that her agressiveness is due to a rough childhood. 

...
 Ryuuji on the other hand is quite a soft, though everyone is afraid of him because he resembles his dad (who I think he was supposed to be like a realy bag guy, they didn't go much in depth in that area) he is very nice, and unlike Taiga is actually kind of a pushover. Anyway back to what i was saying

     Taiga is caught by Ryuuji trying to put a love letter to kitamura in his bag, but ends up putting it in Ryuuji's bag. Ryuuji finds it and is tempted to read it, but he resists. Then Taiga rages in and attacks Ryuuji with a wooden sword. Once things have calmed down Ryuuji tells Taiga about the poems and what not he writes for Minorin. seeing that they each have simialar goals, and the fact that their love interest is the other best friend. They decide to work together and help each other in getting that person. However it is not very smooth sailing

      Taiga is very timid around kitamura so she never can really push herself to do anything that Ryuuji plans out for her. she can barely say a word to him at the beginning of the show but towards the end she is more open with him. This I think is due to the fact that she is realising that she likes Ryuuji instead, this however doesn't happen till near the end.

      Ryuuji is not near as timid around Minorin as Taiga is with kitamura, but he still mumbles his words now and then. He as well has issues with pushing himself to do what Taiga plans out for him. Toward the very end it is revealed that Minorin actually does like Ryuuji.

      Taiga and Ryuuji spend alot of time together because of the fact that Taiga lives alone. Ryuuji cooks for her just about every night. Because of this Ryuuji's mother considers Taiga part of the family.

      Later on as Taiga and Ryuuji spend more time together, (though they never say till the very end) they end up having feelings for each other. It does take a while for them to realise it, so sit tight and keep watching. because it is worth it.

      one of the best traits about Toradora is it's suspense. I don't know how they were able to put so much suspense in a drama/romance but they did. For me this show left me wondering after every episode. It made me think and want to know what was in the next episode. I had to seriously force myself away from the computer in order to stop watching it. Because after every episode you WILL want to know what happens next!!! I gaurantee it.

      Another thing about Toradora. I know in retrospect it is pretty obvious that Taiga and Ryuuji will be together, and I thought that would ruin it for me...but...it really didn't. Because though it may be obvious, it doesn't really seem sensible. It doesn't seem like they'll end up together at the beginning even though you know they will. It's crazy how this show does it but it does it excellently.

      I would recommend this show to anyone who likes drama/romance cause this show does both of those PERFECTLY!! and i don't say that lightly. The background's on the character and the storyline would have made the show good even if there was no romance. I would highly recommend this anime.

      Story (8) - I am giving this story an 8. Because though it did have interest, and left you wanting to know what happened. It is lacking in resolve. considering Taiga's family that is. At the end of the show Taiga's family is still mad at her for leaving, and they don't really resolve that. Though she does end up going back for a year.

      Art (9) - I give this show a high 9 on art. The design of the character's wasn't my favorite design, but the show still made it work out. The art was masterful in my opinion. The work of a genius.

      Sound (10) - I am giving the sound a 10 for various reasons. The emotion in this show could be felt throughout every episode. It was like you could almost feel the person's pain. even when the side character had a moment it was great. The sound is really Toradora's shining moment.

      Character (9) - I am giving character's a 9. This is the kind of show that you will definitely like all of the characters. Even if you didn't like a character from the start (for me it was Minorin) you will like them towards the end. The backgrounds on all of them are all unique and all interesting. No one's background in this show is boring.

      Enjoyment (10) - I have never watched a show that I have enjoyed more than Toradora. As i said before it will leave you in suspense after every episode. it will be 4 am in the morning and you will be finishing episode 17. It will end and you will lie their with your mouth open. Then you will scream because you want to go to bed but you don't want to stop watching it (WARNING!! if you don't like staying up really late than i would sudgest not watching Toradora at night.)

      Overall (10) - as for the overall it obviously get's a 10. Which are well earned points. This story will not dissappoint you if you like drama/romance that leave you suspenseful and wondering. Not to mention really excited at some points. P.S. Ryuuji and Taiga do kiss at the last episode. =)"

In begining, you're introduced to Ryuji, the Dragon. He is a cold fish, very intimidating and mysterious for the most of people, but, in truth, he is a nice guy, smart and gentle with everyone who wants come close to him. Kitamura Yusaku is one of this people and a very clever and
                  ...
dedicated member of the student council. He is Ryuji's best friend and Taiga's crush. Yeah, Taiga is fallen in love with him and fails miserably with her mission to send him a love card, making her enter in a peculiar situation with Ryuji, when she discovers that he's in love with her best friend, Kushieda Minori. Taiga is in love with Ryuji's best friend and Ryuji is in love with Taiga's best friend... Let's make a deal! Ryuji only imagined that it could be more easy and less exhausting, haha!

My favorite character is, with no doubt, Minori. She is so cute and adorable and charming and funny and... Aaah!!! She is perfect, hahaha!
Kawashima Ami appears a little bit late, but she's an awesome girl too, she is the truest of them all. (That's so paradoxal!) With a so much common charm, she is a gem and deserves a spotlight here.
Yusaku also is a character full of highlights, as your responsability sense and enthusiasm. He's cute, no?
But, can I be honest with you? The protagonists broke me down a little. Taiga is called by Palmtop Tiger, so you can wait a girl with much fisical strong and little mental maturity. And Ryuji accepts her rough treatment like a dog. (Jokes for after, please, rs.)
So, my grade for them is 7, my average.

Although Toradora be a 2008 production, there is an excellent work with the art and sound. The music are catchy, the characters and scenarios much well drawed, there is so much beautiful effects and the openings are simply perfects! My grade could be 10 so much easy, but the ending songs make no sense.
Yeah, it's weird. Really.

My enjoyment wasn't so high and I don't know if I'm too older for this or if for another reason. Anyway, I see Toradora as a good distraction and it has an fair enjoyment, like the grade 6 sugests.

So, overall, my grade is 7. If you are a fan of shoujos and romance, it's an anime that will not disappoint you and if you aren't, it will surprise you! Take a good look in Toradora and I hope I helped you."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Starting Toradora was kinda interesting for me, the main reason why I picked it up was that I was told through a friend that it's one of the best (if not the best) anime in its type of genre. Curious on that claim, I decided to give it a shot to see if it met my expectations.

The story itself is pretty simple and basic, taiga loves ryuuji's best friend, and vice versa for ryuuji to taiga's best friend. Both decide to help each other out in following their love's path set out for them. As the show goes on though, it becomes less about trying
                  ...
to get together with who they love, and more about understanding why they love, who they really love, what love really is. I won't lie, it's probably a really predictable story on how it ends since it certainly won't shock anyone by the ending, but the show is not about the ending; it's about the progression to that ending.

I think what stuck out to me most about toradora was its characters, and I don't mean just the main ones of taiga and ryuuji. I mean pretty much the whole cast of characters are incredibly dynamic, they change over the course of the show, learn, grow with the viewer. Even characters like the homeroom teacher and class president who don't get anywhere near as much screen time as most of the cast really do learn and evolve into better people. The character interactions are quite amazing and beautifully woven together to really show how the characters grow from each other. Nothing feels forced or nonsensical; every characters actions and emotions feels very real and relatable. For such a simple story, it really is fleshed out marvelously by these extremely dynamic characters, and really makes the viewer feel at home and engaged from beginning to end.

Toradora is definitely a show that met my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the genre it tops at. Extremely lovable and relatable characters that make a basic story turn into a highly enjoyable experience from beginning to end will make you wish the show doesn't end when it does. It's a show that more likely than not will grow on me as time goes on, maybe becoming my favorite anime of all time."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Mixed Feelings,"There are two kinds of camps I have seen when it comes to people who dislike this show. Some will watch the first couple of episodes and just find not to like it, which is somewhat understandable. But then worse fate is being part of the group who watches the show and enjoys it just to have it ruined by the ending.

In a way, I feel like alot of the people who say the ending is fine or even good are on huge doses of copium because they enjoyed the show like I did. I wont spoil it here, but trust me when I say
                  ...
it feels very dumb and not well written.

Despite that this show has a cast of likeable and unique characters, so its not the worst thing in the world. without the ending I would call this a solid 7.5/8"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"***SPOILERS N SHIT***

I'm routinely let down by poor endings. As a writer I know firsthand how difficult it is to conclude a story, particularly if you've become attached to all the characters. Do you want them to live happily ever after? Do you want to punish them for a character flaw? Do you want leave the audience guessing with an ambiguous ending so they can form their own mental picture? Or do you just fuck it all up because you clearly misjudged what drove your work in the first place.

That last one isn't a question because it's how Toradora!!!!!111! decided to do things. The writers
                  ...
took generic characters, gave them enough personalities and quirks to keep even someone like me--who is not a fan of romcoms in the slightest--invested in the outcome, and weaved a clever up-and-down rollercoaster of emotions. The best part was that the ride transcended its high school setting and never seem tied to ""teenage years"" melodrama.

Well, until the last few episodes. Running away from home? Eloping? Enabling friends? Conveniently-away roommates/family? Convenient loving grandparents? Convenient unconcerned friends/parents/school officials/thefuckingpolice? Well, I could deal with all that. I was even considering this a 9/10 despite all that stupid crap because of how invested I was. And then the final episode rolled around.

I barely have the heart to talk about it. I could not be more frustrated. She expects him to just wait around while she selfishly runs away ""to deal with her own problems and become a stronger waman"" like a complete idiot? For various reasons I've seen more than my share of romcoms and this plot thread is repeated so often it's an actual cliche. And guess what? IT NEVER WORKS. It's ALWAYS stupid. It would have been better if the protagonist had broken his neck falling from the bridge, because at least that's interesting.

Oh, what could have been. Just like dating whores in high school instead of forging meaningful friendships, watching this anime was a mistake that I will regret. Mostly because of how good it should have been if the writers had been great instead of good.

On to the next disappointing anime.

PS. I really liked all the characters here, so if you're into that sort of thing it's still worth a watch. But if you want a satisfying ending that flows with the rest of the series just give up before you start."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Just so you know I read the light novels (10 volumes), so I have more or less a point of comparison and reference.

Let me tell you how good it is. First 2 episodes ended me up watching the whole series in 2 sittings (12 or 13 eps/day, which is very abnormal IMO) and ended up rewatching 2 more times and reading the novel in a span of 2months.

Toradora. Most people have no idea what the title means. Neither did I when I saw this the first time. I assumed it was some typical rom-com story of unrequited love. And yes, it's exactly like that in
                  ...
the first episodes. 

However, as the story and characters began to develop, it presents something deeper than just simple romance. Cherishing friendship, staying  in ""comfort zones,"" letting go, et cetera. It doesn't focus on the shallow side of romance. And that's what sets it apart from other anime of same genre.

One very strong point: character development.

One weakness: it was rushed towards the end. The anime somewhat drifted from the novel in around ep 22+ (i think). So I recommend reading the novel at least from V7 onwards (better if you read from the start, of course).

Nevertheless, the anime is very very good and is recommended to everyone."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Keeping a story interesting through a 25 episode series is a hard thing to do and you must always make sure that your not too repetitive with the stories. This anime does a great job in doing this and i never thought I'd enjoy it. I first saw this anime on a top 10 romance video and it took me 6 months to actually get around to it because i don't like romance between a short and a tall character. Before i watched the anime i didn't even have an open mind, i was 75% sure i was going to hate it and i have
                  ...
got to say that this anime was unexpectedly enjoyable. I loved the concept of the tiger and the dragon and how they were the perfect match for each other. I just loved both of their relationship throughout the series. Every time their friends would face a conflict and i was interested in almost all of their stories. I also liked how unique of a male character Ryuuji was. Some of Ryuuji's qualities were adapted from other regular main characters but most of them were quite unique. This might sound great and all but their was a bit of failure when it came to Ami's character. Ami caught my attention at first but after a while her story kinda grew old and she never really solved her problem. I never even understood what she was thinking. Her character was confusing and it hurt my head a little. The next issue is more of a personal taste rather than an issue. Tragic romance has always made me cry and i never really had a problem with it but the ending was really something i didn't get. Yeah i get that love is confusing and all but if Tiga's Decision still baffles me to this moment. If she had died or was forced to move i would have understood but her decision was like taking a poo on all the build up and hard work. Over all i think that this anime was very good and i hope that it was definitely a must watch anime"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I came into Toradora! excited. I heard so much hype for it over the years and I’m a huge fan of tsundere characters of which Taiga is the poster child. So, why not? 

However, from the very first episode I could tell: Toradora! isn’t really anything special. Perhaps the series was groundbreaking when it was first released, but I failed to see what was so amazing about it. Sure, I had a few chuckles here and there, and certain scenes (ski-trip incident, Taiga’s mental breakdown about losing Ryuuji, and a few others) were pretty great, but I definitely wouldn’t consider this anime a masterpiece. 

Now,
                  ...
I may sound like I’m just trash-talking this series, but there were some pretty decent points, too. I’ll go through each category one by one and explain both the positives and negatives I found.

Story: 

5.5/10 — Ryuuji Takasu, a 2nd year high-school student who is often feared for his scary-looking face, meets Taiga Aisaka— the school’s most feared girl. After discovering that Taiga has a crush on his best friend (Kitamura) and that he has a crush on hers (Minori), the two join forces in an attempt to play matchmaker for one another. The story follows their attempts at getting their friends to fall for each other, but in the end, it’s Ryuuji and Taiga that end up getting together. 

Let’s face it, Toradora! had a very basic storyline. While I admit the plot of having the MCs play matchmaker was new, the majority of Toradora! was your basic slice-of-life/high school storyline. I enjoyed the class trip, the pool “arc” and other typical high school activities since I’m a fan of the slice of life genre, but what bothered me was the overall pacing of the story. There were far too many episodes and not enough entertaining content to fill them. Certain problems were drawn out unnecessarily (i.e.: Ryuuji trying to confess to Minori) that dampened the show to boring at times. Other times (particularly the first episode) the scenes cut through quickly and weren’t even given proper conclusions. One example of this was in the first half of episode 1 when Ryuuji literally bumps into Taiga for the first time. Taking offense, Taiga punches him. 

…And that’s it. 

Ryuuji moves on as if getting punched in the face is an everyday occurrence. It doesn’t show him angered, saddened, even bothered by the fact that he got socked in the face for no apparent reason by a stranger. He just rolls with it, because, hey, why not? On top of that, the next time he meets with her, he has nothing to say about being punched. He doesn’t confront her or complain about it. He has no reaction; he just moves on. Normal humans don't do that. 

Skipping ahead, I also find it worthy to add my feelings about Ryuuji and Taiga as a couple. Though I understand the build-up for Taiga's feelings toward Ryuuji, I can't quite understand why Ryuuji liked Taiga in return. The anime made it seem as if, once he figured out Taiga had feelings for him, he decided to like her, too, just because. Taiga falling in love with Ryuuji made sense because he was a generally kind person that helped her through thick and thin. In fact, the majority of the series is spent with Ryuuji trying to help Taiga win Kitamura over. Ryuuji, on the other hand, didn't have the same luxury from Taiga. There were only about a handful of scenes where Taiga honestly tried to help Ryuuji get together with Minori. This, in the end, made Ryuuji's love feel forced, considering that he didn't really have any reason to like Taiga. Instead, it seemed as if he just got used to her being around. 


Characters:

8/10 — Definitely strong and entertaining, this is probably where Toradora! shone the brightest. I found Minori and Ami the strongest of all the cast with special emphasis on the former. Though Minori was presented as an oddball character, she succeeded where other whacky anime characters fail– she had substance. There was meaning behind her odd behavior and even slight hints at a deeper layer that I wish could have been explored more. Ami, though depicted as a spoiled, self-absorbed girl, seemed to undergo an entertaining personality change that was subtle enough to be believable and flawlessly executed. Kitamura, though a kind and chuckle-worthy character wasn’t particularly notable, and the same can be said (but to a lesser degree) about Taiga and Ryuuji— the main characters. Ryuuji is another likable character that makes you root for him, though nothing about him particularly stands out. He’s introduced as a character that scares most of his peers due to his fearsome appearance, but this detail was barely touched upon. In the end, I felt Ryuuji was a flat character— kind, a little snarky at times, and a cleaning-fanatic, but hardly worthy of becoming anybody’s favorite character. As for Taiga, I personally liked her quick tongue when it came to battling Ami’s jeers and her dynamically fearless spirit, though, at times her attitude was a little annoying. There were also times where I was a bit confused because her actions clashed with her personality. For example, though she and Ami seemed to fight and bicker constantly, they decide (without any build-up) to sing a cheerful and festive Christmas song together on stage at a class party because… why not? Perhaps there was a love-hate relationship that built overtime between the two, but I didn’t feel as if it was executed in a subtle yet comprehendible way. 

All and all, everyone was fairly likable and pulled off the series very nicely.


Art / Sound: 

5.5/10 — I don’t have much to say about the art and sound since I don’t often focus a whole lot of time on them with anime. But for the sake of the review, I’ll leave my two cents. The art is decent. I wouldn’t say it’s particularly beautiful, but it wasn’t bad, either. It gets the job done. As for the sound, I felt the first opening didn’t really fit the show. It wasn’t because it was a bad song, but I just felt that its techno-y sound clashed with the series’ genre. As for the other songs, I admit that I didn’t give them much of a listen with the exception of the second ending, “Orange” (a song that I rather enjoyed and found very catchy). 

In terms of the voices, everyone did a decent job and I have no real complaints about it. The only exception to this is Taiga who was voiced by Rie Kugimiya in the Japanese version. Having watched Gintama (another anime where Kugimiya plays the main female heroine ‘Kagura’) before Toradora! I kept getting a “Kagura” vibe. There were times when she sounded decent for Taiga, but when her pitch changed, I just kept picturing Kagura. Kagura has such a vastly different personality from Taiga’s, so to keep picturing her, I couldn’t help but feel a bit irritated. This is just my personal opinion and I’m simply including this tidbit because it did have an affect on my enjoyment. Her voice, to me, just didn’t feel right at some points.


Enjoyment/Conclusion: 

7/10 — Toradora! is a decent anime if you want to pass the time. It does have its excellent points as well as its weak ones. I found myself bored by a few of the center episodes, but the anime as a whole is marathon-able. If I had to give it a grade, it would get a B-. I’m honestly a little confused as to why this anime is hyped about and given as much praise as it has received over the years.  However, I’m not above recommending it to anyone that wants a satisfactory romance story with great slice of life elements."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"Oh boy, where do I start! Toradora is usually one of those shows that everyone recommends as a great slice of life, romantic comedy anime, and I do enjoy a good romance story, but I do not understand why people enjoy this show at all. 

To begin with, I honestly find the art to be inoffensive and bland. Besides Taiga, Ryuuji, and maybe a few others, I just find the character designs are just forgettable. The students finding Yusaku incredibly handsome is still a mystery to this date. If you find the art to be decent or good, I would not blame you at all.
                  ...


As for the characters, I find them extremely, extremely, extremely unlikeable. Characters like Ami, Minori, Yusaku, Yasuko (especially you), and most importantly Taiga. I can probably explain opinions for all the characters I find insufferable, but I will just explain my hatred for Taiga. The overall writing and characterization of these characters actively wanted me to continue hating them and/or feel nothing. The anime community's love for Taiga makes me wonder if I even watched the same show. I am usually fond of tsunderes simply because they tend to be some of the most complex, sympathetic, and well-written characters of a show. A lot of the actions Taiga is just simply inexcusable; I know this is just anime, but I am having a hard time keeping my suspension of disbelief. Like how can you honestly constantly physically and verbally abusive someone for cares take for you for free? It is not cutesy or funny; it is infuriating!!! I know she does develop in the later episodes, but I still find her to be incredibly annoying. 

As for the story, there is not much, but that's fine for this setting. 

One redeeming factor would at least be the soundtrack. It is overall pretty good, and the OPs and EDs are great! 

Overall, I found the show to be extremely unlikable with its lackluster writing, characters, and art. If you want to watch a show with some complex and likable characters with actual good writing in a rom-com High School setting, watch Oregairu."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"[Story: 8.0] Toradora is, dare I say, undisputedly one of the most popular series of 2008. And it's not hard to see why, provided one watches past the initial episodes of misunderstandings, love triangles and such, that is. Because although Toradora began with plenty of elements common in its genre, it ended off as more than just a typical romance comedy. The series isn't just about romance, as it deals with relationships not limited to the typical love scenarios and gimmicks prevalent in most school-life shows. There isn't much to really comment on the story, as the plot itself is rather straightforward and simplistic.

I personally
                  ...
also like the use of a bookend (or framing device), such as how the way the show started mirrors how it concluded; it may be a minor thing, but it does contribute to the overall feel of the series, in that it helped in creating the mood of a finale with proper resolutions. And it's an excellent resolution as well and I like the dialogue being echoed at the end - if there’s anything I've got to complain, it would be that I didn't get the ending that I wanted. I was shipping Ryuuji and Minorin (despite the very obvious series title).

[Characters: 9.0] What's enthralling about Toradora is none other than its cast, each of who has their own distinct personalities that are well explored during the course of the series. Without a doubt, the cast is astonishing, growing (and shedding) past their archetypes and are shown as individuals with depth. For a start, there's Minorin: beneath the eccentric and ever-energetic persona, is a girl with a surprisingly complex emotion and disposition - something one doesn't usually associate with the genki girl archetype. Similarly, despite the initial setting of Ami being the school idol with a snarky attitude, she was gradually portrayed as not only sympathetic, but can be quite a good friend as well. Even Kitamura has his own share of drama to deal with, showing that indeed, being the vice-president of the student council and class representative isn’t a ticket to being infallible after all (breaking quite a few anime conventions in the process).

Most notable of course, is none other than the titular pair of protagonists. Ryuuji, being a nice guy deep down, whose main quirk is being someone with an obsession for cleaning and housework in general, creates an interesting contrast with Taiga's brash and clumsy actions. Some of the interactions those two had in the later part of the series can be both poignant and heartwarming. Overall, their actions and how they open up to their friends are what determined the dynamics of the show.

[Art: 9.0] Toradora, despite being a romance comedy, actually had better animation quality than a certain Fantasy series also made by JC Staff and released also in the same year. Now that's saying a lot for both shows. As a compliment to the studio, Toradora's art quality is fantastic. Apart from the great character designs, much effort is evident in things such as the subtle twitch in facial expressions, the gestures and fluid movements, which are all very well done. These are made all the more pertinent in the later part of the series when it’s more drama-heavy, thus aids in amplifying the mood of the series. For example, refer to the scene between Taiga and Sumire - that alone is a testament to the studio’s success.

[Music: 9.0] The theme songs are all fantastic, with the two OPs, Pre-Parade and Silky Heart being very catchy and addictive, making good use of not just their voice-acting skills, but also as singers. The bgm isn't anything impressive, but they suit the series just as well and the choice of tracks is fine too.

[Summary] With a cast of endearing characters and a nice blend of humor and drama, Toradora is certainly entertaining and worthy of its hype. It may not offer anything new to the genre, but it does it well. High re-watch value, too.
Personal Overall Rating: 9.0"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"The anime's surroundings are based around high school, just like in the most japanese animes about romance. Although, all have those specific unique aspects, that other don't.

At first, watching first episode, I was about like ""I've seen similar somewhere. I'm quite sorry for Ruuji, must hurt"" and so on. Basicaly, It just didn't grab me.
As I was watching further, the character development actually grabbed me a lot. You see, the facial expresions for every moment, word, are pretty accurate. As well as we don't get those big faces with extra eyes for special expression, which makes it quite pretty more realistic. After all, words ain't
                  ...
everything, actions speak louder.

We see how characters develop in rather a bit unexpected way. All of the characters we see there bump into specific troubles and we slowly find out who they really are, showing you that first impression isn't really everything.

I myself honestly like a lot all the opening themes. First one being quite energetic, second rather more serious, but still, it fits the story well.

Character voicing was quite awesomely done, I was all grabbed in, looking for all expressions, tone of voice everywhere and I just enjoyed it a lot.

I agree with previous previews, it has flaws, nothing's perfect. But, this is a rather unique romance anime, that I don't mind rewatching and definitely recommend to everybody that likes romance and wants to understand emotions better, after all, there's some true knowledge in it, that helps in real life.

Overall rating 10/10, because it gave me a lot of precious knowledge, enjoyment, emotional understanding and a way how to use my free time =)"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Great story, poorly executed at times. 

Characters were very well-developed, but it felt like watching a mystery anime, not a rom-com. Since the viewer learns things mostly from Ryuji's point of view, the viewer is clueless half of the time, forced to guess what the hell is happening 80% of the time. The more serious, revealing moments were not very well-explained, either, forcing the viewer to fill in various blanks with assumptions at best.

The series had a lot of potential and a great concept, but it was simply not straightforward enough, making it both an enjoyable yet frustrating watch."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"TORADORA REVIEW

Toradora is a romantic comedy drama series. The story centres round Taiga Aisaka and Ryūji Takasu as they pursue their love interests, which just happen to be each others best friend. Ryūji helps look after Taiga, taking on the role of her absent father. Throughout the series he tries to tame the Palmtop Tiger(Taiga's nickname) whilst attempting to set her up with his best friend Yūsaku Kitamura. Taiga tries to help Ryūji overcome his shyness to Minori Kushieda. She initially treats Ryūji like her 'dog' and constantly demands he obey her. But as the series continues she begins to rely as Ryūji as both
                  ...
a fatherly figure and a friend. The series tells a very refreshing tale that true love is always closer than you think. I loved the art style, it was simplistic and bright but didn't come across as generic as most of the art styles that make up this highly popular genre. The 4 Opening and Endings where top notch too however I must say the second opening didn't pull me in as well as the previous one. The characters are a stand  out. It has quite a small cast for this genre of anime. But it soon proves you don't always need a huge cast *Lucky Star, cough*. The main protagonists are so different in contrast other rom/com anime but they manage to pull it off in a remarkably, refreshing fashion.  They are very well developed and you will(unless you're dead inside) get very attached to them. Taiga is one of the strongest female leads in an anime. She can have you in tears of joy and laughter but she can drag you into tears of sadness and pity in the blink of an eye. There is one scene in particular had me in a 'awww she's so cute,' mood but i suddenly felt so sad and sorry for her very quickly. Ryuji like Taiga is very well developed. He is a very caring and gentle character. As the main lead he is very good but does lack a but of personality. But the relationship he maintains throughout the series to both Taiga and his often tipsy single mom Yasuko Takasu, as the role of the father is a emotional and often heartbreaking one. This is by far the strongest aspect of the series. The love interests Kitamura and Minori are very likeable too. Kitamura is a strong and selfless character. He suffers from Ryuji's case of a slight lack of personality but he plays the role of the popular classmate well. Minori is far stronger as a side character. She is an extremely deep and complex character and it will take you right up until the end to fully understand her true feelings and personality. She is the highest point of comedy and WTF? moments in the series but pulls it off brilliantly without coming off cheesy and lame. Ami Kawashima is the fifth and final main character. She is a model and a childhood friend of Kitamura. She initially appears to fit the spoilt, man eating tag well. But as the story progresses, much like the rest of the cast her personality evens out and she becomes much more likeable and down to earth. And this is what the series nails completely: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Bleach and Naruto need to take note on this extremely well developed small cast of characters. The story was at the outset easy to predict but it begins to throw you off course and builds to the point where you are so caught up in it you won't realise it's over until it's over. That for me was my smallest complaint. The final arc seems to stumble under the enormous emotional build-up. It pulls it off very well but it felt a tiny bit rushed. However I loved the ending, one of the most satisfying anime endings you will ever find.

VERDICT
Probably the best romantic comedy anime I have ever seen. Great characters, great story. The emotional depth and build-up is of the highest order. Just a fabulous anime. I foolishly dropped round episode 3. BUT STICK WITH IT!!!! Around episode 6 you'll be pulled into the dramatic story. So please watch it and enjoy the well crafted plot and wonderful cast of interesting characters."

""Love is something that's bittersweet"" 

I know quoting lines from the show is a ridiculously cliche way to start a review, but bear with me. If it works it works. 

That's kind of the special thing about Toradora, if it works, and it does, it works. There can be cliches, tropes, and some pretty ""anime"" things in it, but if it works, it works. 

This may be my first Japanese Rom-Com, but I feel like once I see one, I've seen them all. Maybe its because a lot of these cliche's are almost cliche to complain about. Or maybe its because a lot of them
                  ...
are shared with their western counterparts. Whatever it is, Toradora is both something I feel like i've seen before, but not in a bad way. 

...

I'll be splitting this review up in two sections. Much like this show, i'm going to keep it simple. Pros and Cons.

PROS: 


One thing that I've noticed very quickly is the astounding work by Studio J.C Staff. Their effort to bring the characters to life is inspiring. The animation is vivid, frantic, and colorful. The last thing I was expecting is exemplary animation in a shounen, a genre that's become synonymous with slow-panning still-images. 

Its so nice to see movement happen almost constantly on screen. I see characters have a lot of personality in their movements, their glances, their smiles, and their frowns. I can't reiterate how nice this is. It gives the show an immediately appealing vibe. I don't feel like i'm watching someone flip pages of a manga in front of me, occasionally shaking the pages to create a sense of urgency.

Instead, I get an environment that's instantly like-able. Characters are easier to distinguish and remember when each one has their own unique way of... oh I don't know, greeting one another. Needless to say, J.C Staff outdid themselves with the animation, even if the art design was flawed. More on that in the Cons section. 

...



The sound was also good. While not as great as the art, the opening themes were catchy and actually had lyrics that correlated with the actual show. I prefer this infinitely to some stupid self-righteous and vague intros that I see so often in Shounen anime. 

For example, I decided to look up the lyrics to one of the few Fate/Zero intros : 

                      ""My feet I moved in are 
                 Softly healed by my faraway ideals. 
     I grip tightly onto these certain bonds and move ahead, no matter where, 
             The miracle that cut through the impurity on my back.""

What. 

Or : 

                    ""In actuality, everyone wants to be saved, 
                 And their wandering hearts pierce a hole in the sky.""

What does that even mean?! 

What Toradora does above other Shounen is actually semi-creatively make the intros ABOUT the show. In fact, the line I started the review with is from the opening theme. They're catchy and set the tone pretty well. Especially the one in the second half of the show, delivering a slightly more emotional opening. 

...



While the characters are either unmemorable or simply established (more on this in the Cons section), there is one character that absolutely shattered my expectations going into the show. She did this for a specific few reasons that I had a lot of trouble coming to terms with. 

Taiga. 

Mind you, i'm not one of those ""see a cute girl and absolutely fawn-over her"" types. In fact, I value myself as a steel-heart-having emotional brick wall that doesn't get phased or distracted by some meddling anime character. And while I may sound like a Scooby-Doo villain, I promise this has always been what i've been like with television. 

In fact, when Taiga, our main girl protagonist first made her appearance, I hated her. Not the ""oh gosh golly she's annoying"" kind of hate, either. The ""Man, are there any freight trains around the area that can do me the great favor of derailing and crushing this self-righteous asshole?!""- Kind of hate. 

I despised her. Everything about her was almost irredeemably bad. And for every ounce of perfection the main character dripped, what with his cooking skills, fatherly nature, kindness, etc. It seems like the writers packed every negative trait into this tsundere Loli. 

But man, did she ever grow on me. Maybe its the icy cages around my heart beginning to slowly melt with old age. Or maybe its the fact that the writers and animators of the show tactically created this hobbit-sized doll. This is what i'll be attempting to explain. 

As a person, I think that liking someone as a character because their cute is a very shallow way to go about this. Especially for someone like me who's a hard ass and a very rough critic of everything. Its just shallow and lame to be like, ""Well, she's a horrible person... but look at those cute little blushes!"" 

But that's kinda where the show's creative team excelled at. Since this show is aggressively for men, in my opinion (I'll get into this in my Cons), our inherent fatherly instinct gets triggered whenever we see someone like this. 

She's painted as a hopeless, lonely, angry, unknowing, and arrogant little girl and we want nothing less than to help her find her way. It feels shallow, but its a very smart move by the creators. They made her short, and by that I mean REALLY short. I wanted to look this up and apparently there are actual metrics for anime characters. They say she's exactly four feet and nine inches. That's TINY! 

Not only is she short, she's also very small. She encompasses a small space. I don't even mean height-wise. The first real time we see her in a non-aggressive light is her rolling out of a thin locker. 

She is also often shown hiding her face, which is another sign of ""weakness"". And by weakness I mean the kind that you see in a tiny little kitten on the road. 

Again, a very tactical move by the staff and i'm assuming the actual Light Novel writer who made these characters in the first place. She's utterly perfect for this kind of role and while I feel shallow saying this, I found myself totally in love with her character by the end of the series. 

For someone like me, this is an amazing transition, since i'm usually really petty with these kinds of things. If I start out hating something, its really hard to win me over! But Taiga is absolutely adorable and an awesome example of character design done perfectly! 

I wish the same could be said about literally any other character in the show, but one is enough. I'll take it. I'll take this. 

Her story has a nice progression to it too. By the end of the series you feel like you are still watching the same character, but a more developed version... which is the mark of solid character development. 

By the time she really becomes more sincere and not-constantly-angry, chances are, you'll already be into her story. So if there's one thing elevating the ""character"" portion of the review to ""above average"" and not just ""average"" its this adorable plucky tsundere, Taiga. 

...



This leads me to my shortest point. In a romantic show, inevitably, there will be cliche romantic scenes. Things like the ""initial breakthrough"" when a tough-on-the-outside-but-creamy-on-the-inside character finally breaks down. Or the ""main character has dramatic realization about something to do with romantic shit"" cliche. There are a lot. 

Toradora does them all. But for the most part, they're done well. Especially an earlier scene in the show that was one of the most heartbreaking emotional explosions I've seen in anime. 

...



Lastly, the story in Toradora is literally nothing special. But that's what makes a lot of it so deftly done. It baths in Rom-Com cliches from head to toes, but it does them (mostly) in a pretty solid way. 

I never found myself actually groaning at much of these cliches being done. Believe it or not, that's an achievement. In a genre that's plagued with unoriginal and hack writing, relying solely on cliches to tell a story... its really nice to see a show take these cliches and if not go somewhere else with them, at least do them in a way that isn't abrasive as hell. 

That deserves a mention in the Pros section. A cliche romantic comedy that actually feels nice and solidly crafted... for the most part. 


_________________________________________

CONS: 


At its very core, there are three major flaws in the show. Three things that brought this show down a solid point. For this section, i'll be separating them into three parts. 

...
Guy Characters


1.) Comedy 


This is something I have to inevitably bring up. As much as I hate it, this is a romantic comedy. Comedy is in the genre title. Its something that's inherently a part of the show so as someone who is resigned to review the show, I have to bring this aspect of it under the microscope. 

Bluntly, this show isn't funny. Its not offensively NOT funny like a lot of anime i've seen ... looking at you FMA! But I can count on one hand the parts of this show that got anything more than a slow exhale out of my nostrils. 

A lot of anime, especially Shounen anime, has this overdone comedy elements to it where every joke has to be rubbed in your face. As if you are too stupid to get subtlety so they have to yell the joke really loudly to make sure you get it. 

I don't find this funny so I didn't really find this show all too funny. Some of the comedy elements thankfully had a bit more heart to them which made them cute, if anything. Of course this mostly has to do with Taiga, who, as I've said in the Pros section, carries this show on her little butterfly back. 

But unfortunately ""cute"" and ""heart-having"" aren't two things that make a show funny. So unfortunately, this has to be a negative. While it isn't huge and by no means show ruining, if you are like me and dislike very ""in your face"" comedy, then I doubt you'll laugh at this show too much.

More so than not, I found myself grinning with certain characters, which honestly is better than a lot of Romantic comedies can make me do. But still, not even close to the standard that needs to be set. 

...


2.) Anime Ways 


This is an inevitable continuation of my criticism above. Unfortunately, overdone comedy isn't the only thing that I get frustrated at with anime, especially Shounen shows. 

Just like with their lack of comedic subtlety, I find that a lot of anime has a problem with doing dramatic subtlety too. While this isn't as big of an issue as the comedy not landing, a few scenes in the show that were made to have a huge emotional punch didn't land due to them being too hammy.

One scene which book ended an arc in particular was so jarringly stupid and out of nowhere that it honestly ruined any emotion I had stirring inside me. This cliche culture festival arc itself was never the most interesting, but its inability to stick the landing made it one of the more negative aspects of the show. It felt like the show spinning its wheels. 

Another scene where a character comes to a realization regarding their love with another character is initially done with tact, but a very obvious monologue in the middle of their dramatic and emotionally powerful realization makes the scene land slightly tilted. Whilst it isn't nearly as bad as the missed landing with the culture festival arc, its still jarring enough for me to wish that they went for a more subtle approach to storytelling that maybe, just maybe, could've gotten me a little misty eyed. 

Monologues have always been an aspect of anime. This is because Light Novel adaptations have to include the characters thoughts, which are so prevalent in novels. I get that. But certain scenes just don't translate into a visual medium that well if the studio and writers don't put the effort into altering them to become more applicable to said medium. 

Not only that, there's also a glaring issue with character design. While Taiga is universally an a amazingly designed character, there is literally nothing after that. Every other character is just generic. The best thing I can say is that their hair color matches their personality. Minorin is spunky red. Ryuuji is stern and collected blue. And Kitamura is dull-as-fuck black. 

A hilariously dumb occurrence in this show is when the characters praise the class model, Ami's, body. She's a model, so clearly she has to be fit and gorgeous! Yet the shows character design doesn't reflect that at ALL! Every girl character that isn't Taiga looks like they have the same body as one another! Its hilarious but unfortunately a complete flaw in the shows character design.

And this flaw is something that I see constantly in anime. 

...


3.) Guy Characters 



Look. I can go on about how Minorin feels tacked onto scenes half the time. I can go on about how her presence often feels disruptive due to her very unbelievable eccentricity. I can make this the focal point of this third, and final, section. But no. Although she is generally pretty unbearable as a presence, she is FAR from the worst offender. 


Guy characters in this show is what keep it from being a great romantic comedy. Its Shounen guys-appeal roots keep it from maintaining themes that its been building the foundation of the show with. 

This sucks. In all honesty, it really sucks. This sucks because many times I felt like Taiga was too good and likable of a character to be placed into such a shallow love triangle. I actually felt sorry for a character on the META level. Yes, I am a douche bag, nice to meet you. 


Ryuuji Takasa, our protagonist, is a nice, awesome, likable, good-food-cooking, strong, fatherly, friend-having, supportive, guy. Notice anything wrong there? He's literally perfect. 

In fact, a later imperfection that arises from this character still just stems from his childhood, so blaming a kid for having a SMALL amount of emotional issues isn't really an imperfection, is it? Even his problems aren't really HIS problems! He's perfect! He resembles literally no guy I've ever met. In fact, I can't describe anyone I've ever known to be perfect. 

Yet, he, as well as Kitamura, is perfect. With this perfection lays an unconvincing narrative between Ryuuji and Taiga. For the first while their relationship just doesn't seem like something realistic because of his perfection.

In fact, the one imperfection they wanted to establish early on is that Ryuuji has ""creepy eyes."" Seriously, show? Creepy eyes? That's the best you can come up with? Even his ""imperfection"" is something he's BORN with and can't actually change. Its even dropped fairly quickly too!

Meanwhile Taiga deals with very real insecurities regarding her body. Her breast size and overall body structure leads to some undoubtedly relatable moments for girls. 

But If i was a girl I feel like i'd be very uncomfortable watching this show. Every girl character that's on screen constantly has some sort of emotional issue. Ryuuji's Mom, Minorin, Ami, Taiga, hell, even the blue haired school president who I don't even remember the name of ended up having repressed emotional issues!

Like, come on, show! Why are you making it so unbelievably weird? Why not give every guy character at least a modicum of respect when it comes to writing. Why are they either one-note joke machines or just sterile perfection? It makes it seem like they're saving a bunch of helpless girls from loneliness rather than a relationship that goes both ways... like a REAL relationship often does. 

It just feels weird. It can even feel sexist at times. Bluntly, I disliked the way every single male in the show was characterized. While Ryuuji thankfully gets a tiny bit of a personality towards the end of the show, its not nearly enough to create for a super compelling narrative.

Characters bring stories together. If a story is bad, good characters can save that. While the story here is an admirable use of cliche's, its undoubtedly bogged down by characters who just aren't interesting enough to keep the story afloat. 

_____________________________________________

[CONCLUSION] : 


So in conclusion, Toradora might just be one of the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. I never really loved ""Friends"", and I never really watched many anime romantic comedies either. Most romantic comedy movies are pretty god awful, too. With the exception of marvels like ""Me, Earl & the Dying Girl"", romantic comedies are just kind of shitty all around. 

Real recognize real, then. When a Rom-Com manages not to be horrifyingly awful, I can't help but praise it! Apart from maybe the solid sound work, I feel like every aspect of the show has very awesome highs, but also very noticeable lows. 

The story is ridden with cliches, but their done well. If it wasn't for the over Shounen-ing of a few major elements the story may have stood out more. 

The animation is incredibly solid and lively, but the disappointing character designs drag it down to a 7. 

Lastly, the characters have a lacking amount of effort put into them. Especially the guys. But that doesn't stop a small shining fractured star like Taiga to completely carry the show. 

Let me gush about her a little more, too. If you haven't seen this show do it just to see one of the cutest most love-to-hate-but-slowly-love-more characters I've ever seen. I doubt i'll be forgetting her presence on screen any time soon. She's great and the single reason that this show doesn't just sit at an ""above average"" but makes its way up to ""Good"" all around. 

So to wrap up this review in the most cliche possible way, here's another cheesy quote. 

""I hate waiting, but if waiting means being able to be with you I'll wait for as long as forever."" - Taiga"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I never thought that my number one favorite anime would be a rom-com, since I'm more of a shounen, battle, superheroes type of guy. However, Toradora was the first romantic anime I ever watched, and it quickly became my favorite.

From the moment I started watching it, I was hooked by its unique characters, heartfelt story, and beautiful animation. One of the things that I love most about Toradora is the way it portrays its characters. Each one is so complex and well-developed, with their own flaws and strengths that make them feel incredibly human. From the feisty Taiga to the kind-hearted Ryuji, every character in
                  ...
this show has something to offer, and I found myself invested in their individual journeys from start to finish.

But what really sets Toradora apart, in my opinion, is the way it handles relationships. The romance between Taiga and Ryuji is so beautifully crafted, with each moment feeling genuine and earned. I appreciated how the show took its time to develop their feelings for each other, rather than rushing into a relationship like so many other romance anime do.

The humor in this show is also top-notch, and I found myself laughing out loud more times than I can count. But it never feels like the humor detracts from the emotional weight of the story; rather, it adds to it by highlighting the characters' personalities and their interactions with each other.

I've rewatched Toradora around 5 times now, and every time I rewatch, I focus more on how the different characters behave, even side characters. It's amazing how even the minor characters are so well-written and bring so much to the story.

Overall, I can't recommend Toradora enough. If you're looking for a heartfelt, character-driven anime with plenty of laughs and tears, this is the perfect show for you. It's no wonder that it's my favorite anime of all time, and even though I never thought I'd enjoy a rom-com this much, Toradora has truly won me over."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I'm not the type of guy who usually watches romance anime and I've always avoided most things romance related since I deemed it to be a boring genre and one that's just simply not meant for me. Because of this I have just watched one other romance anime besides Toradora. But now that I have finished Toradora I can happily say that I was very wrong, romance can be just as interesting, if not more interesting than any other genre. Toradora was so good that it had me hooked since episode one and I finished watching it in just two days. It was, in fact,
                  ...
so good that it became one of my favourite anime ever.  

But what's the reason that I love this anime so much?

Well the main reason are the characters themselves. Every character is different and you will never find two that are the same. Firstly lest's talk about Ryuuji. He's very likeable and a pretty realistic character. He loves cooking and doing various chores. He's also oblivious to girls liking him. Taiga was by far my favourite character. Despite her being violent at times she's actually really kind at heart. We later learn that her violence is caused by the problems in her family, well mainly the problems with her father. Also her violent tendencies and verbal harrassing towards Ryuuji slowly dissapear and by the end of the anime she's nothing like her former self.  Yuusaku is Ryuuji's best friend and he really cares for him. He's also the popular kid in class, which is very weird since he looks like an average nerd in anime. In all honesty I wasn't really interested in him, but he was still a good character. Minorin was a very interesting character. She's hyperactive, very friendly and somewhat crazy, but in a good way. She's also a pretty selfless person and does everything she can to help those around her. Amin was the character that grew and changed the most out of Ryuuji and Taiga's three friends. When we first meet her in episode five we are made to believe that she's a stuck up bitch and because of this I really disliked her a lot. But as the anime progresses we learn more about her and why she acts like she does. And like I previously mentioned she also grows a lot as a person and by the end I ended up liking her a lot. Also the background characters were all pretty well written and didn't feel like random people without personalities.

Another strong suit of Toradora is the story. At the first glance you might think that it's just another generic highscool romance which there are a lot of currently, but in reality it's so much more. I can't really go into details without spoiling stuff so I'll say what I can. The story mostly avoids cliches which is pretty rare for anime that come out nowadays. The comedic moments sprinkled in the first half were really enjoyable, but I also loved how they started happening less and less and towards the end they were almost non-existant since everything became very serious. I was also really emotionally invested into Toradora which usually doesn't happen with other anime I watch and when I finished it I was left with the feeling of emptiness and sadness in me. The ending was good and altough I had hoped for more closure, I was still satisfied with it. Thankfuly there was a solution for the closure I was looking for and that came in the form of the last chapter of the light novel. I really crave for more Toradora, but seeing as it has been fourteen years since it came out I'm sure that there won't ever be a second season.

Also I just have to mention that the art and animation were also pretty good, especially for a 2008 anime.

All in all this has easily become one of my favourites. It was great and it sparked a interest for romance in me, so because of that I have to recommend it to everyone."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"i just finished the show like 2 days ago after seeing all the praise for it and how it's apparently one of the best romance (and comedy) animes and all that stuff. and maybe im missing something but i did NOT like this show at all. this is clearly a show that relies heavily on you sympathizing and/or liking all the characters, so maybe my dislike towards most of the cast is the reason i don't like this show. i can usually memorise an anime cast's names after maybe 10 episodes, but even watching episode 22 of toradora, i found myself wondering ""wait who's ryuuji?
                  ...
google searches ryuuji toradora to see the characters face "" because of how forgettable the cast was. 

the only time i liked the main character and the tiger (blonde hair short girl) is when they're alone together in a scene since i believe they have good chemistry together. anything outside of that circumstance i find them kinda annoying. 


MINORIN is REALLY FUCKIN ANNOYING HOLY SHIT. her entire character is being an overly obnoxious happy supporting character with a GASP SERIOUS SIDE TO HER WOAHHH WAIT YOU'RE TELLIN ME THE OVERLY HAPPY GIRL IN AN ANIME HAS FEELINGS??? WHAAATT and then the ending is some BUUUULLLSHITTTT acting as if she ever fuckin liked the main character. i genuinly believe the writers wrote the start and middle of the show as if minorin DIDN'T like ryuji but then added that part at the end for drama. its some serious bullshit imo she CLEARLY DIDN'T ROMANTICALLY LIKE THE RYUJI, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER. and also i dont even understand why i would ever cheer for her and ryuji to be together for that matter, even at the beginning all their conversations in the show together alone are super awkward, it's pretty much the same formula of ""minorin acts overly happy and makes the unfunniest jokes with ryuji, ryuji acts gullible as fuck to whatever she's saying, repeat last two steps X2, then out of nowhere minorin gets really deep with ryuji for some reason talking about her feelings acting like they're super conveluted"" IT'S SO ANNOYING TO START OFF A SCENE WITH THESE TWO WHEN I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE CONVERSATION IS GOING TO UNFOLD, IT MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE SUCH ROBOTS. 



the blue hair guy with glasses is such a weird oddball character, i find him so unlikeable for some reason. i think that part with him dyeing his hair blonde and being in love with the student council member was ACTUALLY interesting and it made me start to like him but after that he went back to his normal unlikeable self so it ended up leaving no impression on me. 
and that part where the lion goes to FIGHT the student council member might be the worst scene of this whole show for how TERRIBLY EXECUTED IT WAS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT HIGHLIGHT OF THE SHOW BUT THEY START THE SCENE OFF AS IF IT'S A JOKE. WHY DO THESE GOOFY ANIME GIRLS HAVE LIKE BAMBOO STICKS LMFAOOOOOO. I ACTUALLY FOUND IT FUNNY IN CONCEPT BUT THEN I SLOWLY REALISED oh this is supposed to be a serious scene cause now they're both bleeding. this scene ended up making the blonde hair girl super unlikeable too, especially when there's pretty much no consequence for what she did, which was pick a serious fight with an innocent student council member who's spent her years making sure your school life was a better experience, just because she didn't recipricate feelings for someone you like, WHICH SHE HAS A TOTALLY VALID REASON WHEN SHE EXPLAINS IT. and if you believe the consequence for the blonde hair girl was GETTING 2 WEEKS OFF, THAT'S A JOKE CAUSE BRO THAT'S BASICALLY JUST A FREE FUCKIN HOLIDAY LMAOOOO 



ryuuji's friends outside of the main group are way fuckin unlikeable and SO FORGETTABLE, i have nothing else to say about them, they have no character outside of talking about WOMEN and how awesome it would be for the girls to be maids at school and how sexy the blue hair model is because apparently that serves as comedy



speaking of the blue hair model, she's SOMEHOW THE ONLY CHARACTER I KIND OF LIKE, the start of her character was interesting, after she starts to become an asshole i liked the direction her character took, she's also a character that moves the plot along which im grateful for. however there's a lot of things i dont like about her either, like how for some reason she likes the main group of friends??? maybe im missing something there but whatever it's excuseable i guess maybe you just need her to like the main group of friends for the plot to advance. now, WHY DOES SHE EVEN LIKE RYUJI? I DONT FUCKIN KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE SHE DOESN'T KNOW EITHER, HE'S CLEARLY AN IDIOT AS YOU CALL HIM THAT EVERY INTERACTION YOU GUYS HAVE, maybe cause he's loving and nice to others? but there's barely enough scenes to justify that answer so i genuinly don't understand her love for him, maybe cause the two other girls like him? whatever
also about her appearence, i feel the same way about this that i do about ann from persona 5 (funny cause they both have the same english va hah), for some reason everybody praises her appearence even though she looks the exact fuckin same as every other girl in her school, even her body looks the same as everyone else's, there's nothing eyecatching about her, it's like the show is asking me to believe that she is just objectively more attractive than every other character in the show when it's just not true



anyways, i have nothing else to say about this show, it was so unbelieveably bad i dont understand how anyone could say this is a great anime in my opinion. i'd give it like maybe a 3-4/10"
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"I don't usually watch romantic anime. I started anime for the fight scenes and still spend most of my time on fighting-focused anime like One Piece and Naruto. 

But as invigorating as those are, they can't beat well-made, 2-cour anime like Toradora!, which are more compact and are more dense plot-wise per episode, if you know what I mean. One episode of a 1- or 2-cour anime is much more fulfilling than the average 1 episode of a long shonen, which typically requires 5+ episodes for minimum satisfaction. I watched the first 10 episodes of Toradora! sporadically, returned to episode 11, and stayed up all
                  ...
night watching the rest. This is the kind of romance story whose ending you can easily predict. This is a story with many romantic conflicts, whether triangles or one-sided or what have you. Toradora! is extremely well-written, with superb dialogue between the main characters as they go through their high school romantic struggles together. What happens is just... perfect. It's sad and uplifting at the same time. The protagonist, Ryuuji, reminds me of Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad. Both spend a lot of their time helping a girl with her problems, both have icky family situations, both are such noble characters. I admire Ryuuji a lot. Even though you can predict the ending, it's still sweet to watch. It's so bittersweet and touching. Love is truly a wily character. Many people make mistakes when pursuing others for love. Watch Toradora!, and learn from it. It says a very wise thing about finding your true love."
Toradora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Mixed Feelings,"Mehh!

I love shoujo animes but when it comes to toradora I can honestly say a anime has never made me love it and hate it at the same time, For the first half of the show I was enjoying it and found it pretty enjoyable, Until  the second half where the melo- drama comes in .

 I don't mind melo-drama but when it feels
                  ...
like its getting shoved down my throat that's when I stop, I can honestly say all the characters were getting on my  nerve by the time it ended. And don't get me started on how the ending couple turned out I mean of all the girls why her, I mean I understand why she fell for him,but how in the hell did he fall for her?. She could've been replaced by any other girl even Ami and the relationship would've made more sense.

Overall I didn't hate this anime but the cons severely out weight the pros, I know im  one of the few that didn't enjoy this show that much but I cant see why people praise this show so much."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Hers was a white lie built on a grain of truth that snowballed as one lie after the other piled up. At first it was only hers, but then it became something that the two of them shared together – like a secret, a world upon which no other could encroach. He may have been “Friend A,” and she “the girl that loves my best friend,” but they were masquerading around a truth that neither one could openly admit because ultimately, the truth was much more painful.

Your Lie in April is a deceitfully masterful series that initially appears light-hearted and colorful, its palette boasting pastels
                  ...
that lend to the idea of it being another romantic comedy. Yet the moment we step past the disillusionment that it casts upon us by its false prefaces, we quickly realize that what we have immersed ourselves in is actually a tragedy in the making.

Tragic not because of a single element but because of all of its parts, and yet at the end of everything, this isn’t a series about tragedy. It is a series about learning to heal, learning to move on, and learning to accept the parts of ourselves that we’d rather pretend aren’t there. Part of that is accepting that sometimes we need a helping hand to take that first step. Part of it is learning to say goodbye when the time comes.

What is so compelling about the storyline is that it’s not merely an adventure into first love, it delves into the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood abuse, and chronic illness. It doesn’t paint any of these as artistic or tragically beautiful—they are horrible, they twist people, they ruin the best moments, and they have a long-lasting impact.

No one is completely black-and-white; everyone has their short-comings, fleshed out in full before our eyes. They have their hang-ups, their strengths, their struggles—and it’s in these characters that this series really takes off in full stride. It would be enough for them to be multifaceted with equal amounts of depth, but they take it a step further in painting the reality of youth.

Older anime fans may critically analyze the series as an unrealistic approach to young teenagers, but that pessimism overlooks the reality of what it was like for us to be that age. We were all that point when we found our first love, when we thought it was forever, when we poured our passion into something that ultimately would not come to fruition or last. That’s what being young is about—and that’s what Your Lie in April gives us. 

Granted that it may veer a bit over-dramatic at times in its representation of youth; there are moments of symbolism or hyperbole so overt that the cheesiness makes you shift a little uncomfortably in your seat (but I promise it’s not enough to gag you). Given that this is, however, a rather common trope that runs in series with heavier themes, it’s not necessarily a huge setback for an otherwise solid series. In the end, it is intended to be a fictional representation that conveys more than just what can be summarized in a few sentences or less.

The sound is completely on point, and the soundtrack artfully matches the emotions intended to be represented in each scene. From the actual classical music to the opening and ending, everything fits in like a jigsaw puzzle to give a full, satisfying final piece. When the characters analyze someone’s playing as harsh, rigid, and stilted, we can hear this—whether we are knowledgeable about music or not. Your Lie in April conveys emotion to us not just visually but aurally as well.

The animation is wonderful with bright, vibrant colors that bring the characters fully to life. There is an amazing, visually perceivable transition for the characters as time passes, particularly in regards to Kaori as the series moves on. It occasionally has some stilted moments but nothing outrageously noticeable to detract from the overall quality.

Ultimately, Your Lie in April is a story that starts out of the gates moving a bit slowly, but the pace matches the tone of the series. Structurally, it is a solid story of youth that dramatizes some aspects but never distracts from the intended message. On top of its other strong points, it’s aurally and visually a joy to the senses – and to anyone appreciative of a series willing to realistically approach the conflict of childhood abuse and the resulting trauma in a positive way. It’s not without a few setbacks, but in the end, Your Lie in April fashions itself to be a stand-out romance series that reminds us that while some relationships may be transient and brief, some people will come into our lives at just the right time for just long enough to touch us in a way we never thought possible."

I nearly skipped this gem just because of the music tag. Not really big into music anime but somehow the art dragged me into watching the first few episodes. First episode was an average episode with few interesting plot lines. But the second episode was the hook. Irony. The tag that made me nearly skip this anime was the one that kept me in it. The music, the music... THE MUSIC.. what can I say? It was just right down my taste. Never in my life did I thought of ""oh hey let's listen to some classical
                  ...
music"" but this anime opened a new taste in music in me. And I'm grateful for that. 

The first half and second half have clear differences with a very smooth pacing and objectives in mind. Some may say the pacing was slow and sometimes it felt that a point is being dragged out for long. As much as I understand where they are coming from, I feel that this series took the right amount of time to build up for the many impact full moments that is present. The inner monologues that the series loves to do felt right to display the conflicts that our characters are fighting with. Also, the conflicts dealt with are very realistic and people can very much relate to them. I happen to be one of them being able to relate to our main male protagonist. 

The cast of characters in this show is pretty high. As a 22 episode anime, I think it did an excellent job portraying those characters. As most animes, not all the characters were fully fleshed out, and I didn't expect it to do so. The ones that mattered most were developed beautifully. Besides, nearly everyone's thought process were clear, motivations/purpose in tact and passion which shone through. 

Sound is something that I will not even talk about since it is subjective. The main reason, however, that I will not dive deeper is because for me, it was perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything more. 

Animation wise. Throughout the whole series, it was standard stuff from A-1 Pictures. It did have some drop from time to time, especially during the comedy segments, which I didn't find distracting but it wasn't great to say the least. Animation stood out where it counts. Those performances. I would have been really been disappointed if the animation was average in those moments, because of how beautiful the soundtracks are. But A-1 delivered, and they both complimented each other outstandingly. 

By the end of the series, I was just left in awe, and honestly a bit (extremely) emotional. To compare, the 'feels' in this series (my opinion) surpasses the highly praised Clannad: After Story for one simple reason. I was just slightly more attached to the relationship our main characters shared than I was with Clannad. But the story is not about tragedy. It's about inspiration, passion, moving forward, family, friendship, helping each other (many more). It is about life and how hard it can be to carry on, but you still gotta do it. You still gotta live your life to your fullest.

""If you can't move with your hands then play with your feet! If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well! Whether you're sad, you're a mess, or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play! That's how people like us survive."" - Kaori Miyazono. 

Overall 9.4/10."

Even though the story isn't anything new, the way it was written and directed make it feel like one. It is a story that revolves around music and how it connects people and how it affects them. It does not only affect them in a good way, but in a bad way too. And with that premise, a beautiful story about tennagers started.

Although there were some characters that didn't get a proper development to know and understand their own problems, motivations, and
                  ...
dreams, they didn't feel empty and meaningless. They all had a purpose and most of them where helpful to our main characters. They didn't feel cliché neither, even when we got some of them like the childhood friend and the dandy best-friend. And the best part, at least to me, is that there was no fan-service. 

I didn't get to see a flaw in the animation in the 22 episodes aired. The palette of colours used, especially the blue ones, were gorgeous, while the performance moments were dynamic and realistic. Not to mention the opening and ending sequences, which are to date some of my favourites of all time.

Add to this a beautiful ost and amazing songs for the openings and endings and you'll feel in heaven. The opening songs were upbeat and represented a good tonal contrast to the story, while the ending songs complemented it, especially the second one, which can make you cry (if you were not crying already) after the emotional final episodes.

Overall, this anime has been one of the bests I've ever seen. It hooked me since the first teaser, and never let me go until the last episode. It is not a hard story, so everyone can enjoy it as much as I did. With loveable and relatable characters with deep stories, a gorgeous animation and an amazing score, I'm pretty sure that this is one of the best anime from the past few years, and the best (TO ME) of this season. I can recommend this show to anyone who want to watch and experience a good, heart-warming romance anime."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**

The latest romantic-comedy/drama to take the anime world by storm is a little project known as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or as many people know it, “Your Lie in April”. YLA has been the talk of the last two seasons as it has managed to captivate audiences around the world with its unbelievably bright colors and fantastic musical score complete with both famous classical pieces and original hits. However, if there is one thing about this show that people can’t help but gorge themselves on, it’s the melodrama. That’s right folks: a romantic show contains MELODRAMA! Try to contain your surprise! Since
                  ...
intense over-exaggeration is virtually the only way to make shows like this interesting, know that I’m willing to overlook melodrama to a certain degree… But not to THIS degree. Ladies and gentlemen: Do you think you know monologuing? Oh ho ho, you’re about to.

Synopsis: Kousei Arima is a former piano-playing prodigy; he was the best player alive for his young age until some serious mental trauma forced him to quit. He has refused to touch a musical instrument ever again, until he meets an eccentric girl named Kaori Miyazano; the girl who would change his life forever.

YLA got off to a charming start with a great comedic focus while still hinting at a sufficiently dramatic backstory. In combination with the previously mentioned art and music, this anime showed promise. By the time the breathtaking violin performance in episode 2 had finished, pretty much everyone was hooked on this show, and understandably so. However, it didn’t take long for it to divulge into one of the most laughable and overly drawn-out excuses for a narrative I’ve ever seen. This show is about 10% original content and about 90% REPEATING THAT SAME CONTENT. Over and over and over and over and over and over again! You’d think it was a parody of an anime drama rather than an actual iteration into the genre if you didn’t know any better. This anime should have been 12 episodes TOPS, especially considering all the pointless side characters that serve no purpose. Instead, we get an anime that is just monologuing on top of monologuing episode after episode. You REALLY have to slog to get through all of it. I find it hard to pay attention to a show that’s just going to spell everything out for me a million times; ever hear of subtlety? SHOW. Don’t tell.

That’s not to say that the drama is all that bad when they actually decide to advance the plot though. There are several instances of legitimately investing and interesting storytelling in this anime, but it’s too few and far between be worthy of any real praise. Not to mention that it is constantly interrupted by inopportune comedy during or immediately following a dramatic moment. The strange thing is that the comedy can be pretty good too; this show has gotten more than one chuckle out of me. The problem lies in the directing, which is causing these elements to work against each other rather than cooperatively. Instead of adding another dimension to the show, the comedy merely dulls the edge of the more important dimension, and that’s obviously a major problem.

The characters aren’t necessarily bad, but I found them to be pretty poorly handled overall. Kousei, for example, is inconsistent. He will tell the audience how he feels about the SAME thing in SAME way over and over and over again, but there are also times when we should know what he is thinking and simply don’t. For example, it’s nonsensical how the most minor of exchanges will stick with him throughout the entire show and be monologued about dozens of times, but then major interactions between him and anybody not named Kaori are instantly forgotten even when they should be having a major impact on him. Kousei is an okay character, but his backstory is really the only thing that defines him. I was personally more partial to his best friend, Tsubaki, whose alternate perspective of having to deal with a struggling friend is often more interesting than the person who is actually suffering. 

Kaori, on the other hand, really held the show back in my opinion. Yes she’s cute, yes her violin performance was the best scene of the show, and yes she is the source of lots of drama. The problem is that she is treated a lot more like a plot device and a lot less like a character. With all the monologuing that goes on in this show, can someone explain to me why we never find out Kaori’s true feelings in regards to so many events? Where exactly does her love of music come from? How does it motivate her? What are her specific feelings on Kousei at various intervals in the show? What about Watari? We don’t know until the final episode of the show so we can pretend that all this vital information which we desperately need to get invested in her is some sort of Shyamalan twist; it's completely immature and ineffective. Kaori simply shows up, does whatever she needs to do to create drama, then leaves. She is the weakest character in the show and a big reason why I found the romance to be poorly executed and completely one-sided. I never felt like I knew this person.

In conclusion, Your Lie in April is a cheesy drama loaded with inopportune comedy and cringe-worthy dialogue. It has its moments and the musical score/animation are wonderful, but bad directing and the lack of so much as an ounce of subtlety killed it. If you’re one of those mushy-gushy drama lovers, I really can’t recommend against this show since its flaws aren’t too much more egregious than what you would normally see, but if not, I don’t think you need to go out of your way to watch it by any means."

                                      (11/22 eps)","Making use of a calm, vibrant palette, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso begins by depicting a mysterious blonde chasing after a black cat. Weirdly enough, it feels like it's meaningful; each camera angle is loose and meticulously timed, and the cuts between don't hinder the flow. I soon came to realize, however, that the problems lie not in the execution, but the narrative; so much so that it ends up being more of an eye-catcher than a drama. 

The struggles musicians face are apparent for most: Writer's block, commitment, or even becoming notable are some of the most common examples of these. Arima's struggles, on
                  ...
the other hand, are quite different. Ever since the death of his abusive mother, he's been too traumatized to hear his own playing. But when he meets the aforementioned blonde, Kaori, that all changes. Dubbed love at first sight, the series documents the ongoings of Arima and Kaori as they succumb to the world of music. By itself, this is no problem, but by introducing these characters minutes apart, we're given no time to really understand either of them. Instead, the viewer learns of Arima's past through an intrusive series of flashbacks throughout. Placing these sequences in the middle of recitals and performances disregards any tension that they may have created in the first place. Because of this, winning or losing doesn't matter; it's unsatisfying and hard to care either way. 

Sadly, this isn't the only problem Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso faces. The dialogue feels like that of a middle school creative writing project, and when combined with a healthy amount of melodrama, it's hard not to laugh in ridicule each time Arima whines about his ""monotone"" life. In fact, it's a challenge to take this seriously. Each episode is filled with around ten or more minutes of these monologues, and in the end, it feels mostly redundant; a way to drag out the length of the series. The rest of the cast isn't even as lucky – the only information we get about them is regarding their past tragedies or to further the annoyingly weak symbolism regarding growing up. Since every major character is about 14, any appeal to emotion through dialogue only comes off as disposable and pretentious teenage angst. Constant similes are made regarding the texture and flavour of any musical performance, but they sound completely hilarious and synesthetic (""The smell of chalk. […] The faint breathing of someone asleep.""). There's even some comedy here and there, but it's incredibly unfunny and gets in the way of the little drama that's left - by portraying gags with brief changes in artstyle,  the otherwise appealing consistency of the animation is interrupted. It might be welcome in a comedy series, but why is it here?

Despite my other complaints, the OST itself is fairly interesting. While the arrangements of traditional classical pieces are nothing to get too excited about, they're nice enough to listen to for   a few minutes while trudging through the rest of the show. Arima's disjointed playing isn't always welcome, though, as some parts sound a little too horrible. Even deaf musicians of his skill level and tenure should be unable to play that badly when given basic theory lessons. The OST itself consists of mostly ambient music to build tension, but it isn't anything too extraordinary – any fan of electronic music should find most of these tracks dull and utterly forgettable. The OP, on the other hand, is something that kept me watching each week; Goose House's acoustic  harmonies really set the mood for the show, and I dare say that nothing else in the series lives up to it. 

As a package, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is bloated and gimmicky to the point of exhaustion, but it's decent entertainment nonetheless. The main storyline doesn't even progress for eleven episodes. It's like a Pitchfork résumé. If you're looking for a pretty experience and not too much more, you should definitely give the series a try — maybe even marathon it now that it's over!"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"This series is overrated. It peaked my interest when I saw it on the front page at the highest rated anime on this site. I thought to myself this was worth a watch, I definitely won't be disappointed since the top rated anime here pretty much deserve to be there. How wrong was I.

Let me first start by saying this series is melodramatic, slow-paced and cliched as hell. We have Arima Kousei, a depressed and traumatized 14-year-old pianist prodigy who lost his abusive mother two years prior to the story. The anime may come off as an anime that focuses a lot on music, but
                  ...
music is merely a sub-genre here. If you're watching this anime just for the music, you will be disappointed more than me. I couldn't symphatize with any of the characters in the story, it was pretty much predictable all the time. The romance is pretty below par too. 

We're introduced to two rivals early in the story, but that's about it, they don't really have any impact or effect the main character in anyway. They end up being just mere acquaintances by the end. They tried to redeem his horrible mother whiched failed miserably. Characters are crying all the time, then they bring out a loli in the middle of the series with nothing to add to the story, just a mandatory irrelevant loli which seems to be a running occurance in every anime now. The main character barely develops during the story, he doesn't really accomplish anything in the musical world during the 22-episode course of the series, we're constantly having flashbacks about his past and how horrible his mother was to him. The dialogue in the series sounded too poetic and cheesy most of the time, and we're are constantly thrown life quotes at us, which was funny to me considering the main characters are 14-year-olds.

Of course it has its strong points too. The animation really flows well with the series and while I'm not a fan of classical music, I must say I enjoyed the music being played throughout the series. But that doesn't exclude the fact that there are hundreds of anime out there with the same school drama setting with teenagers as main characters. This series ain't no Clannad, it just tries too hard. The main girls all seem to have a thing for the main character, but I didn't feel much romance effect here. The story was all about Arima coming out of his depressed self and back to the real world again. The ending wasn't really a tearjerker, as I predicted it way before during the course of the series, so there was no element of surprise here.

Overall I can't say I particuarly enjoyed the series nor would I recommend it to others. I guess I COULD recommend it to someone who is particuarly interested in music, but then I'd also would recommend K-ON as well. It isn't a masterpiece like people are constantly saying. It's not bad but it's not good either - just average."

If you liked it for the drama, unrequited loves, and music, try Kids on the Slope.

----------------

It's about a piano genius boy who has been mentally abused by his over controlling, psycho mom, and thus is dealing with issues regarding his piano/musical life. Meets a forceful girl who's to change all that. She literally just comes along and forces him to do things her way. Most of the story is just so unrealistically exaggerated. You
                  ...
just can't take it seriously. This show is drama, I understand, but this is melodrama to the next level. I couldn't help laughing at parts I should be feeling sentimental about instead. Speaking of laughing, this serious show also attempts to throw in a bit of comedy.  Fine, but make sure it's funny before you go and do that. The comedy scenes for the most part didn't work for me. It just felt forced, not natural, and well....not funny. 

They have things repeated to you over and over, and even in the same episode sometimes. Good god, way to make use of the 22 min screen time you get. The story is kinda predictable, and the fact that they spell everything out for you doesn't help to alleviate the boredom. Throw in some unrealistic, overdone drama, and you're left cringing for the most part. 

The art. The only thing that will fool you into thinking this anime is great. I wouldn't say the animation is top notch, but the art is indeed pleasing to the eye. The OST is kinda nice as well. That's it. Those are the only pros to this show. 

For this to creep up even in the top 50s, I don't even know what to think. It's not terrible, but it's way way way overrated, and I can't fathom why it's in the top 15 on MAL (at the time of writing). The quality of the story, the script, and the characters doesn't feel like it warrants this anime to be in the top 50 even.

I fine with drama. Heck I LOVE a good touching show with or without romance. This show though, eventually became something I had to force myself to keep watching. If you are expecting this to be top quality anime that all should watch because it's sitting up here near the top of the list, you may find yourself severely disappointed... unless you're a preteen who loves romance and over the top sob stories. Then by all means go for it.

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"If you don't want to read, then there’s a tl;dr at the end, as well as a tl;dr for every section.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or Your Lie in April, is 24-episode anime that started airing in October 2014, and ended in March 2015. Since its end, it has been a subject of hot debate on this site. Usually there are 2 types of people for any controversial show, those who love it to no end, and those who flat out despise it.  I personally am somewhere on the fence.

Now is it the best anime ever? No. Is it bad? Definitely not. Then what
                  ...
exactly is Shigatsu?

Well, at its core Shigatsu is a story about a boy(Arima Kousei) who used to be a fantastic pianist at a young age. Unfortunately, during his growth, he lost his mother, something that left him unable to hear the piano ever again. Or at least until he met a violinist named Kaori Miyazono, who tries to help him return to music.

Well, that’s the basis of the story. Now onto the review.

Story:- 6/10

The story of Shigatsu has both good and bad sides to it. Before we delve into the bad, let’s take a look at the good.

The story, as you would normally expect, has a lot of romance, which is done pretty well. The romance in Shigatsu, is very heartfelt at times and also very fun at other times. The story tries to maintain a perfect balance of comedy and real romance, which does work, most of the time.

Unfortunately, this show is also a melodrama, which is the bad part. The drama in this show apparently got many people teary-eyed, but, I have a hard time believing that. The show tries way too hard to make you feel some “feels”, and pretty much drops flat on its face. The show constantly tries to shove its drama in your face, from episode 13 onwards, and it gets annoying at times. Before episode 13, it still had some dramatic moments, but those were much better done, showing Kousei’s inner fears.

As I previously mentioned, the show is filled with comedy, romance, and now, drama. When you but all these in a blender what do you get? Well if the blender was a good one, then you might get something amazing. But this wasn’t a good blender. Instead what we got was a drink with a beautiful exterior, but a bad aftertaste.

Since Shigatsu thinks it’s a drama, but also tries to make time for comedy and romance, we get painfully abrupt scenes of melodrama, followed closely by comedy, which does not fit at all.

One second we might be seeing a person die, and the other we see Kousei getting kicked by his “not-girlfriend”, Tsubaki.

Speaking of which, the romance aspect isn’t flawless either. Somewhere during the time that the show was trying to find what genre it belongs to, we got a love-triangle. Now, it really isn’t as bad as I make it sound, but it’s still a bit cliché at times. Boy A loves Girl A, Girl A loves Boy B, Girl B loves Boy A, and Boy B doesn’t give a shit.

The romance isn’t complex but it still does get stale at times.

But, for as much as I railed on the story, it has one saving grace. The ending. The final episode is probably the best part of this anime, in my opinion. It’s a simple monologue by the female lead, Kaori. But it’s so beautifully written that I couldn’t help but be engrossed by it.

TL;DR for STORY : The story has pretty good romance, which gets slightly stale near the middle. The excess of melodrama mixed with the comedy is probably the biggest flaw of the story, since those are two genres that should be implemented far away from each other. But, no matter how many flaws it has, its ending is beautiful in every way possible. Great writing, good background music, very good voice acting, and beautiful art. Speaking of art, let’s move on to the next section.


Art and Animation:- 9/10

The art of Shigatsu is probably the best part of it. It changes according to the mood of the scene, and fits the overall feel of the show. It’s very bright most of the time, and it everything ranging from the night sky to the school playground look gorgeous.

The character designs for the main characters are well done, and easily recognizable. The adults were also very well designed, to a point that you could actually guess their age. The only flaw I see with the character design are the children. It might just be me, but it’s weird to see children who have buttons for eyes, which makes them stand out in comparison to the rest of the cast.

Most of the time the animation is very fluent, and everything moves very nicely. The performance scenes are where the real budget went though. Accompanied with great music, it uses CGI for the piano, and extremely fluent animation for the violin. The CGI is a bit odd, and does stick out sometimes, but it did not distract from the focus of the scene, the performance.

TL;DR for ART : The art in Shigatsu is the best part of it, with a hefty use of colors, and a very bright scenery which changes according to the mood and feel of the scene. Most of the character designs are pretty good, besides the children in the show. The animation is fluent for the most part, and the performance scenes were amazing. Even though the CGI piano was a bit jarring at times, it didn’t distract me from what really mattered in the scene, the music.


Sound:- 8/10

Being an anime focused around music, one would normally think that the music of the show should be its strongest point, including me. But no, that’s sadly not the case.

Towards the beginning the performances were all amazing with the focus remaining solely on the performance and nothing else. But this is soon forgotten in the latter half of the show. The music itself is very good, or at least as much of the music I could hear. 

The performances(in the latter half) are constantly interrupted by monologues, which are meant to bring up the drama, but instead come off as a distraction and an annoyance. Most of the performances I was yelling at the screen “Stop talking! I’m trying to listen to the brilliance that you’re playing!”. I personally am a fan of classical music, so when someone talks over it, I get very annoyed, and feel like punching a hole through the screen.

That being said, the overall soundtrack of the show, excluding the performances, was pretty good. Although no song really stood out to me.

The voice actors also do their jobs pretty well, with all of the voices fitting the characters. Especially Kaori and Kousei’s voice actors.

But of course, nothing in the show can top it’s masterful opening. Opening 1(Hikaru Nara), is probably one of the best openings I’ve ever heard in a while. The second opening(Nanairo Symphony) while not as good, was still great. Both endings were also pretty well done, but the second ending(Orange) is the better of the two.

TL;DR for MUSIC : The show should focus on music, but instead many of the performances are spoken over for the majority of the time. The show tried to bring drama into the mix again (by talking over the performances) but failed horribly in this case. The soundtrack of the show is pretty good, and the voice actors do the characters justice. Its openings and endings are few of the best of 2014, and Opening 1 is one of my favorite openings of all time.


Characters:- 5/10

This is where Shigatsu really fails. It’s not that there isn’t any character development, but certain characters, who needed development, didn’t get any. I’ll start with the good.

Kousei: He’s probably the character who is best developed throughout the entire show. After meeting Kaori, he starts to regain his will to play music, and starts to overcome his fears. Many other characters, including Kaori, act as foils in his development, like his friends, teacher, his rivals, and even his pupil. His development is the one that got the most focus in the entire story, but maybe even too much.

Kaori: This is where I feel that the characters fail. Since I can’t talk too much about Kaori without spoilers, I’ll be as careful as possible to avoid spoiling anything. Kaori is probably the character who had the most potential to develop, but instead, she was used as a mere plot device. Something to simply be present to help Kousei grow. While I did praise Kousei’s development, it’s not worth sacrificing the development of another character that could’ve grown into so much more. In fact, she was probably the character who I loved the most in the entire show, so I was extremely disappointed to see her get sidelined as a plot device with no depth at all.

Tsubaki: She’s the other main female lead, and the other love interest of Kousei. In other words Girl B. She also played a large role in Kousei’s development, but here, unlike Kaori, she also got some development. While she didn’t get a lot of development, she was still the second-most developed character in the show, which was a step in the right direction.

Other Characters: Most of the other characters are just treated as side characters, but some of them are developed. In fact Kousei’s rivals and his pupil, all get some development, which was nice to see.

TL;DR for CHARACTERS: The entire story of Shigatsu seems to focus on both Kousei and Kaori, but in fact it focuses just on Kousei. He is developed the most throughout the show, while Kaori gets the shortest possible end of the stick. Her development was expected, but it never came to be. The other characters sometimes got some development, and the other female love interest also got some development.


Enjoyment:- 8/10

As much as I might rag on the show, and no matter how many flaws I point out in it, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, some characters got on my nerves, and the performances were really disappointing when someone talked over them, but even with all those flaws, I still enjoyed watching it.

Most of the time I was engrossed by the beautiful exterior of the show, and at other times, I was yelling at the characters to stop talking over the music. But, it was still a fun ride.



Pros:
+ Great animation.
+ Brilliant Openings and Endings
+ A beautiful ending
+ A well developed main lead, and a likable cast of characters.
+ Enjoyable, if you don’t try to notice the flaws.

Cons:
- Terribly developed female lead, with a ton of misused potential
- Performances were often talked over
- Story tries way too hard to be a drama, but in reality is just a mediocre melodrama


TL;DR for OVERALL:

Overall, the anime definitely isn’t bad, but it doesn’t know what it wants to be. It thinks it’s a drama and tries to act like one, but it had much more potential as a simple romance. If it wanted to be a drama, then it didn’t need to add so much comic relief at every second. It keeps trying to get tears out of you, but it tries way too hard to do so. The characters were also something that needed a lot of work, with Kaori being one of the most misused characters in the show.

On the plus side, the anime looks gorgeous, and it has some of the best openings of all time, along with performances that could’ve been much better, but were still very well done. The final episode is also a very good part of the show, meaning that the show has a brilliant ending.

In the end, it’s not a masterpiece, nor is it garbage. It’s a good experience, that I can recommend watching.

Overall: 7.2/10"

This is because the series brings you in with gorgeous visuals, fantastic sound work, an interesting concept and elements of delicious suspense... and then lets you down with horrible story execution, insufferable characters, and an ending which makes you want to go into ""Kyle mode"" and punch a hole through the fucking screen. I really, really wanted to like this series... but it just wouldn't let me.

To get it out of the way, here is how I rated the show (out of 10):

***SPOILER
                  ...
WARNING: PLOT ELEMENTS & ENDING REVEALED***

I thought about going into detail on everything wrong, and right, about the series, but I think it would be better if I went into the two things that drag this series down into the pits: Kaori, and the ""twist"" ending.

Let us begin with Kaori, who is one of the most terrible female MCs I have ever seen. She is selfish, dishonest, manipulative, abusive, self-righteous and histrionic, far more resemblant of a spoiled, ditzy cheerleader than a well-accomplished music prodigy. She spends the entire series forcing Kousei to relive traumatic experiences just so she can get him to play the piano, either as her accompaniment on-stage or simply for her own amusement, all the while leading him on with mixed signals as she is dating his best friend, a popular jock-type who is almost his exact opposite. She constantly belittles him for doing any little thing she doesn't like, hitting him excessively and/or talking down to him like a misbehaving child. On occasion, she will be incredibly sweet & endearing towards him while they're hanging out... before eventually ditching him abruptly to hang out with her boyfriend. This shit is textbook psychological abuse.

Such behavior by itself doesn't necessarily mean the character is poorly-written, but what makes it particularly unpleasant is that her bullshit is presented as though it were a good thing for all parties involved! She is framed as some quasi-tsundere goddess with a heart of gold when she is actually just a sick, twisted, manipulative teenage bitch with a superiority complex. Talk about cognitive dissonance! Had she been portrayed as more damaged and/or morally-ambiguous, which would have been more suited to her actions, the entire series would have been drastically improved as a result, and she would have been, in the end, a far more compelling and even likable character... but that is not what happened.

Which brings us to the abysmal ""twist"" ending: It turns out that she was in love with Kousei all along and only dated his best friend to get close to him - the titular lie in April: ""I like Watari"" - claiming that she didn't have the confidence to approach him; however, Kousei doesn't find out about this until he reads it in a note, which she arranged to have delivered to him only after she was already dead.

What. The. Fuck.

So let me get this straight: She spends how many months belittling this poor kid over the agonizing pain he has experienced due to the death of his abusive & overbearing mother by being incredibly abusive herself, playing with his emotions and leading him on the entire time, all while dating a guy she secretly doesn't even like just to subject him to this disgusting behavior... because she was in love with him?! How fucking pathetic! Seriously, it's like watching an eight year-old boy go bully his crush on the playground because he doesn't want the other boys to make fun of him. Oh, and let's not overlook her bullshit excuse about not having the confidence - yeah, as if I am going to believe that a bubbly & outgoing teenaged girl doesn't have the guts to start up conversation with a shy loner, especially since she had no issue with beating & scolding him throughout the entire fucking show. This plot twist, and how it was executed, instantly made Kaori one of the most unlikable characters imaginable, and further ruined what little enjoyment the series could have brought to the table.

Again, had they presented Kaori and/or the revelation differently, this twist could have instantly made her more compelling, sympathetic & endearing, and had you looking at her actions in an entirely different light, especially since harboring such love for Kousei would have seemed more antithetical to her personality. Instead, we get a boring-yet-infuriating resolution to a mediocre story that leaves you feeling anything but satisfied.
_______________

IN SUMMATION: As I said before, this show had a world of potential, and I really did want to like it. I honestly thought it would have everything I wanted in a story like this, and it started out strong enough to make me anticipate the rest of the series... but then it took a watery shit all over my expectations, leaving me annoyed & dissatisfied in the end. Fucking blah."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"TL;DR A not unenjoyable series with some fantastic musical performances, that unfortunately suffers from forced drama, shallow characters, a drawn out, surprisingly predictable story & a tendency to have characters talk at length about what the music being played expresses rather than let us listen & hear it for ourselves. If you're looking for a tearjerker that will do everything short of poke you in the eye to get those tears flowing, Your Lie in April (YliA) might be for you. If you're looking for something more, you might want tosearch elsewhere.

 Music is the food of love. Something like that, anyway. It is certainly
                  ...
used by many as a means of expressing emotions in ways they cannot put into words. Indeed you'll find few things that people (at least teenagers) will identify so strongly with as a favourite song or a passion for playing. But what might it take to kill that passion in someone? & if you met someone who had lost their love for music, what would it take to bring it back? These are the questions YliA sets out to answer & asks you to come with it. (Note that while I don't consider anything discussed a meaningful spoiler, you may think otherwise)

The boy for whom the music died is Kousei Arima, a gifted & renowned pianist as a child but having lost all passion or even the ability to play since the death of his (psychotic) mother. Now he just wiles away the days, transcribing sheet music & hanging out with his childhood friends Tsubaki  Sawabe & Ryouta Watari, stuck in that awkward period when no longer a child but not yet ready to be an adult. Then one day, in a scene that pays homage to Laputa: Castle in the Sky, he meets Kaori Miyazono, the carefree girl who he can't take his eyes off & who quickly takes it upon herself to break Kousei out of his shell & bring back his passion for music, whether he wants to or not. 

If there is one rule that anime frustratingly breaks all too often, it's that of show, don't tell. Specifically, that it is better to show something through action rather than through exposition. YliA is full of this. Musical performances are an important part of the story & used as a means for the characters to work through internally whatever their “thing” at that point is, be it determination to prove that they're better than the competition or, often in Kousei's case, trying to overcome his personal demons so he can play. Musical performance, particularly of classical pieces with different sections & phrases that allow for the expression of different emotions, is a perfect for this. The actual performances in YliA are fantastic, with a range of Chopin & other classical pieces (although a little more variety or more well known pieces might have been appreciated) performed to a high standard but also in such a way that it mirrors the emotions of the performer, which is impressive considering we're watching cartoon characters play a cartoon piano. Indeed the music, both the original pieces & those by classical composers, is most certainly the strongest point of YliA.

Unfortunately, in almost every performance the music plays for about 20-30 seconds before someone's internal monologue starts talking all over it, usually as a form of very long winded exposition explaining what the performer is feeling. This isn't always a bad thing. When it accompanies more surreal visual expressions of the performers emotional state, such as when Kousei is playing only to find himself apparently enveloped in water & unable to hear the music, having his inner thoughts accompany the scene can add to it. However, more often than not our listening is simply interrupted by a still shot of the someone's head while they talk in detail about what we'd be able to hear & see for ourselves if only we were allowed to. 

It's made all the more frustrating on the few occasions, such as the duet between Kousei & Nagi Aiza, where the exposition is kept to a relative minimum & the music allowed to just play, letting us see the two characters play off each other as they start with a fairly pedestrian rendition before gradually raising the tension in the scene as they both start to play off of & try to outdo the other. It just makes the scene that much more enjoyable to be allowed to just follow the performance without having someone talk over it to tell you what you could be listening to. Likewise the final performance, which I won't spoil, suffice to say that it is a nearly nine minute performance where everything comes together to produce a genuinely engrossing piece of animation. The high point is a nearly three minute part where no words are heard, with everything expressed simply by the facial expressions & body movements of Kousei & Kaori as they play together. If only the same could be said of all that came prior.

This may well simply be due to a mixture of practical constraints (animating multiple 5-10minute performance at a consistent quality can't be easy or cheap) & a hangover from the manga where, of course, there's no music to accompany the panels. It would be more forgiveable if it wasn't for the additional problem that the scriptwriter/author/translator seem to have a false sense of their own literary prowess, writing with a “why say it in a sentence when a metaphor laden paragraph will do?” approach. The use of poetic language isn't a problem in itself, but the characters monologues just go on & on, spouting simile after metaphor, often to the point that  it's hard not to be somewhat taken out of the moment. Kousei is a repeat offender of this, often unable to think about anything without employing multiple mixed metaphors. It doesn't help that despite all the words, the characters in YliA don't really think about much. Kousei monologues about his (abusive) mum & Kaori; Kaori about Kousei & music; Tsubaki about Kousei & childhood; & Watari about nothing because he's a plot device, not a character.

In fact all the cast in YliA are surprisingly shallow characters considering all they have to say. Watari just exists so there is someone in the way of Kousei & Kaori having a romantic relationship (because she's gotta stay on that pedestal, after all), playing no meaningful role beyond that. Tsibaki is the childhood friend & third corner of the triangle that every romance must have, while her boyfriend/senior Saito & classmate Kashiwagi are just there so she can talk to someone about her feelings for Kousei  other than the audience. Kousei's mum is just a (very abusive) albatross hanging around his neck that he needs to shed in order to move on from his childhood, & Kaori herself is ultimately only there to first encourage him out of his past & then her own misfortune to make him take the next steps into adulthood. Kousei of course bumbles fairly passively through all this, to the point that at times it feels more like watching the author kick a puppy than anything else. It doesn't help that on occasion the plot takes some ridiculous twists purely for the sake of melodrama at Kousei's expense. At one point, for example, he nearly drowns in a swimming pool because, rather than try to swim, he sinks to the bottom miming a piano because the water is what it feels like when he's trying to play. As examples of forced drama go, YliA has some pretty egregious ones.

Indeed, on more than a few occasions the show takes an uncomfortable turn into outright cynical emotional manipulation of the audience. Kousei's childhood seems to exist purely for this purpose, as though you can hear the writer shouting “look at this child! Doesn't he make you feel sad? No? How about if his mother hits him over the head with a cane? Are you sad now? DO YOU FEEL!?” Yes, YliA, I do feel. Apparently, however, you don't, because despite all this clear abuse Kousei was put through everyone else just seemed to take a “not my problem, not my business” view to it. Kousei's mum is depicted as a psychotic child abuser, destroying her son's mental health so she can live vicariously through his success. Despite this, however, ultimately the show takes the view that it's okay because he's got over it now & she only did it so he'd have the musical talent to play after she died. Even cultural dissonance can't be an adequate explanation for why that was thought a good story arc or why Kousei's mum deserved the character redemption it tries to give her.

All this is in contrast to the comparatively marginal b-plot, the competition between Kousei, Takeshi Aiza & Emi Igawa, where something akin to actual character progression takes place. They begin with Emi & Takeshi harbouring old grudges against Kousei, only for the trio to progress as Kousei rediscovers his passion for music while Aiza & Takeshi move on from simply wanting to stick it to their old rival to aspiring to greatness in their own rights. We get to see progression both through their thoughts & conversations & also their musical performances, not to mention that the more peripheral characters connected to this part of the story actually feel like they have a purpose beyond listening to Tsubaki's boy problems or the like. The main plot really doesn't have anything like that sort of dynamic, which makes sitting through episode after episode of Kousei thinking about his mum or Tsubaki thinking about Kousei all the harder to enjoy because it never feels like it's going anywhere meaningful. The ending doesn't help in that regard either. Without spoiling, it basically reveals that the whole journey we've been on was basically a “romantic” version of Cameron's b-plot in the “One day, One Room” episode of House.

But I'm digressing now. Despite all the problems YliA has I can't say it wasn't watchable. Indeed, many of the problems I had with it are things you have to either take or leave with anime that share the same genre tags. As frustrating as it got, YliA never feels as dragged out as, say, Chihayafuru, & there were moments where the show really did shine as the romantic drama it is supposed to be. There are more episodes than were needed but the finale is both a highpoint & a definitive ending, which is always welcome. The art & animation were fine for the most part & were impressive when it counted, which is all one could ask for. Having reached the end of Kousei & company's journey, I can't say I'd want to watch it again, but nor would I say it wasn't worth watching either. All things considered, perhaps that's enough."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"""To play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable."" - Ludwig Van Beethoven 


Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is about a child prodigy classical pianist named Kosei Arima, who gave up playing due to crippling depression following the death of his mother. Even though he won many competitions back when he was still playing piano, his playing was always very ""by the book"", mechanical, and lacking in passion. This was because of the extremely strict way in which he was trained by his late mother. After hearing the very passionate and innovative performance of a brilliant young violinist named Kaori Miyazono,
                  ...
Kosei is able to rediscover his love for music and learn to play with heart.

That sounds AMAZING right? An anime musical drama/romance that tells a heartwarming tale and introduces beautiful classical music to a new generation who otherwise wouldn't give it a chance. Why then didn't I rate it a 9 or 10?! I will sadly have to explain.

Firstly, I must say that this series REALLY had potential! Especially for me, since I am a huge fan of classical music. Both of my parents were classical violinists who played in an orchestra. I went in with very high expectations, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. That isn't to say that I felt Shigatsu was a bad anime. Shigatsu is a fine anime, but I am saying it could have been a LOT better and it wasted a tragic amount of potential.

Story: 

Although the basic premise of the story is the stuff of an award winning drama film, the execution was...not so much. Shigatsu has a LOT of really crappy comedy that never once made me laugh and constantly threw the mood out the window! This comedy is almost always accompanied by painfully obnoxious chibi style animation to save on the show's budget. I'm not saying that using tone jarring chibi out of nowhere instantly makes an anime bad. Hellsing Ultimate did it for comedy scenes, but Hellsing Ultimate never took itself seriously and never expected the audience to take it seriously. It is a show about Count Dracula fighting Nazi vampires! Shigatsu on the other hand, tries REALLY hard every 5 seconds to make the audience cry. Shigatsu DOES take itself quite seriously and wants to really emotionally move the audience, so the use of shitty comedy and random chibi in this context was a rather poor choice. The other most obvious problem in the show's execution was just how forced a lot of the tragedy felt. Shigatsu is a flat out melodrama. I'm not one of those critics who instantly hates on melodrama and condemns series just for using a writing style that is no longer in vogue. However, this story really didn't need to be a melodrama. It felt completely tacked on unnecessarily. Tragedies get more respect than comedies right? We better try REALLY hard to make this into a tragedy! I love a good tragedy, but Shigatsu in terms of its themes, message, and basic story isn't really crafted to be a tragedy. It feels like a comedy that was forcibly changed into a tragedy in post production because some jackass thought it would win more awards! 

Art:

The art and animation is very inconsistent. During the scenes where an instrument is being played, the animation is gorgeous and accurately captures the movements of the musician. Then it goes to barely animated chibi garbage because...why? The art style is extremely ""moe"" which may piss off some viewers.


Music:

The selection of classical music is AWESOME! We get Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and basically lots of excellent pieces by amazing composers. The only problem is the quality of the playing used for the anime's soundtrack. We are told over and over again how Kosei is this AMAZING child prodigy and quite possibly developing into the greatest pianist of his day. Yet the piano playing we hear is...not THAT good. This wasn't a live action film. They could have used any recording since the invention of the phonograph and synced up the animation with the playing. Why not use a recording of a pianist who actually plays like ALL the characters describe Kosei? Vladimir Horowitz could play better than the dude from this soundtrack after 3 bottles of vodka, blindfolded, while being attacked by killer bees!


Overall:

Basically I just wanted to say that Shigatsu wasn't a bad anime, but it really wasn't a new masterpiece and actually squandered a ton of potential with extremely questionable choices in terms of execution. This actually isn't the first time I have seen a ""moe"" melodrama that mixed slapstick comedy with extremely forced tragedy. Angel Beats already accomplished that feat years ago. The difference is that the comedy in Angel Beats was actually funny! Angel Beats was also always supposed to be a comedy, but with some drama and tragedy thrown in. Shigatsu probably started out as a comedy, but was changed into a tragedy first, a romantic drama second, and a loveletter to classical music 3rd. The comedy in Shigatsu  honestly feels WAY more out of place than the comedy in Angel Beats. Overall, I would still check it out if you really love classical music or wish to learn more about classical music, but if you are coming for the drama/romance, I would pick a better anime."

However interested I was at first, even with the outstanding music, at this point I can't even stomach this show. In my opinion, this show puts way too much of an emphasis on the entire drama of everything and kinda distracts from what I think is most important in a good show: an interesting story. Say you're not like me, and you enjoy all this whiny drama stuff. I'd say disregard everything

else I'm about to say and go ahead and watch this, because you'll be sure to enjoy it. However, if all these tears and uncertain moments make you kinda wanna puke, I'd maybe kinda wanna stay away, because you'll only end up distraught and dissatisfied with all the mixed emotions in a show like this."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"""Will you forget?"" - Kaori 

Honestly, I have not written an anime review probably since Sword Art Online. I don't necessarily prefer writing reviews cause they're generally tedious & time consuming. However, There is only so long I can see such misleading, disrespectful, and uninformative reviews. Out of the well over 300 anime series I have seen, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is one of Seven anime I have given the perfect score to. And that is because this anime epitomises quality & perfection. 

I came in to this show with moderate expectations. I followed this show weekly - watching it each Thursday as it
                  ...
aired alongside my other Fall 2014 & Winter 2015 shows. Episode after episode continued to raise expectations, to command attention & perpetuate interest. I've seen a relatively fair share of Romance/Drama/School type anime, the most recent one of this genre being ""Nisekoi"" and most falling in a long line of trope filled, generic characters, non-developing story, and non existent romance. 

The first thing you have to judge a show by is its first impression, just like any other art medium. My first impression of Shigatsu was along the lines of ""Wow, this is aesthetically pleasing."" The meticulous attention to detail of backgrounds, artistic displays, character designs was beyond impressive. Even the way A-1 transitioned between Kosei's world of colour & that of black/white played a positive, constructive role into developing not only Kosei's character, but the plot itself. 

The music coincides with the other positive elements of the show to create the stunning masterpiece it is. First and foremost Shigatsu is a music anime & i find some of the criticisms of this not only amusing, but contradictory. OF COURSE, the drama, romance, setting & other plot elements are going to be centred around Kosei and his Piano playing - his fears, his desires, & his inability to overcome that struggle. I thought this would be more obvious to some people who call it melodramatic, or saying the drama is forced, which is rather ironic seeing as all the drama that occurs is relevant to the story & does not feel forced. Anyway I did not intend to deviate from how special the music is. The score is very evenly and appropriately composed, and at points where the emphasis is on the recitals, the music always fits the mood of the show well, and the monologue that occurs during these moments provides invaluable access to the minds of the characters (predominately Kosei) that allow us to resonate not only to the sound of the music being played - but to the intention of the sound. To the tension of that sound - of that meaning reaching its final destination. The hearts of the audience. The hearts of us. 

Did it reach us? - Yes it did.

You can't have a perfect score without characters of the highest calibre. That's where Kaori Miyazano sparkles. She is confident, strong willed, beautiful, motivational, short-tempered, fragile, lonely all at the same time. To me she rates among the best female characters of all time.  Kosei was a little more frustrating at times, and a little more bland. A little more of the generic type, but even when he should feel generic, there is a realness he represents. The struggle he faces, his desires to overcome those struggles, his human emotion - his black and white world that is slowly being transformed to that of colour. Kosei surely wasn't the most spectacular of protagonists - but seeing the once ""puppet to the score's"" transformation both as a person - and as an artist is one of the best coming of age developments in Anime history. Even some of the side characters I particularly grew fond of. The most specific of these is Aiza. Aiza while truly looked up to Kosei  as a hero- as an idol, despite being equally as talented  and prodigious himself. Even looking at Kosei's back, he always strives to catch up to him, to make an impact. Not all of the characters were strong - Watari is the generic best friend who's athletic, good looking, confident, etc & Tsubaki has the archetypal role of being the childhood friend who's in love - but can't realise it. 

When I rate anime, 9 to me represents masterpiece, and 10 represents what i describe as ""beyond masterpiece"". I always say if I have to ""question"" if a show is a ten it is inherently not a ten, So what separates Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from other masterpieces? It's the show's impact. Week in and week out my heart aligned with the characters - aligned with the drama. The aesthetics were unparalleled, the score so diligently composed, the characters so well developed and an ending that catalyses tears from even the most desensitized of viewers. Save for a few moments of misplaced comedic madness, the tone was consistent - the mood always properly developed & accentuated by both the score & art, and the show epitomised the absolute pinnacle of its genre. I loved this show."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Beethoven was a piano genius who couldn’t hear his own music because of his deafness. Arima Kousei is a piano prodigy can’t hear his own music because of the tragic death of his mother causing mental breakdown that casted a deep, dark shadow over music.  

[Story]

Your Lie in April starts out as a colorful, and lighthearted anime, but all this contrasts the life of it’s main character, Arima Kousei, which is described as monotone, and dull. The lightheartedness is contradicted yet again as deeper, and much darker past is revealed as Arima falls deeply in love with Kaori. You get a large glimpse of
                  ...
his dismal past revealing the actual reason behind why he can’t hear his own music, but his conditions steadily improves as he ventures into his first love. Though only calling him “Friend A” Kaori slowly begins to drag him back into music, as well as showing him a new side of life that was colorful, and vivid. 

I enjoyed the story as well the storytelling methods of Shigatsu. The story is told mostly through Kosei’s point of view, and the anime utilizes a unique way of narration, much of the story is told through internal monologues, and thoughts. There are several pros and cons of this method, and a pro is the fact that you can see the character’s thought processes, and the con is that too much monologues can be quite overwhelming as well as annoying at times.  

[Characters]

One of the things that made this anime so great was the characters. The anime heavily centers in on the past of the characters, which proves to be an excellent way of characterization. Every single character in the anime no matter substantial or minor is given a great personality. And as far as character development goes, most of the main characters display a considerable amount of it, especially Kousei. 

I really enjoyed diversity between the personalities of Kousei, and Kaori. Kaori seemed like the incarnation of freedom, a happy go lucky girl. Yet Kousei is a sheltered person, he seems to withdraw himself from others in order to protect himself. They were polar opposites of each other, yet they were also made to be together.

[Sound]

Amazing put together, the soundtrack to the anime emphasized every aspect of the anime making it so much better. I’m definitely no fan of classical music but, they were essential to the show, as to any music anime, and it turned out I really enjoyed them because the songs were part of the story. Each time Kosei performed a song it revealed to us a little bit of his past. As a person who always skips the OP and ED of an anime, I made the exception for this one since they all were so well written, and complemented the tone of the anime. 

[Art & Animation] 
Original, would be the word I would use to describe the type of art style in the anime. Personally I thought it was okay but it was fairly compatible with the show, it used a lot of vibrant colors which thoroughly emphasized a lighthearted mood. 

[Negatives] 
No show is perfect, and this show is no exception. Not really sure why people had such a big problem with the overly dramatic scenes but it’s true there were a lot of drama, especially towards the end. Personally I thought the drama made the show more realistic, but honestly do a couple of 14 year olds need that much drama.

Pacing, one thing I learned after watching this anime was that the author really likes to drag things out, and I understand that this might not be a problem for some people, but honestly, do they really need to spend a whole episode on the past of a supporting character? I really wish they would’ve made the last part of the show longer rather than adding in too much detail. 

[Overall]

I really enjoyed this anime as a whole, it took a very clichéd plot, and with it’s added elements turned it into something original. And taking it’s genre’s into perspective, it really excels at each of them except the humor it could’ve been done a lot better. The jokes were poorly placed and overall just caused awkwardness. The anime is a real tearjerker it made me cry twice, and I pride myself in being a real macho person. But as far as masterpieces go, this definitely belongs in the best of the best. It’s an anime that I wished would never end, but nothing lasts forever, except true love."

Note: I am no english speaker

Note: Finished the serie. It got better, I'll admit but 3 worth episodes do not compensate the whole shitness of the anime.

""Your lie in April""? More like ""Your overrated anime in April"". Am I right?!

*Awkward silence*

...
Let me start off by saying this: I did not enjoy Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. 

As you can imagine I, being a classical music enthusiast and a big fan of Clannad (although some reviewers would have a word on that), was pretty excited about this anime and along with the hype I went and I watched it...as long as I could take it...

Let's start off with the production value. Here is where Shigatsu really stands out. The art is amazing and the backgrounds are simply breathtaking. The animation is also great specially when the characters are playing their instruments as you can see the tears, the sweat and the facial expressions borned from the joyness of music. 
Then we have the music. I already said that I love classical music, and I surely have loved that this anime had classical music. The only scenes with high quality music where the ones with the characters on the scenario. Then everything else was kinda dead silent and no real music to go along. Pretty dissapointing, but I guess I must give a high score just for those scenes alone. I have no comments on the voice acting, as I watched subbed and we all know that doesn't fail.

Let's go with the story so I can start throwing shit here and there.
""Oh! He is in love with a cute girl! Oh! The girl is his best friend's girlfriend! That was so not predictable! Oh! His girl friend loves him in secret but he doesn't have a clue that also so not predictable! Oh! The girl he loves has a medical condition that so original!""
Yeah, that's pretty much about it...
There are three things that really bother myself about this anime. First of all is the comedy. It was hard enough for me to get into a tragic and dramatic scene, and then they totally kill the mood with crappy comedy? That's a huge backstab for any viewer. It wasn't the comedy that was bad, but it was so misplaced. You know what? Forget that, the comedy was bad indeed. But specially the bad timing they had for those shitty jokes. How do you expect me to be sensitive when suddenly you totally change the scene's mood?
Secondly every character cries for fucking everything. I mean come on. I get Kousei with his mom, but they cry for every fucking thing. Got a concert tomorrow? Better cry instead of practicing. You want to ask one of your best friends to be you partner? Cry, that totally does not look awkward. You see a cat on the street? Better have a heart attack. I understand that drama is necessary in an anime of this nature but Jesus Christ this was plain stupid. Lastly, the premise was really really REALLY good, and it had two strong plotlines to hold to in order to make this a brilliant anime. On one hand the relationship between Kousei and his mother (as many artists and athletes have that kind of relationship with their parents) had a lot of potential for character development and deep psychological struggle. On the other hand we had the rivalries between Kousei, Takeshi and Emi (by far the best characters) that could have become an AMAZING plot-motor, as we could have seen their egos in epic classical music battles. But what did we got instead? Crappy romance triangles with no real development and boo-boo teen angst. Including a romance for the sake of the story could have been nice but my god what a way to fuck things up.
I'll admit that the last episodes were good because A) they kinda cut that shitty comedy B) theyfocused more on the concerts and the actual music and C) Kaori gets less screen-time.

Now this, leads me to the final and most important part: the characters. I liked Kousei a lot. He was well developed he was an interesting character and his struggle and emotions seemed the most natural and realistic of all the cast. I also liked Emi and Takeshi as Kousei's rivals but they get no screen-time nor development to be considered other things than fillers. The rest of the cast was plain, boring and overall a big ""meh"" with two exceptions.
I strongly dislike Tsubaki. Considering all the screen-time she had and the ""development"" she got (if we can call that development) it is infuriating how balnd, stupid and boring of a character she turned out to be. Really though, what the heck is she for the story? She serves no purpose and she is not even ebtertaining to watch.
And last but not least, Kaori. By far, the most bland, obnoxious, stupid and unrealistic female MC I've seen lately. Sorry I was wrong.She is not a character, she is a mere plot device. She is there just to inspire Kousei to play music. She is annoying everything she does is stupid and a forced overreaction and OH MY GOD WHY THE FUCK DOES SHE HIT HIM SO MUCH? They tried to make a cool badass tsundere like Asuka and instead they got a pile of shit with blonde hair and no real purpose on the story. Also, why they decided to throw her development as a big ball of blandness into the last episode? If I knew all that during the series progression she would have been a better character.

So...that's about it. That's my rant for this ani-meh. Shigatsu had a lot of potential. Kousei development was great. The music scenes were amazing. The relationship between him and his mother was splendid. The art and animation were outstanding. But they decided to throw all that away just to please the casuals with a bad romantic-drama-comedy-slice of life. It could have worked as a 12 episodes romantic anime, but stretching it for so long made it unbearable."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"Prepare yourself for a musical ride with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie In April), one of the most talked about anime in the western community of late. The big question is whether the music-focused romance has earned its acclaim we’ve seen from the bulk of reviewers? I feel it’s both a yes and no, but mostly the latter. That’s not to take away from it at all. This artful, musical adventure is still better than your average anime by a long way and it’s still a show I’d encourage everyone to watch if they get a chance.

It is one gorgeously crafted anime from
                  ...
a technical perspective. While its animation doesn’t leap out at you, the character designs, background art and music are superb. Every scene is oozing with charm. The show is not, however, free from its flaws which come mostly from the character interactions, comedy and strange writing choices that plague the show particularly in its back half. There is no doubting that the show will be remembered for a long time in the genre thanks to its wonderful blend of art, music and sprightly collection of characters. It’s not flawless, by a long shot, but it will manage to reach you somewhere on the emotional spectrum through either its uplifting moments or its sadder periods.

The story itself is simple enough. We have our protagonist Kousei who is a former child prodigy on the piano but has since lost both his desire and ability to play due to events in his life. Along comes Kaori into his life, a blond-haired ball of energy, who suddenly puts the colour back into his life and sparks his journey back into the musical sphere. There’s no themes in here you haven’t seen before but the way they are conveyed is full of life and charm. Though it borders on the overbearing when it comes to dialogue the story trundles along with a decent pace throughout the episodes, perhaps dragging along at moments. Could it have been done over 12 episodes instead? Possibly.

The show’s biggest flaw comes from its handling of the relationship between our two main characters Kousei and Kaori. It’s hard to delve into this without spoiling the story and their development but I will say a few things on the topic. 

First, the not-so-good news. A combination of some dreadfully unfunny and poorly timed comedic breaks, repetitive dialogue, slow progression and also exposition overload with the duo always kept me frustrated as a viewer. A lot has been said about the lengthy amount of philosophical ramblings of the characters, and it must be said that the problem with them doesn’t come with the words being spouted from a 14-year-old’s mouth. Instead, the problem comes in that such monologues are in stark contrast to the wacky comedic moments. The show really has no idea what kind of tone it’s going for because of this conflict. The show could have done without both the philosophical and comedic moments and struck a friendly middle ground that could still have produced a concentrated script.

The other side of the coin is that, on their own, I feel like our leading pair are very interesting. They have desires and they change as our story progresses. As they each help them find out more about themselves and their own ability we start to see new sides of them. This is true more so in Kousei’s case as Kaori remains criminally underdeveloped at points. Nothing in the show, I feel, is worthy of the dreaded ‘melodramatic’ tag. All the decisions made revolving around their music make sense, plus the emotional baggage they carry is certainly not unfounded. It’s great to see Kousei try to fight through the barriers preventing him from playing without fear once again. The way he tries to achieve that makes perfect sense and is handled with respect and – to a point – realism.

In regards to our other characters, it seems all their purpose in the show is to further Kousei’s development without expanding their own a great amount. That’s not to say they don’t have their moments. Tsubaki and Watari are the friends tagging alongside our leading duo and they provide a welcome change up sometimes. Their own successes and failures are utilised well by the writers as a parallel to what our leads are going through. They certainly don’t just sit by the wayside achieving little.

While a central theme of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is its classical music and how it is used to express emotion, it commits the big sin of telling instead of showing. It's disappointing to see a show that is supposed to be letting the music speak to us instead have its message spit out to us in lengthy monologues from those both playing and listening to it. Music has the ability to speak to us through its expression and dynamics. There is supposed to be no better example of this than classical piano. Shigatsu manages to capture this through its artistic elements like its beautiful light and art and also its depiction of the playing styles between our different characters. However these moments become fractured and tainted to an extent due to the constant spilling of thoughts from our characters.

This nit picking, to a point. Every musical scene is packed with energy and also seems to be where the majority of the animation budget would be poured into for the show. The song choices are fantastic and do a superb job at mirroring the current state of the person playing it. It would be most accurate to describe all of Kousei’s performances as a means of concluding an ‘arc’ or development for him. We see him either grow or recede in his confidence in himself each time and, as stated above, the art and direction manage to capture these changes wonderfully.

On another music note the opening and endings are all wonderful and perfectly encapsulate the themes that the show is going for. Goose House’s Hikaru Nara is the big highlight with its energetic vibe and singalong chorus, it’s without a doubt one of the best openings I’ve had the pleasure of listening to.

Overall Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a show that I feel everyone should experience. Some may be able to look past the bloated dialogue and the sketchy writing, instead uncovering a colourful and vibrant show that manages to give off plenty of charm through its music and superb art. More than anything – despite the flaws I see – the show will stick with you. There will be moments you look back on with either fondness or sadness some time from now."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"They say that when you fall in love, your whole world changes. The grey becomes colored, the dull becomes vivid, and the little moments become unforgettable ones. While there may be other stories that are written better or other productions that are animated better, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) struck a chord with me that I hadn’t felt with a show in a long time. Even with its flaws, I loved every moment of this show, both as a musician and as an ordinary viewer. 

Shigatsu focuses on the journey of Arima Kousei, who was a brilliant pianist as a child,
                  ...
but is now just a shell of his former self, haunted by the tragedies of his past. However, one day in April he meets Kaori Miyazono, the wild and unorthodox violinist, and that meeting sets off the beginning of Kousei’s journey as Kaori drags him out forcefully to confront himself. While there’s nothing especially groundbreaking about the premise, I felt it was executed in such a way that made the journey engaging and got me invested in the lives of the characters. The story’s lighthearted moments were very enjoyable, bar a bit of repetitiveness in the slapstick comedy, while the tragic moments made me sympathize and mourn alongside the characters. Some may say that the show was a bit overdramatic, but I’d have to disagree. The emotional plights that seem trivial to an outsider have much more weight to growing adolescents, and that is something I could definitely empathize with. On the other hand, the stress and despair that the musicians feel leading up to their performances may not be understandable to the casual player, but to those with a real investment in music, it is very real. I felt that the drama was well done and raised the tension in such a way that made the stakes at cost feel present. Also, I’m glad that they committed to their ending and didn’t kind of half-way attempt it but then turn tail because they were too afraid of committing *cough* Oreimo *cough*. It made the ending feel much more satisfying, which sadly is not the case for many shows.

One complaint that some might have with the show and that I’d be able to understand is that it’s a little heavy-handed. With an abundance of monologues containing flowery, Shakesperian-esque dialogue as well as not-so-subtle symbolism, it probably would’ve been to their benefit to have toned it down a little and made it a bit more subtle. While it might be too much for some, I personally didn’t really have too much of an issue with it, but it was noticeable. It could also be a little slow at times, but other than one especially noticeably repetitive episode, it wasn’t too big of a problem.

 A part of the show that I enjoyed immensely was watching the musicians grow. From the climb out of despair in Kousei or just the small steps as a musician in the young Nagi, seeing all the musicians grow up on their own journeys both musically and emotionally was extremely satisfying to watch. The rest of the cast were a bit more stagnant, but they were still enjoyable characters nonetheless. Watari was a bit of the typical male best friend character and didn’t really grow through the series, but was still fun to watch. Tsubaki didn’t really grow much either for most of the series, but when the time came around where everyone realized just how fleeting time is, she was able to do more than just the typical childhood friend character, and I appreciated that. The characters felt like more than just two dimensional people, leading me to grow invested and care about their lives.

Now, there was some slight controversy surrounding the show, mostly involving Kaori’s forcefulness with Kousei, as well as Tsubaki and Watari to a lesser degree. While it’s certainly not going to be the same case for everybody, and there are probably hundreds of different methods that could have been used, I feel as though Kaori’s push isn’t as wrong as some people think. I may not have gone through the same circumstances that Kousei did, nor was my despair ever as great as his, but I think that I can empathize with Kousei’s mindset. And if it was me, I definitely would’ve needed to have had someone else push me, even if it hurt, to ever have a chance of finding a way out, so I feel as though the story’s take on the situation wasn’t wrong. Of course, some people may have different opinions, and I respect that, but that’s my personal take on the matter.

On the artistic side of things, it was a beautiful show to look at. The art style was pleasing, and the animation was mostly fluid; they also had some gorgeous stills too. The color palette changed to fit the emotions as well as the livelihood of a certain character, so that was a nice touch. There were times that the animation cut the corners a little in a way that you could tell, but it was never anything too prominent. The soundtrack was nice and fitting, with the everyday moments feeling pleasant while the dramatic ones being accentuated with the emotional music. I loved both OP’s, although Hikaru Nara edges it out slightly for me, while both ED’s fit nicely with the tone, with the second one more somber than the first to fit with the growing tragedy.

Of course, as a show about musicians, the performances had to be good. And they were absolutely amazing. The performances were extremely engaging, and after every single one, I noticed that I hadn’t moved an inch during the whole thing. They were animated beautifully, and the emotions in the music captivated me as a viewer. As a musician, watching these performances reignited a love for classical music I had forgotten for a long time, and it’s stirred me to expand my repertoire to more than just contemporary music. As a side note, I’m extremely glad that they finally didn’t have a violinist just flailing around the bow like they’re playing the music even though it doesn’t match what’s playing at all. As a former violinist it would grate my eyes whenever I saw that in a show, but thankfully this one avoids doing just that. 

Maybe it’s just because I’m a teenager and a musician so I can relate with the characters, but this is a show that captivated me in a way that anime hasn’t done in a long time. While it may have had some flaws, the character journeys, the tragic moments alongside the lighthearted ones, the performances, and the energy of the show all just came together to create a show that was extremely enjoyable from beginning to end. 

""Are you going to forget? Even if I die, I won't forget.""

tl;dr – I liked it. A lot."

Shigatsu is an anime that had me torn in so many places. I think the plot , the music and the artwork are the best you will see recent memory. That said, the melodrama between the big events of the series is absolutely excruciating to watch especially for a modern anime. I had to constantly remind myself that the main characters are junior high students and not high school students to give some meaning to the unrealistic drama that unfolded. I will describe why I feel that this melodrama was so horribly written and executed
                  ...
and why I feel it ruined an incredible piece of art that is Shigatsu.

 The ""lie"" is supposed to be a plot device that allows Arima to have mixed feelings and give him a drive. 
This worked out fine story wise but to introduce that type of background and never work with it was annoying to say the least. I really feel I could argue that this was made so that ""romance"" could be injected into a musically focused story. Normally this type of relationship would be questioned. We never experience that thrill of someone finding out. Later in the series Watari openly comments on other cute girls with no remorse or guilt or obligatory anime slap to the face. This brings another issue with the series which is my main dealbreaking issue. Anytime there is a problem all you have to do is beat the shit out of Kosei,
Kaori messes something up,attack  Kosei, another girl shows affection to Kosei, attack him for it,
Kosei does all the work and takes no credit, attack him for it, 
Kosei suffers from depression due to trama, help him by attacking him, 
Kosei does his absolute best given the circumstances, beat the shit out of him
I don't know if this was supposed to funny but it was the most irritating I ever watched. I started to question anime in general because of this series. 

There was so much they could have done instead of attacking Kosei.   I wanted more from this anime. The art work caught my eye immediately with eye popping colors that were so vivid on an OLED screen and an excellent repertoire of classical music.  Character development felt very forced as most anime do with a beta male main character. 
This anime could of been a must see classic if the writer had been more mature about it but now it's a just a good watch for people who like music anime with a little romance. Don't watch this anime for the romance like I did. just enjoy the ride and try not to think about it."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"It would seem that feeling some modicum of emotional involvement whilst watching/reading something is all it takes to make a masterpiece these days. Whilst emotional involvement is always a great thing, it's not enough to excuse problems that a particular work in question has. On another note, it irks me when people say they ""got the feels"" from watching something because more often than not, it was something stupid/cliché/melodramatic. Maybe I'm a heartless sociopath or maybe it's because I've been through a lot worse in life, but I can't help but scoff when people tell me they cried like a baby whilst watching stuff like
                  ...
the first season of Clannad. Then enters Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, an anime/manga series that plagues me with cognitive dissonance because there's a lot of stuff I truly do like about this programme but there's also a LOT of irritating crap that just got on my nerves.

The biggest reason as to why I got emotionally involved with Shigatsu is because of Kousei himself. Like I've said in some of my other reviews, my mother's dead and I know damn well where Kousei's at and all that stuff. To me, Shigatsu was less about the music and more about the story of a teenager learning to move on from past tragedies. Add into the mix that I'm a huge fan of romantic drama and music, and you'd basically have a recipe for something that would've been among my all-time favourites (alongside the likes of White Album and Solanin). Unfortunately, it wasnt perfect. The gag comedy was a mild annoyance that gradually turned into something cringe-worthy, the monologuing was a bit tedious and it just got even more ridiculous as the show went on, and as these two aspects of the show became more obvious, I found myself getting less and less involved with what was going on. If you're an avid fan of this show, allow me to explain myself.

I understand that levity has a place in storytelling, and what's more is that this show is aimed toward a mainstream audience that probably can't handle the intensity of things like Gong Ji-young's Our Happy Time or White Album 2. The problem is that Shigatsu's particular style of humour was grossly inappropriate for the subject matter that this show was tackling. This is a show revolving around a 14-year-old who has a dead mother who was extremely abusive toward him learning how to cope with past tragedies and learning to move on with his life. The last thing we need is a chibi-style cutaway interspliced with every dramatic moment out there. Stuff like that just takes away from the emotional impact of the story and just ruins the mood for me. If the humour was more dialogue-oriented like in Daria or in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics, it would've been more than enough to break up the excess tension that would build up and make the show uncomfortable to watch whilst also allowing for the show to play with your emotions without any interference whatsoever. Alack, hindsight's an anime studio's worst enemy and there's no changing what's already done.

On another note, the monologuing was nothing short of tedious and insulting. Monologues are a powerful tool and if used sparingly, they can strengthen the impact of various events that would go on in your story. The problem is that the mangaka (and A-1 Pictures by extension) fails to understand that more monologues does NOT equate to more emotional weight. I don't know about you, but I find it nothing short of insulting when an anime studio decides to tell us exactly what a character is feeling via long, drawn-out monolgues in almost every episode because it gives me the impression that A-1 Pictures thinks I'm some socially inept otaku with no understanding of how human emotions work. The strange thing is that all of the monologuing could've easily been omitted if the story actually decided to focus on Kousei and Kaori instead of bringing up the perspectives of people like Kousei's piano rivals and Tsubaki.

I don't know about you, but I don't give a rat's ass about Tsubaki, Watari, Emi, Takeshi, or any of those other people. They're side characters, so why even bring them up? The only characters that ultimately matter by the end of it all are Kousei and Kaori. All that time that A-1 Pictures spent on those characters could've easily been spent making fleshing out Kousei and Kaori's personalities. As much as I adore the two of them, I can't exactly say that I think they''re well-written characters. Let me put it to you like this: I've found several other characters empathetic in the same way I found myself empathising with Kousei (i.e. Tohru Honda, Tomoya Okazaki, Shinji Ikari) and yet those characters made more of a lasting impression in my mind than Kousei did, namely because I found them empathetic in many more ways than I could find myself relating to Kousei. I mean, outside of the fact that I was once a motherless teenager with the hots for a blonde chick, I can safely say that Kousei isn't exactly the most relatable of individuals. As for Kaori? Well... outside of the fact that I actually like her, she's no different than Nagisa from Clannad in that they're just there to be plot devices meant to evoke an emotional response out of the viewer.

Now those problems aside, another thing that never really sat right with me was how Kousei was treated by his friends over the course of the series. He's got a dead mother who was pretty damn abusive toward him. The last thing the bloke wants to do is play the piano, and yet he still finds himself drawn to it because you know... that was his thing. I understand his friends want him to just play the bloody instrument again and that 14-year-olds aren't psychotherapists by any stretch of the imagination, but the way they go about doing so is rather cruel to say the least. He's harassed and manipulated quite a bit over the course of the series and somehow, that's the solution to all of his problems. You know, Kousei would've had a mental breakdown if he was a real person because he'd be forced to re-live some nasty childhood trauma. I wouldn't really have much of a problem with this were it not for the fact that I've seen shit like this first-hand, and it *RARELY* works out. It also doesn't help that there was a lot of inappropriate gag comedy that was going on during these scenes where Kousei was forced to play the piano again, but let's not get into that.

I really don't want to pick on this show so much, but the problem is that these flaws make the show incredibly difficult to take seriously. When I get taken out of my moment by flaws in a particular programme, my critical faculties are automatically turned on and now I have no choice but to take the piss out of the show I'm watching because it failed to keep me entertained in the first place. This means that stuff I would've ordinarily let slide if I were actually invested in what I was watching (i.e. the simpering, stupid dialogue about ""seeing the notes"" and ""colourful music"") end up being another point lost in my book. If this were any other programme (like say Tokyo Ghoul or Fate/stay night), this wouldn't be a problem because half the fun in watching them came from making fun of what was going on in the show. However, Shigatsu falls in with Nagi no Asukara in that it was a show that I adored the crap out of that gradually lost my interest because of various factors (much to my own dismay, of course).

A lot of these problems could've easily been avoided if A-1 Pictures actually took the initiative to fix the problems that the source material had in the adaptation. An adaptation isn't supposed to be a translation of the source material verbatim into another medium. Adaptations can be viewed as a sort of ""second chance"" for the source material, so the most important job that an adaptation has to do is fix the various problems that plagued the source material in the first place. Unfortunately, that didn't happen whatsoever and the end result is a show full of wasted potential, poorly-timed gag comedy, tedious monologues, and a whole lot of farcical melodrama: just like the manga that it came from. Well, that's not entirely fair to say because Shigatsu does have a few redeeming qualities.

For a show that couldn't keep me invested in what was going on for more than five minutes at a time, I must say that the parts where I was actually into what was going on had me on the edge of my seat and despite that Clannad comparison I made earlier, this show actually had me invested in what was going on a lot more than the first season of Clannad could ever hope to. Despite the fact that the show is plagued with bad comedy, laughably pathetic melodrama, and annoying monologues, there will come a powerful scene every so often that would've otherwise left you in tears were it not for the inexcusably flawed execution. On that note, at least Shigatsu did a fair enough job of actually making me care about the characters throughout the entire show as opposed to some of the other things I've watched (i.e. Air, Nagi no Asukara) so it has that going for it as well.

The production values also showcase what A-1 Pictures is capable of from an audiovisual standpoint. Despite the fact that the animation quality hiccups every now and then, it's remarkably consistent and the amount of effort and detail they put into the musical performances makes them all the more captivating to watch. Speaking of music, the OST is lovely to say the least. I personally find myself liking the first OP the most, mostly because it's quirky, catchy, and makes me eager to watch more of the show despite knowing damn well what's in store for me if I do. I would say something about classical music, but I don't got that much knowledge in that department. I like violins and I like pianos. This show has plenty of tracks with violins and pianos and they sound good to my ears. Therefore, the OST is good. What more do you want me to say?

Final thoughts? Well... Shigatsu was definitely something I'll keep in mind for a while and whilst it was tedious to get through, it managed to do more than enough right to get a pass from me. With that said, I wouldn't necessarily call this show ""good"" because honestly... there are so many other things out there that do what Shigatsu does and better. I mean, if you want this particular show, go right ahead but I'd hold off on it for a while and try going for something like say...

a) White Album 2
- Another romantic drama with music that came out during the fall season. This show puts a lot more focus on the romance than the music, and what's more is that it actually keeps a serious tone throughout the eniter story! Kazusa is easily best girl, by the way

b) Clannad: The Motion Picture (and Clannad: After Story to a greater extent)
- Another story about a guy whose life was changed completely after a fateful encounter with a girl in spring. Within the span of an hour and a half, a story of love, loss, and coping with tragedy is told and is done to a much greater effect than it was done in Shigatsu for various reasons (namely the fact that the entire movie was told from Tomoya and Nagisa's perspective).

Yeah, that was a lazy way to shoehorn my alternate show recommendations, but that's what happens when I spend an hour and a half writing up a review for a show that'll probably get downvoted into oblivion anyway. That's all for now though. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"This review has spoilers so if you haven’t watched Shigatsu yet, just scroll down to the bottom for the (spoiler-free) pros and cons section. If you do decide to read all of it, then you’ve been warned, it’s pretty long.


I would start by explaining the plot but I’m sure you know what it’s about by now. If you don’t know, go read it and come back. Did you read it? I don’t know about you but its premise to me sounds amazing. In fact, before Shigatsu aired, I thought it would be the easiest 10 I have ever given a show. However, I was quite
                  ...
wrong and I’ll tell you just how bad this show actually turned out to be.


This is a romance and drama anime, and in shows of these genres the cast of characters is the most important aspect. There’s a lot to say about them but to summarize our cast in just two words, it’d be “mediocre” and “underdeveloped.” There’s honestly not much to say about our MC, Kousei Arima. I liked him most of the time. The only time I felt frustrated with him was when, in one episode, his mom’s ghost finally smiles and it looks like he overcame his fear of playing but a couple of episodes later, he’s back to crying and clutching his head. What happened to all that character development, ehh??? Oh yeah, there was also that one time he said “Kaori’s the only person I need” even though his friends have been with him longer than Kaori has. How can you just ignore your friends like that for some girl you just met? Despite that, he’s the only character who gets a decent amount of development and his outlook on life changes by the end. If you compare how he was at the beginning with how he ended up, there’s definitely a difference. 

Our other MC, Kaori, is one of the worst-written characters I’ve ever come across in any medium. She has no definitive personality and most of the time she’s insufferable. At the beginning she seemed like a nice girl but as it went on, the worse and worse she got. She could be replaced by a cardboard cutout of a VS Pink model with a speech bubble saying “You can do it!” and the show would be 10 times better. She’s just a plot device and because of that, the author forgot to give her a personality. The little bit of personality she DOES have makes no sense and is just all around inconsistent. One second she’s smiling and telling Arima to believe in himself and the next she’s hitting him for no reason. At least in other shows, the tsundere hits the MC because he embarrassed her or made himself look like a pervert, but with Kaori, she hits him for literally no reason. Every time Arima asked angrily “what was that for?!” I was asking myself the exact same thing. Why, Kaori, did you hit Kousei when he did nothing to hurt or embarrass you? Please tell me, I want to know just as much as he does. Kaori also loves to spout philosophical BS that sounds like she got from one of those Tumblr pages filled with filtered photos with “inspirational” text on it that girls like so much. She makes those stupid philosophical speeches many times, too. It’s not endearing, it makes it seem like she’s trying too hard with this “carefree and happy” vibe she’s trying to project. Kaori is also manipulative, proven by the fact that she cried one time to get Kousei to be her accompanying pianist. She could’ve just calmly told him that she admires him (I’m sure he’s quite used to hearing those type of comments) but no, she had to go and cry. And to make her personality even more confusing, there was that one time she asked Kousei out of the blue, “wanna commit double suicide? Nah, just kidding.” Her “personality” is an utter mess. That’s not her only flaw, though. We barely find out anything about her. The only things we know about her is that she likes sweets, cats and that she always wanted to perform with Arima ever since seeing one of his performances when she was little. That’s pretty much it. Her character is confusing, extremely underdeveloped and there’s no way someone like her can exist in real life. I do not understand why people think she is a good character and cry when she dies. She isn’t realistic, relatable or likeable so why do so many people feel sad when she dies? It’s like if you were watching someone kick rocks. Do you cry when you see those poor rocks getting kicked about? Hell no, they’re lifeless rocks. That’s exactly what Kaori dying is like to me. I don’t feel sad or anything because it doesn’t feel like she could be an actual person, as if she’s just some rock.

Tsubaki is another main character and Arima’s childhood friend and as with every “childhood friend” cliché, she likes Arima and boy, does she take forever to realize it. It was absolutely infuriating waiting for her to come to terms with her feelings already. Her chibi comedy bits were unfunny and incredibly annoying. Most of the chibi segments consisted of her yelling nonsense at the people around her. The worst example of those comedy bits being unfunny and just plain disrespectful was when in the last episode, Kousei is reading Kaori’s letter by the train tracks, there’s a sad atmosphere and all, and then Tsubaki shows up uninvited and kicks him in the shin (while looking like a chibi) and yells at him “don’t ever think you’re alone!”  Who thought that was an okay thing to add to that scene??

Watari is Arima’s other friend and another plot device. There are two plot device characters in this show??? Yup. Watari only exists so Kaori and Arima can meet, and Kaori only exists so Arima can feel better again without getting any actual development of her own. Back to Watari. His only traits are: acting like a playboy and liking cute girls and acting like a bro to Arima. Even when he said he liked Kaori (for some reason), Watari just put his arm around Arima’s neck and said “I know.” Watari’s 100% top bro material. Too bad he barely gets any character development, either. There was a scene with him where I felt was the ONLY time I actually related to a character on this show and it was when his soccer team lost a match and he cried over their loss. That’s kind of childish but I’m sure everybody has lost a match or some competition and cried or at least FELT like crying. I could relate to how he was feeling at that moment. However, that’s the only lick of development he gets in the whole show. After that he’s mostly just ignored. 

There are a bunch of supporting characters that are just….there. They don’t add anything to the story nor do their personalities get fleshed out. There’s Takeshi, Arima’s “rival,” whose main traits are: sporting a frown most of the time, acting confident in his piano-playing skills and having one of the most ridiculous hairstyles I have ever seen. Seriously, his hair’s ridiculousness rivals even JP’s from Redline. He would be completely forgettable if it weren’t for his retarded hair. There’s the other “rival,” Emi, who is only there because the author says so. She likes Kousei as well, so I guess her only real purpose is to be the third girl in his little harem. She’s a pretty useless character too. Here’s my problem with Arima’s “rivals”: their “rivalry” doesn’t feel like a rivalry because he doesn’t care about them. Not once, during a competition, did Kousei look at them, acknowledge that they have talent and say “I’m gonna beat you guys!” like actual rivals do. Takeshi and Emi think of Arima as their rival but he didn’t even remember their NAMES when he met them again after their last competition together. It’s a one-sided rivalry and that’s why I put quotation marks around the word “rival,” because Arima himself doesn’t think of them as rivals, he just ignores them most of the time, like their talent is nothing compared to HIS talent. There’s also Nagi, Takeshi’s little sister. She likes to say “what a cliché!” a lot, which is extremely annoying. Even though she only got a couple of episodes in the spotlight, I felt like I understood more of her personality than I understood Kaori’s in the entire show. Arima’s teacher and mother figure, Hiroko, was a pretty nice person and I liked her. She didn’t annoy me and there were no scenes with her where I felt like strangling her. She’s probably the best character in the whole show mainly because there aren’t any glaring flaws in her personality or role. I’m going to talk about one other character that people never mention in reviews: Kashiwagi, Tsubaki’s friend. She had literally the worst character introduction I have ever seen: by not getting introduced. One episode, she’s not there, and the next she’s hanging around Tsubaki and getting screentime. I thought I accidentally skipped an episode when I saw her. We never find out anything about her, she doesn’t do anything to help Arima nor do anything significant of any sort. Heck, she even got a spot in the second OP. But just look at her MAL page. There’s nothing on it. She shows up a lot and there’s no info on her to put on there. 
You see all these supporting characters I talked about? Yeah, all of them are pretty much useless. They don’t have very interesting personalities not did I ever feel like wanting to learn more about them.

Overall, the cast is absolute garbage. None of the characters are interesting and character development is non-existent in this show. Arima was the only one who got even a bit of development while everyone else was ignored. But hey, he’s our main character, he’s the only one that REALLY matters here, amirite?


There is also an insane amount of flashbacks, foreshadowing, deathflags and inner monologues. Even the supporting characters get flashbacks. There are TOO. MANY. FLASHBACKS. The “foreshadowing” was incredibly obvious and made you see the ending coming from a mile away. They even made it seem like Kaori had a chance of living. There was one scene where her doctor tells her that she can have surgery and she decides to have it. This scene brought us false hope, making us think she’ll live, but since we’ve been stuffed to our necks with deathflags, it’s no surprise she ends up dying anyway. In one of the later episodes, Kousei comes out of the hospital (after visiting Kaori) feeling depressed, he sees that the black cat that REPRESENTS KAORI is lying on the street after being run over, dying, and he picks it up and tries to help it but it dies anyway. If that isn’t the most obvious “foreshadowing” ever, I don’t know what it is. It’s not subtle, that’s for sure. The inner monologues are just as annoying as the flashbacks and they show up at the most inappropriate of times: during performances. The most idiotic example of inner monologues interrupting the music being played was in one of Emi’s performances. Instead of hearing the piece she’s playing, what do you hear instead? Emi’s voice in her head exclaiming, “Hibike! Hibike!” Just STFU, Emi, and let me hear the song you’re playing! I hate it when people praise this show for having classical music in it when you can barely hear it. All you hear is the characters’ voices OVER the music.


The “romance” in this show is abysmal. If anything, it’s quite shallow. Kaori started to become interested in Arima after hearing one of his performances (and the reason why I say Kaori was only “interested” in Arima and she didn’t “like” him is because we never find out if she likes him or not. This makes their little romance one-sided), and the only reason why Arima started to like Kaori was because of her violin-playing and her little inspirational speeches. What, does he go falling in love with every one of his therapists, too? Because that’s basically what Kaori is to Arima. There is no romantic development between our two MCs, and they like each other for very stupid reasons. 


One last thing I want to talk about is Kaori’s disease. They NEVER tell us what disease she actually has. It’s like the author just HAD to make her have some sort of disease but didn’t care enough to think about exactly WHAT disease she will have. I have seen people try and GUESS what disease she has based on her symptoms. The very fact that people had to GUESS and that the show never told us is incredibly lazy on the author’s part.


I will talk about the good parts, though. The OPs and EDs were above-average. I even listen to 2 of the songs regularly because I just liked them SO MUCH. I have one complaint, though: the second OP wasn’t as good as the first one (although I still liked it) and it didn’t fit the overall tone of the show in the second half. Luckily, the second ED makes up for the positivity of the OP with a more sad melody, definitely fitting the tone better than the OP. The animation was pretty good and the backgrounds were lovely. The actual animation was pretty solid, for the most part, but sometimes they used still shots during performances, so whenever they did that it just looked lazy. I was quite pleasantly surprised at how the last episode and Kaori’s death played out. The last episode was really well done (except for that one scene with Tsubaki I mentioned earlier). I thought the last episode would have a really depressing tone and lots of crying and screaming from Arima but the atmosphere was actually quite mellow compared to other episodes and there was no crying, either. After Kaori’s death, they skipped the whole grieving process (I’m quite thankful they did that) and moved ahead to a little while after her death when the characters have gotten used to her being gone and have stopped crying. This creates a very peaceful atmosphere. Another thing, Kaori’s “death” scene was actually quite tasteful and special, in a way. The way they showed her “dying” was a pretty good way to show her leaving the world. And that concludes my points on the good parts of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.

As for my personal enjoyment…..there was none. At the beginning I quite liked it but the more it went on the more I hated it. I didn’t ENJOY watching these kids deal with their problems. If anything, I feel only pity towards these characters, living in that sorry little world of theirs.

****************************************************************

Pros 
+ Above average OPs and EDs
+ Good animation 
+ The last episode was well done

Cons
- Characters are unrelatable, boring and underdeveloped
- Lots of useless characters
- Foreshadowing was incredibly obvious, completely ruining the ending 
- Too many flashbacks and inner monologues 
- The slapstick chibi parts weren’t funny and uncalled for at times
- Terrible “romantic” development
- Performances kept getting interrupted by inner monologues, not allowing you to actually hear the music being played


For those that haven’t watched Shigatsu yet: if you like classical music, don’t watch this because you can’t even hear the music anyway. If you like romance, don’t watch this because it’s not romantic in the least. If you like watching realistic and interesting characters, then DON’T. WATCH. THIS. Don’t even watch it for any of the pros I listed. Just look up the OPs and EDs on youtube and save yourself some time. Don’t watch it for the last episode because it’s in no way worth suffering through 21 other episodes to watch, and if you’re watching it for the animation then you’re watching anime wrong. None of the pros I listed are worth picking this show up to watch.


I gave this show a 2 because there is NOTHING about this show that could’ve saved it. I couldn’t even find anything about the characters or story that was actually good. The only reason why I didn’t give it a 1 was because I loved the opening and ending songs, but that’s it. This show is garbage and it’s not even worth the salary of the animators who made it. It is horrifying that so many people think that this show is good simply because it made them CRY. Just because it made you cry doesn’t mean it’s a good anime, it just means you’re a huge baby who gets attached to cardboard cutout characters easily. I’m probably the biggest crybaby I know and I couldn’t even FORCE myself to cry at the end. It is a disgrace that better shows such as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei and Uchouten Kazoku get rated lower than this turd."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"WARNING!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!
Did it reach me? Well, in some parts.
Let's just say that Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a very over-rated series. I understand why people say it's so great, because ""omg, the art is amazing, the music is amazing, the end is so sad, oh no, i cried so much, best ever 10/10"" Ok. The art was beautiful. The only word to describe the art in KimiUso is beautiful. I have not seen music being played animated so beautifully, since Free did that with swimming. The character design fit the characters perfectly. The music was also tip-top, as to expect from a
                  ...
music anime. I loved all the opening and ending themes, with an exception for the 1st ED, which for some reason, didn't buy me. Plot.... I was fine. I guess. The ""deliquent, who meets a girl and suddenly his life starts to change"" motive is used very, very frequently, and KimiUso does not outstand the schemes. I'm not gonna go into the story, cos I'm pretty darn sure all of you know it all by heart. The plot was fine, but I feel the ending, the sad, dramatic ending, was a bit rushed, and so was the progress of Kaori's illness. I felt that literally in the moment she and Kousei went on stage together, she went into hospital and STAYED THERE. And that, my friends, is a big shame, 'cos I was really looking forward to seeing more of Kousei and Kaori on stage together. Fun fact: after watching this anime, I started wanting to play the violin. Like, really bad.
The biggest disappointment in KimiUso was the characters. I want to discuss that a little more deeply.
Arima Kousei
 A heart-warming, good person, who didn't deserve the tragedy he got. I admit, he was a bit of a coward, sometimes annoying, but he was such a good guy! The one thing I loved about the characters in KimiUso was their reaction to Kaori's death, even Kaori herself. But Kousei, even though he was heart-broken, even if he was sad and wanted to cry and scream: he didn't. Because he was a musician. Because Kaori taught him, that he was a musician. And I liked that better than the situation in Clannad:After Story, whereas Tomoya had a mental breakdown and depression after losing Nagisa. And as much as I liked Clannad better than KimiUso, I can't not say that Kousei acted better than Tomoya. And they were in a really similar situation. Anyways, for the wonderful development and his kindness, Kousei gets a 8/10.
Miyazono Kaori
Ah, Kaori. Haven't had such mixed feelings towards a character since Kushieda Minori from Toradora. One one hand, I hated, HATED Kaori. She had the predispositions to be my favorite character, but she killed them before the end of the first episode. Her personality was bitchy and annoying, and the titular ""lie"" she told was really stupid. I mean, she really wasn't the sort of girl who'd do that! But on the other... I absolutely adored her reactions to her illness and the fact she knew she was going to die. Opposite from Hazel from TFIOS, who got all depressed after finding out she was gonna die. Not Kaori! Knowing she didn't have much time, she did all the things she wanted to do in life, just to do them! To gain experience! That motivated me in so many ways. But, for the reasons earlier mentioned, Kaori gets  6/10
Sawabe Tsubaki
People hate Tsubaki- And I'm no exception! I think she was the most hated anime character of 2014, starring alongside Seryuu Ubiquitous. She was annoying, selfish, and just simply STUPID! She, like all of the ""main"" characters except Kaori and Kousei did not get any development and at times I even wondered why she's even there. 4/10
Watari Ryota
Aww, Watari! Pal, you are so under-rated! I loved you! And that is the thing with Watari: he deserved and could have had amazing development, but did not. Even still, I loved Watari. He gets a solid 7/10
Overall, KimiUso isn't a bad series. It just had so much wasted potential. Neverthless, it was touching. It was enjoyable. And it deserves a score of 6-7 but not higher and not lower. 7 is a high as it gets, really."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"There is much bitterness in life, but we have to learn that we must forget that and keep go on. Just like a rainbow in the rain, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso ends beautifully.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a story about Kousei Arima, a piano prodigy who is quite famous at his young age thanks to his mother who introduced him to the world of piano. Arima dominates all competitions he participated because of his perfect performance. One day her mother died. Arima feels shocked since then and got some sort of trauma that makes him unable to play the piano again. Kousei gave
                  ...
in to the world of music until one day he meets a young violinist girl named Miyazono Kaori who introduced Kousei the true meaning of music. 

One of the oldest art forms in the earth is music, music has become a friend of mankind since the beginning of civilization. But what exactly is the meaning of a music? What causes sound was very interesting to listen to? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has the right answer for it. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso prove that music was meant more widespread than we think, not just a set of joyful sound but can mean different - depending on one's own thoughts.

If we look deeper into the story, the concept of the story is not too complex but not too simple either, which makes the story more easily accepted. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also has advantages in the individual elements of the story, though sometimes the comedy is a bit flat. The anime also success in delivering expressive situation, you can feel the intense drama though sometimes looks too hyperbole and exaggerating. 

One of the things that makes a lot of people become difficult to enjoy this anime is the pacing. The pacing is very slow with many flashbacks to appear, it might make you not stand with this movie and feel bored if you not yet accustomed to watching this kind of setting. But this is not a deficiency, the slow pacing makes the story more visible so that there is no stiffness in its delivery. The process is visible and the results are quite satisfactory.

The animation owned by Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is wonderful and suitable, the background illustrated in great details with a different feeling. Different in every scene, could be seen shining and beautiful color, and can also be dark with despair surrounding it. When playing the piano, the animation sometimes turns into CG. Character design very represents and match with the story.

What can I say about the sound settings? One word to describe … “Wonderful”. OP / ED theme is nice & and matched with the mood of the story. Also, the classical instruments of the performance are also nice & expressive with many different feeling.  The seiyuu did their work fairly well in bringing the character to the screen.

In terms of deepening the characters Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is not less than any other anime. The number of flashbacks in the story makes the main character (Kousei) illustrated very clear and very deep as well, a massive character development occurs in Kousei, it is the main success as well.

Besides Kousei, we have Kaori which has a considerable role in encouraging Kousei to plunge into the world of music again, Kaori takes a great role in the 2nd half of the series as well. Some development is also found in the other main characters, such as Tsubaki. Characters with the weakest development are entirely Watari appeared only to meet the needs of the plot alone. Some of the side characters like Aiza Takeshi & Emi Igawa have their own proper development.

For the enjoyment, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also quite entertaining with all the advantages and disadvantages. Fans Slice of Life must watch this anime, also, if you are looking for an anime with strong character development & great dramatic storyline, you come to the right place. In the end, this anime is a true color spectrum that all of the story aspects with rainbows and light that they have. It is really a real deal."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Your lie in April is my favorite show of all time. Beautiful, inspiring, wonderful.

The characters of Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono will likely stick with me forever. Kousei is an immediately tragic character. His inner monologues give him a characterization that show someone who is withdrawing from the world in order to protect himself. Seeing how he progresses throughout the story is one of the best things about Your lie in April. And showing a wisdom far beyond her age alongside a bright perspective on life and music, Kaori is absolutely inspiring. The words she says to Kousei help to bring him back into the
                  ...
world, but some of her knowledge may actually be words to the audience as well. 

Using the love of classical music as a backdrop gives the often introspective characters a place where ""music might just transcend words."" The classical music is absolutely wonderful. The moment that the first performance begins in episode two was the moment that I was hooked on this show. AS the show progresses, the classical music becomes more and more incredible leading up to what has become my favorite classical piece.

In many ways, the classical music is the star of the show, but the heart is in it's coming of age story. Showing an honest side to first loves, dealing with loss, and growing up, Your lie in April's story is an absolute wonder to behold. From the exhilarating highs of the story, to the very tear-jerking moments, Your lie rarely manages to skip a beat. (Seriously, bring a tissue box, you will likely need one)

It's not perfect of course. The humor sometimes seems out of place, and the characters sometimes feel a bit older than they are supposed to be, but even with these very minor flaws, Your lie in April is phenomenal. 

Early in the show one character remarks that the people watching their performance will never forget what they saw that day. As lame as it sounds, I don't think that I'll ever forget this show. It is, in my mind, a masterpiece."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not RecommendedFunnySpoiler,"Warning: I wrote this unhinged rant four years ago because this crappy show infuriated me so much. Enjoy.  

I have never seen a more disgusting anime that covers itself in as much sugar as Your Cuck in April. It touches on as many delicate themes with the sensitivity of a sledgehammer, like depression, abuse, and terminal illness.

Your Lie in April tells the story of Kousei, a pianist who was abused by his mother when he was a child, and in the present day, now that his mother is dead, he has PTSD and is unable to play the piano. But don't worry because he
                  ...
meets a tsundere named Kaori who will help him overcome his trauma by abusing him more! She forces him to play the piano because the best way to overcome emotional trauma is by moving the traumatized person to have mental breakdowns in the middle of professional piano performances in front of a large audience. Kousei's onstage meltdowns were so cringy beyond what any intentional cringe comedy could ever achieve, but beyond this is a deplorable story about healing abuse with more abuse.

Never does Your Lie in April convince you that it is accurate. It's plastic misery porn. It's stereotypical archetypal characters who think they are all so clever with their pretentious, overwritten monologues. The visuals are incredibly over-polished to make this story about child abuse, depression, grief, and terminal illness seem as idealized as possible: Vibrant golden lighting, constant pink flower petals drifting through the air, a colorful palette, glossy character art, but a far cry from reality. Sugarcoating serious topics is the cheapest way to draw the attention of a large teenage audience. Boisterous piano music carries all the weight in 'sad' scenes rather than actual writing quality. Sure this show is technically pretty, but the budget was relatively high, but good art should complement quality writing, not distract you from its terribleness. 

Just look at the misguided attempts at comedy. In almost every serious scene outside of performances, there will be an interruption by a bad slapstick joke thrown in before the drama can hit with any actual impact. Swapping into a chibi art style and directly changing the sad music to upbeat comedy skits destroys the flow of the entire scene. If you tell the director that levity is good, but anime should use comedy sparingly in a MELODRAMA, he would smack you across the face. It's not helped that the jokes are couched in simple misunderstandings and are so damn repetitive. In every episode, we get the same tsundere routine. Kaori yells at Kousei for some contrived reason, then he stares off in the distance vacantly, and nothing progresses. 

What's worse is the comedy existed in conflict with the show's themes. Kousei's friends were helping him overcome his trauma of BEING ABUSED, and Kaori tsundere smacked him every episode, along with his childhood friend Tsubasi hitting him because he wasn't doing what they wanted him to. I never felt endeared by him because he's just an open proxy for the audience, his emotional baggage feels underwritten, and he is constantly spouting obnoxious metaphors to sound more intelligent than the 14-year-old idiot he is. Still, the abuse is deplorable and only makes his friends seem worse. Also, just because the show doesn't outwardly acknowledge a character's extreme flaws doesn't give the character some hidden depth. It means the writer was careless, and the characters are unlikable assholes.

Kousei's personality is too bland to be a compelling protagonist, sure, he has vague emotional baggage, but this isn't enough to excuse how boring he is to watch. His backstory shows that he was a piano prodigy as a child but quit after having a mental breakdown on stage, which was brought on by the abuse from his dying mother. It's an interesting hook, but his mother is a one-dimensional caricature of a child abuser. Then in the present day, he meets Kaori, a free-spirited girl who doesn't stick to the sheet music, the opposite of what his rigid mother instructed him to do. It's an incredibly generic premise for a generic series, but the execution is where it slides from mediocrity into awfulness. 

He is pushed to play piano to get over his PTSD by Kaori and his other friends. If he can't handle being on stage, he shouldn't constantly be going back to professional events; there are ways for him to work out his issues without accepting the abuse and channeling his trauma into the piano.

Everyone who dislikes Kousei is framed as wrong; they're the closest thing the show has to antagonists. He is disrespectful to all those other kids who practiced hard and cared about the competition.

Kaori is even shittier. The two leads seldom share a meaningful conversation. Many of their encounters in the show's first half are just the same situation; tsundere yelling at the deadpan brain-dead main character, repeated repeatedly. All the repetition makes it hard to buy into their love other than a yearning for one another. Kaori remains Kousei's black cat, an ethereal being to be looked upon but never understood. Your Lie in April seemed wholly content to leave them a singular piece, even when they were right beside one another, looking away in tears and monologuing about their love. There is no understanding. 

Even when Kaori finally breaks her facade and tells Kousei how she feels, he can only stare off silently and monologue about how her beauty juxtaposes her bleak surroundings with the vocabulary used to describe a painting—never seeing her as a person. Kaori is his dying cute thing, a cat, a girl, whatever. It doesn't matter. The story is often told from Kousei's perspective, but we at least hear some monologues from her to understand her personality and stakes in the situation, but nothing more. Kaori just has an unnamed illness. Why bother doing research when you can just call it ambiguous? Being true to yourself is crucial, but the world is more than just you. You can't just do whatever you want and expect all your dreams to come true. You have to, you know, do work—this is the REAL WORLD, after all. You can't make a fool of yourself at professional events repeatedly. You can't mess up people's lives with manipulative lies.

Imagine if the girl you liked, the one who had been hitting on you and telling your friends she was in love with you, turned out to be lying the whole time to get close to your friend? Oh, sorry, I'm DEAD and can't actually make up with Cardboard Cutout-kun, and now he'll probably have that permanent mental baggage over the girl who died without admitting she was manipulating him. Never able to face her. But Kaori says that Watari isn't sincere enough. She deems him less without even bothering to get to know him beyond their superficial encounters. But of course, our Potato-kun protagonist is way better because he totally has the extensive feels and is definitely not a shallow idiot who fails to try and understand her on a personal level. We could have avoided this awful issue entirely if the author had just had the two leads work out their problems together without any of the tsundere and misunderstanding bullshit. Oh well, I guess we just really needed netorare to justify that sweet universal acclaim.

Trying to go off script, to break the mold, is what Kaoru wants Kousei to do. That is the core theme of the series. However, the show itself is very by the numbers and painstakingly predictable. The side cast is barely worth mentioning: Underdeveloped, one-dimensional plot devices. Watari is forgotten, Izanagi was so annoying, and Sethi Taco needed more backstory. 

The tonal shifts are distracting, but I've yet to feel immersed in the drama or comedy long enough to be frustrated by the moments they overlap. The tone is so broken. Everyone knows this; even the writers probably knew they sucked at balancing style. Don't make your 14-year-old kid's monologue hamfisted philosophy in one scene and then quickly swap into cringy gag comedy in the next. The whole thing feels very insincere and sensationalized to evoke emotional stimuli. Melodrama is not a fundamental flaw; there are good and bad melodramas. It's possible to balance over-the-top drama with human characters or even characters that symbolize something, anything. 

The show is dead serious and constantly reminds us of this through the poetic pseudo-philosophical inner monologues that, once you stop and think about it for a moment, are bafflingly stupid at best and troubling at worst. I would love to look at these monologues from the perspective of a bunch of kids who are too wrapped up in their emotions and want to sound smart, you know, like Steins;Gate. But Your Lie in April does not have self-awareness like Steins;Gate does. Instead, the show presents these pretentious as hell monologues as something to be taken seriously. I don't like to refer to things as 'pretentious' because of how often that is used to describe complex stories, but Your Lie in April is pretentious. 

The art style is clean, colorful, and lovely. The animation, though, it's terrible. There are so many looped animations, and the bike scene was hideous. Clair De Lune in any sad scene. Wawawa. The anime teaches you very little about music, history, playing it, or the character's processes. The show needs to detail what makes the performers talented. It just chooses to TELL us rather than show.

The ending is objectively nonsense, a cheap deus ex machina to make you cry. If you view it as happening in reality, it makes no sense with the show's continuity and is a moronic asspull. If you assume it is Kousei's imagination, then it is even more troubling. This interpretation would lead you to believe that he channeled the final moment into his performance. If he was performing for her, like a final goodbye, it might have felt like he cared. Instead, we got him envisioning her talent to mimic it in his performance.


I might just be getting too old for petty teenage romances, but when the characters treat being in love with one another like it's the end of the world, it's hard not to roll your eyes. YLIA is sitting at a misleadingly high rating because, at the time it aired, viewers were starved of a high-budget melancholic anime that would give them the big feels, so what tasted like a delicious cake was, in reality, just a stale crust of bread. You know what, though? That's ok. If you want a feelsy fluff to cry and don't mind if you forget it soon after, watch it. But if you watch a remotely well-written drama, Your Lie in April will leave you sorely disappointed."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Here’s some interesting fruit for thought: imagine a world without music or sound. A place void of lyrics, voices, or emotions. It would look pretty hollow doesn’t it? For a character named Kousei Arima, he knows what it’s like to be around music. During his childhood, he became a child prodigy with his talent in playing the piano. But one single solidary moment changed his life forever and his world became hollow.  From the child prodigy he once was, Kousei is now a normal kid attending school with his friends. Until one day, he meets a beautiful young girl named Kaori Miyazono who could
                  ...
make his inner dark world just a bit brighter. This is the story of about more than just music. This is a story about conquering his demons in a world where anything is possible.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (April is Your Lie) is an anime adaptation based off the manga of the same name. However, there are two noticeable things to take consider about the source material. One is that the series is actually completed so expect a full adaptation. And two, it has won a Kodansha Manga Award for the shounen category in 2013. Thus, expectations coming into the series are relatively high. It also doesn’t take long for the series to take off in the beginning as we meet Kousei and his friends. The first few episode sets up the foundation of what’s to come. We meet Kousei who seems to be doing well at school with a normal personality. He has friends so loner isn’t part of his vocabulary but there are also hints showing that part of his past isn’t so very pleasant. The shift in balance of the series is reflected by the musical atmosphere. The way he meets Kaori could be described as a miracle as she is someone who really stands out in this show. But for what’s worth, the series isn’t just about music alone.

In many ways, the show is almost like a journey, at least for our main characters anyways. In the case of Kousei, it’s much more. To him, it’s about overcoming a deep scar that still remains in present day influenced by his past. This is clearly shown when he and Kaori goes up on the stage to perform but during the session, Kousei suffers a mental breakdown. We can see his grey and hollow world after realizing that he cannot “hear the music notes” from the piano. Of course, this can all be interpreted as a mental sphere as all these events are going through his mind. The talking cat, the water-like dream phases, and broken piano notes serves more as a metaphor. In this way, the show does an outstanding job in reflecting Kousei’s mental stability. It doesn’t take long for viewers to find out that the cause is Kousei’s overbearing mother. You ever been part of a family where your parents push you beyond your limits? I’m talking about the type where they expect you to come out as #1 every single time. Kousei’s mother is something along that line but what’s more so is her final moments that really stung Kousei in the heart. So for this show, it’s about how Kousei can recover from that in this journey infused with both music and interpersonal issues. On another level, there’s also Kaori and her problems. Although her past isn’t influenced by an overbearing parent, there’s something that is holding her back. It doesn’t take long for the show to make viewers suspect that she may not be a perfectly healthy girl like some of us think she may be. Just do take a note that the show can sometimes be staggering when it comes to transition between events from the past and present. The timing is a key and it nails it on spot when it finds its way. However, the show sometimes over-saturates it to a point where it may become an annoyance or overbearing.

Of course, these two main characters are only half of the main cast. On a lighter side of the story, we have Kousei’s childhood friend Tsubaki. She has an interesting past with him that brings out both a brighter and emotional side of the story. Her cherry personality is similar to that of Kaori and is always supportive of her friends. Then, there’s popular school athlete Watari who is more of the ladies’ man. Unfortunately, the series doesn’t focus much on his character as much as the others. We don’t see much about his background story and he lacks the impact of both emotional and social problems that is reflected in the other characters. What do these all four characters have in common though? There’s a sense of connection. All of them are supportive with one another in their dreams. In fact, without them, Kousei’s life would have been quite different than what he imagined it to be. Then, there’s the more emotional side of the story involving romance. I can say this show is labeled more as a romance square. There are obvious hints to who likes although some of the characters themselves don’t realize it until later in the story. However, do take not that the show isn’t just focused on romance and serves more as a sub-plot; albeit an important one to bring out the interpersonal issues with the characters especially towards at the very end. Another key thing to note about character relationships is how they react to certain situations. In many ways, it’s realistic and relatable to how some of our own lives. I also have to say that the growing bond between the characters remains strong from almost start to finish with every episode. 

In a world where there is music, competition also exists. For Kousei, that also comes in sheer force with characters like Emi and Takeshi. In most shows, they would push this plot to a point where competition becomes a driven force. But in this series, Kousei’s concern isn’t so much about winning but about overcoming his own fears. After all, he already proved himself to be the stronger competitor in the past against the both of them. No, it’s more about how Kousei can live up to people’s expectations in the present. A good portion of the first half presents Kousei’s fight against his inner demons. The illusionary binds of his past is his major obstacle that only he can overcome. And this is where the show gets the more dramatic when we see Kousei’s multidimensional struggles. However, he also realizes for the first time that his friends are in his heart to fight with him (especially Kaori). And at the same time, it echoes Kousei’s present life and how he can find ways to change. This becomes a driven factor as Kousei also plays the role of a mentor after meeting an old friend later on in the story. This is somewhat similar to Kaori’s own battle as she literally fights for her life. With a tragic sense of tone, the show is able to capitalize on each pivotal moment and articulate them in a profound manner. It’s also fun at the same time to see how the show is able to mix in comedy with timings during appropriate moments to make you feel more at ease. 

If there’s something else unique about the show, artwork can easily fit in that category. Taking a close glance at the visuals is like looking at lively water paint. The show has this serene-like mood wherever it goes. Each episode makes a solid effort to illustrate the backgrounds, characters, and setting with its pastel artistry. Character designs also reflect on their personalities well especially for Kaori and Kousei. It even shows the physical condition of Kaori later on as there’s a dramatic change in her looks. Similarly, the show also adapts metaphors with a precise mood to reflect on whatever message it’s trying to deliver. There are however occasions when the series becomes lazy in regards with the background characters. Well, it’s more like the characters that just appears in the background with their single dotted eyes. But overall when it comes to art, the show knows what it’s doing with it phenomenal production.

Ah yes, the music. This is probably a flagship for this series. It is a driving factor of Kousei’s journey to once again realize why he began playing piano from the beginning. As this series highlights both piano and violin play (rather than singing), it adapts more of a classic tone. Famous music such as Kreutzer Sonata (Beehoven) makes a presence in this show. At the same time, it’s interesting to see how the show reacts to the characters’ movements on stage. Their feelings are poured in a stylistic matter to synchronize with the movements while their music speaks by itself through talent. Other noticeable music played such as Etude in E minor and Lover’s Duet also makes their debut in the show to spice up the hype. Even the duet plays by Kousei and Kaori is important for their ability to move the audience beyond just the music notes. OP and ED songs on most parts has their lighthearted style such as the case of Goose House and Coala Mode. It also has some foreshadowing and imagery with a stylish portrayal that can just be so fun to watch. Finally, I give a lot of praise to the voice acting of this show. Characters are able to speak from their heart with their very real voice, perhaps an irony of the title. But for everything that comes and goes, music is something that I’d stress not to forget.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has this powerful ability to convey and enlighten beyond just the musical side of its story. We get character relationships, interpersonal struggles, and all in all a journey that is filled with passion. Romance may not always prevail as a dynamic factor and the music may not be a suitable taste for everyone. However, the show captures the essence of personalities and issues. It effectively portrays a compelling cinema when it comes to performance (both in musical style and character). And furthermore, the show has a graceful portrayal at what having friends is like during the darkest of the hour. A show like this makes a lot of its concepts and themes relevant. It has a meaning that celebrates music culture and a journey of ground-shaking emotions."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a coming of age story about the 14 year old pianist Arima Kousei.
After the death of his mother he loses the ability to hear the piano.
Until one day he meets a very forced tsundere girl - Miyazono Kaori.
The writers wanted for Kaori to help Kousei return to the music world and show that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the structured and rigid style Kousei was used to.
But instead she literally forces him to do things her way turning him into her doge (couldn't resist) and becoming a Taiga (from ToraDora!) clone, giving a wrong message, that
                  ...
bullying traumatized people is fine as long as it's for their own good. 

I understand that this show is suppose to be drama, but this is melodrama to the next level. 
I couldn't help cringing at parts I should be feeling sentimental about instead. 
Speaking of laughing, this serious show also attempts to throw in a bit of comedy.
Not sure how beating up an already traumatized person, but whatever makes your clock tick is fine by me.

Despite the large amount of unnecessary episodes, the majority of the supporting characters remain bland,forgetful and undeveloped. I would go as far as saying that most of them were completely unnecessary.
The only good developed character is the main protagonist who starts as a dull, gutless Shinji (from Neon Genesis Evangelion) clone who has no reason to play music anymore to something slightly better.
And another thing the character of Kaori got very late development. For the 90 % of the show she was just a forceful tsundere doing forceful things.

The main reason i even watched this sad excuse for an anime was because of the classic music it promised and it delivered.
There are some timeless pieces from Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and other prominent names of the music world.
Tho the Opening and the ending however were absolutely horrendous,but i have to say they were fitting for a show of the same caliber.
The voice acting was good,but not because of an amazing Seiyu cast,but instead of how easy it is to voice characters so shallow.

The animation of is beautiful full of vibrant backgrounds.
Another thing that made an impression on me was the scenes in which an instrument is being played the animation was at its peak.
The art itself is just plain moe which can piss some viewers,but that doesn't mean it's bad.And Unlike other moeblob the characters in this one have full lips.
What more can you want ?A good story ?Who needs those !?Just gimme dat tsundere loli!

Although having great Sound and decent animation,this anime had MAJOR phasing problem jumping from the tragedies of the main hero to the romance of a minor characters,pointless character interactions and some''genius'' mind though using monologues to the point of beating a dead horse.
At one point i just wanted Kousei to get in the damn robot!

For some actually good anime that revolves around music i point you towards Sakamichi no Apollon, White Album 2, Nana and Nodame Cantabile. Heck if being a weeb is not quite your tempo you might even watch Whiplash.(ba-dum-tss!)"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"{This content might contain possible spoilers}

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso or Your Lie in April narrative is simple, easy to follow, and predictable at times. It has a combination of school life, emotional drama, and some kiddy romance and on the cherry on top, music that focuses on the sound made by the elites. It gives off an aroma, a recipe for a good anime. After I finish consuming the show contents, I thought for a moment. Why is this show lacking some distinctive flavor or a unique taste? Then I realize this show is not what it seems to be. Starting off with the
                  ...
show over repetitiveness when it comes melodrama, handling its comedy and characters internal conflict. It’s always nice to see some melodrama from time to time, especially when it comes to characters having an identity crisis due to puberty. But this anime doesn’t know what a satisfactory amount of drama is needed to make its character appealing. Instead, it rains a hefty large amount of drama in every episode. People cry in this series a lot, not dropping small droplets of tears. They burst out crying like somebody is cutting too many onions around the show. Some are justifiable while some are straight out unexpected and bizarre for the moment. There is no congruent built-up with the emotional drama, it gets lesser and lesser of an impact every time use. It treats drama such a natural occurrence. And adding salt to the wound, Shigatsu has a terrible take when it comes to tonal shift. The comedy of the show, to be honest, are short one-liner jokes with no good built up nor a creative message around it. Most of the time the comedy is about innocent green jokes, it felt cheap and dry. Thought by it owns alone I don’t think it's terrible, but once it used in diverting serious plot points to relieve tension, that is when it crosses the line. I understand that light humor is there to ease up the tension of the story atmosphere and sometimes it can be done quite nicely but the way it was handled in this show, it damages the already weakening emotional impact of the narrative. How can I take a particular scene seriously, for example, the last scene of an episode shows a girl collapsing in front of a vast audience, then follow up by the beginning of the next episode, a randomly inserted humor about showing her half-naked body and getting embarrassed afterward. And I am not kidding this scene actually happens. Not only did they throw away the built-up of an emotional drama from the previous episode but they also disrespected its character dignity. It becomes much difficult to identify your cast as relatable human beings for their emotions change drastically from time to time. It didn’t felt natural for me and it’s a lot harder to understand the situation. The show has a bad habit of manipulating the emotions of its characters and atmosphere too fast.


Next moving to character internal conflict, it also has a recurring theme. The entire plot revolves around Arima, Kosei, all character motivation, internal struggles, and personality is circling around him. The show even bothers to give you the illusion that not everything is about Kosei by showing each character internal monologue after they were introduced to further extend the story. Thought characters giving viewpoints is also nice, but most of the time it’s all about what they view about Kosei in their own perspective, on how they were inspired and motivated in hearing Kosei's perfect musical score and they enforce how great of a character he is. And this doesn’t help define them as a character at all. They are more like tools that only serve certain points in the story. Once they are done, they eventually get shoved in the corner. The minor characters function more like musical notes for Kosei to follow in playing his story.

When it comes to Kosei’s emotional scars. First, if you put real-world psychological studies. He might have developed “Amusia”. It is a musical disorder that appears mainly as a defect in processing pitch but also encompasses musical memory and recognition. To be precise, acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of brain damage. Due to Kosei's beloved mother's death with some circumstance surrounding the events, it is most likely Kosie’s suffered a significant amount of depression and anxiety at such a young age that causes brain damage. But it can also be a coping mechanism he develops when he plays the piano. His negative feelings from his past resurface, and his mind blocks him from hearing sounds that work as a ""Psychological Conditioning"" association in his mind, to protect himself from a huge psychological breakdown his mind suffered in the past. Too bad nobody ever bothers calling psychologists about this problem and people assume everything is alright once he quit music. In context, there isn’t any problem with Kosei having mental and emotional scars. It has a good presentation on how it feels like to be tone-deaf. But the way the narrative explain it to the audience, repeating the explanation over and over again, it's choking me. Even though I have no reason to pity Kosei or have sympathy towards him. And instead, I like him for being an elite pianist with an interesting background story, the show doesn’t let me think it that way. It forces me to believe that I should feel sorry for him and care for him because he was abuse in many ways possible thus killing his capability to be somewhat of a decent character.


And this where discover another problem with the story towards its main characters. The show is baiting you to sympathize with your main characters; feel sorry for them in a way that how you perceive them. Even though characters themselves, never wanted to be seen that way. Scenes where I see more about Kaori’s being a tragic state for emotional appeal. Tsubaki somewhat complicated emotional feelings towards Kosei, on frequent dosage.  Putting does aside, we actually don’t have the privilege of knowing them more in a positive light because Shigatsu is fast pace when it comes to its story. Characters in Shigatsu come and go. Even classical music isn’t safe from it, you actually have some instances they skip seemingly intense musical scores because of lack of airtime to do so. 


{Miscellaneous Thought}

After some salty perspective when it comes to story and characters. Let me discuss the positive this show has to offer. From a technical standpoint, Shigatsu has great production value. It has a very good visual design that is sometimes emotionally outstanding at times, some background design that can carve an identity of its own and cutesy and eye-catchy character design that doesn’t resemble a blob. When comes to the OP, OST, & ED this is where the show pretty much glitters with brightness. They are objectively and personal in my viewpoint very well composed. Shigatsu also has a good moral message about music is freedom of the soul. Music is a reflection of once emotion and personality, I respect that. The final episode is the only episode I totally enjoyed watching over the course of the series, for it enforces the idea of music is the direct presentation of the soul. The very first instances that the show bothers to focus heavily on the music and visual presentation in communicating character resolve and emotion. It was the best moment of the anime, which I yearn the show should be doing in the initial episodes in the first place. My recurring complaint is the constant insertion of too many internal monologues and side comment dialogues, it destroys the immersion with the music. The character voices are louder than the music itself, thus it’s no different from background music playing while the character is talking at the heat of the moment. I know this kind of narrative works when it comes to manga, books, or other media that doesn’t have a sound but in anime with audio, it’s doesn’t feel right. I appreciate some efforts of the story in trying to make some justice when it comes to its characters. To be fair characters are not one-dimensional cardboards that we only know one side of the coin. A good example of this Kosei’s mother presented as an abusive mother at first but later on revealed she has an excusable reason to do so even though I disagree with her action. And another is Kaori’s character, in the initial episode of the series Kaori is perceive as this pure, strong, perfect, selfish, and manipulative character that annoys me from time to time, but there is a somewhat reasonable explanation about her action. But it felt too late in fleshing her out as a character in the final episode. The show also explores lots of interesting ideas and information about the music industry like social criticism, inferiority complex, stage fright, the intense pressure of public expectation, and more but remain scattered as an afterthought.


{Final Thoughts}

This anime has every element at its disposal to make a simple premise great and memorable but it completely lacking in some categories and what’s worst it handles some its potential pieces into disarray. For me, this anime could be amazing. It has good music, well-crafted animation, and an interesting premise but instead of taking advantage of this element in anime format. It chooses the easiest path for its musical direction. Sure the story is easy to understand, you don’t even need to think much to comprehend the situation but does it delivers adequate satisfaction? There is no doubt the message is good but it felt sort of lazy in practice. Most of the effort is focused on the technical side.  I wish they should add a little more effort when it comes to scriptwriting and storytelling. A good character and story can also contribute to the impact of the animation and music in my personal opinion. If the show has proper balance in the emotional tonal shift, a slower pacing, more character exposition, some additional episodes, and more focus on the music than the internal monologues. It is more than enough for me to love the anime and considered it amazing. So far I don’t hate the anime but rather feel it's lacking a bit for me to actually considered liking it as a whole. But then again I really liked the music and sadly that’s the only thing I can remember this anime for. 

Do the music and show reach my heart?

Yes, the music actually reaches my heart even for a stand-alone. But the character and story don't stick with me."

Life is a concert, a conglomerate of symphonies and pieces that seamlessly transition from one song to the next.  Like a concert hall, life has moments of crescendos, the rising areas where we feel accomplished, or pleased with ourselves, but it also has those moments of diminuendo, where our lives dip into sadness, failure, and despair.  There are times where we speed up,
                  ...
even flutter by with the trills and flings of life, and there are times where we slow down to take in the small things that we sometimes miss.  In the end though, life, much like music, ends just before the time that we finally begin to enjoy it.  It is with this, that I bring you a review of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, better known as ""Your lie in April.""

Author's Note:  (This is also my 100th review on MAL.  YAY!  :D  )

Story (8.89/10): Arima Kousei was once a brilliant prodigy on the piano.  Known throughout the entire music community in his hometown, he has now fallen into despair with the passing of his mother, also known as his music teacher.  With the despair of losing one of the most important people in his life, Kousei has fallen into despair, now according to him, unable to hear the notes of the piano, now unable to hear or use his last tie to his now deceased mother.  It is here in his despair and sorrow that on one faithful day in spring, underneath the cherry blossom trees, he hears the sound of music playing, and he meets the girl known as Kaori Miyazono, the girl who would change his life forever.

Shigatsu, as I like to call it, follows the story of Kousei as he, his friends Watari and Tsubaki , and most importantly, Kaori, bring Kousei back to the world of music, putting him in front of his trials, and the past the he is so desperately conflicted about.  What I think this story excels so much in, is how we as the audience look through what Kousei is experiencing and go along with him as this new life of his takes him on a journey that he has never experienced before.  We experience what being a pianist is like, and what kind of trials and tribulations someone of this career path experiences.  (You know, without all the methodical practice.  It kinda skips over that thankfully.)  At the beginning, the show uses this kind of story as its plot.  But as it advances, it changes into something more.  

Shigatsu utilizes the theme of life as its main focal point in the series.  Throughout the series, the show not only focuses on Kousei's story, but also the people that are around him.  In life, we have many people around us that help us in different ways.  Similar to this, Shigatsu uses this idea by running much shorter stories to our main protagonist, making the anime feel a little bit more real and developed.  Within these, other character's ideals make the focal point of the series for just a brief moment and give the series more life.  

In addition, Shigatsu has its own unique way of storytelling, a very brilliant way of doing so, I might add.  In terms of actual dialogue, the show doesn't really utilize that as much as a normal anime would.  Instead, half of the subtitles that you will be reading will be utilized in internal character monologues.  Very often, the show will transition from a character interaction to a moment in time that focuses solely on one character thinking to his/herself.  With this, the audience gets a very clear picture as to what the certain character is thinking at the moment, and the emotions that they are conveying become very prominent and clear to the viewer.  Personally, I think that this is a great way to showcase the expansive amount of character growth in this series solely because of the fact that the internal monologues provide the viewer and easier way of understanding what each individual character is coming to terms with.  It perfectly encapsulates what this show is about and it is by far, one of the highest points this show has in terms of storytelling.  Sadly though, no show is without its flaws.  (Now that would be a lie, if it didn't.)

Pacing is what I feel is one of the biggest flaws in this anime.  With the show being 22 episodes long, the show is split up into two equal parts of 11 episodes, each half dealing with something different with progression of time.  The biggest flaw I have seen with this show is the fact that both halves are incredibly different in terms of pacing.  Bluntly put, the first half is way too drawn out and rather slow, while the second half is slightly rushed, with a good chunk of details missing.  In addition, the show while provides little sidestories for a good deal of the cast, doesn't really do it for all.  Two very prominent characters, Watari and Emi, don't get any portion of the story really devoted to themselves, as evident of the lack of personal narratives/internal monologues that a lot of characters have.  While these flaws don't seem very big, in a show where story progression and character growth, explanation, and development are essential to the themes it was trying to convey, they become very glaring and put a bad chord to this show.

Overall though, Shigatsu's story was executed very well.  While missing some details, the anime encapsulated the manga to a near perfect status, and finished the story of this beautiful little tale with a very heartfelt and emotional ending.  The show deals with the hardships of loss, the grand thoughts of our own personal dreams and aspirations, the happiness and despair that life brings us, and overall, the idea of no matter how hard we are beaten down, we must keep moving forward.  No matter what happens, we must keep on living.

Overview:
+  Simple, yet beautiful story
+  Exudes character growth and development
+  Internal monologues help with story-telling
-   Pacing varies from episode to episode, creating imbalance
-   Lacking growth/importance for some relatively key characters

Characters (8.76/10): In Shigatsu, the characters represent the instruments to a symphony.  As they spin the tale of music, each individual character provides their own part to the song ""plot"", creating their own sound that melds well with the piece known as ""Your lie in April.""

Arima Kousei is our main protagonist in this series.  As a prodigy on the piano, he has since two years prior to the story's beginning not performed in a piano competition, squandering around his miserable life day in and day out of his home as he deals with his mother's loss, forcing himself to play the thing that he hates the most even though he, according to him, ""Can't hear the notes.""  Kousei out of all of the characters in this series gets the most character development, with every character warping around him as some kind of inspiration in order to help sing the tune that is his life.  As the series progresses, you can see the progress he makes as a character as he relearns the piano, develop his own personal sound, and get closer to the people around him, especially one special girl.  

And then, we have Kaori Miyazono.  According to Kousei, Kaori is a selfish girl, a violent brute who forces him to go along with whatever antic she has come up with, making him go along with whatever she wants to do at the time, and punishing him every time he does something that displeases her.  Kaori serves as Kousei's main inspiration and focus for why he plays the piano.  Throughout the whole series, you can see how Kaori and Kousei grow a bond together, blossoming the aspect of life known as bonds and closeness between people.  In the beginning, you don't really learn much about Kaori, but instead, about the influence that she has as you watch Kousei admire this girl's freedom and tenacity for life.  As the series goes on though, you learn more about her, understanding more about who Kaori Miyazono is.  What I think is a flaw for Kaori is the fact that she really remains a mystery for the show up until the very last episode.  With a character that is so essential to the plot, the show doesn't really put much attention towards her past like a lot of other characters.  While saving all the facts till the end does work for the show to some degree, I still wished that the series gave a bit more information on Kaori as a person during the span of the show rather than saving everything till the end.  

Apart from these two, we have the other two ""main"" characters, Tsubaki and Watari.  These two are an interesting duo of characters primarily because of the fact that rather than serving as main characters, they don't really show up all too often.  The amount of screentime they both get doesn't really make them seem like a main character at all.  Even less so for Watari's case because he really doesn't serve much of a purpose for the series besides one key point.  This is evident  because Watari doesn't actually get a single monologue to himself, instead, really just being that dude who likes soccer and girls.  As for Tsubaki, the series does flesh her out a little more as a character.  While small in comparison to Kousei, it was a nice addition to the story that in the long run, did play out some significance to the overall story.  

As for supporting cast, the series does well in developing a good number of its side characters.  From Takashi and his little sister's aspirations for piano, to Hiroko's atonement for her past deeds.  Apart from them though, the other characters serve rather minimal roles, but are really of no downside to the series.  However, like I have mentioned before, the character known as Emi doesn't particularly get much development.  I find this odd because she's on the same level of importance as the characters mentioned above, yet she doesn't really get any time devoted to herself.  It's this imbalance that leaves the sound of the show slightly off-key because pretty much every other character that has some sort of importance towards Kousei is given a section of the show devoted to them.  

Overview:
+  Fantastic character growth
+  Growth for side characters relevant to the story
-   Kaori's development came too late/involvement wasn't there
-   Several key characters didn't receive same treatment as others

Art and sound (9.09/10):  A-1 pictures have done it again.  Shigatsu wa kimi no uso is an anime that has very stunning visuals.  From the first minute of the series, the show is breathtaking to look at, utilizing a very light and detailed environment and artstyle as its way of conveying the story.  Showcasing a lot of symbolism during the piano performance scenes is also what this show excels at doing, utilizing visual imagery to convey the emotions that the pianists playing at the time are conveying, making the pre-recorded concert music sound very stunning.  

The show uses a dual artstyle in order to convey what it wants to show.  In addition to the already stunning visuals that the show normally provides, Shigatsu also has a comedic style of animation to it, essentially reverting the characters to become little demonic sprites of themselves rather than their ordinary, beautifully looking representations.  While this is quite niche, the show does suffer a little bit from this.  The reason being is that sometimes, the comedic artstyle doesn't really fit really well with scene that it's placed in, (sometimes putting it in a scene with its standard animation), which can really leave an ugly sound.  Sometimes, the comedic style can look downright bad because it's so unfitting of the moment it's being used in.  

As for music, there is no denying that an anime about music would express such a beautiful set of tracks.  Because the series is split into two parts, each part features their own OP and ED.  For openings, we have ""Hikaru Nara"" and ""Nanairo Symphony"".  Both of these tracks are beautiful to listen to.  Hikaru Nara has a very big band feel to it, with a group of 6 people known as Goose House singing a six part harmony to the song, while Nanairo Symphony uses a single singer in a small band.  Both of these openings are beautiful and stunning in their own way, giving off their own individual feels that can drive one to not only sing to the lyrics (given they've heard it long enough), but dance and move along to the beat.  

As for endings, we have ""Kirameki"" for the first half, and ""Orange"" for the second half.  Compared to their opening counterparts, these two have very different emotions for each of them.  While they both utilize one singer, Kirameki gives off the hopeful and bright feel that corresponds to the pleasant feelings that life can give us, while Orange sings a sorrow filled and regretful tone responding to the sadness that life can deal us.  All four of these tracks I feel are very memorable pieces that deserve credit where credit is due because when anime music is exceptionally memorable, I feel it should be considered a masterpiece.

In addition, Shigatsu's OST is fantastic to listen to.  While the entire OST is more or less filled with tracks that sound rather similar, with only slight variations of instruments being used to play the tracks, practically every track is beautiful in their own way, and each are memorable in their own way.  Each piece is used at the right moments in the anime and help exemplify the power that each scene has, thus, making the ""feels train"" hit just a little bit harder.

Overview:
+  Stunning animation
+  Fantastic soundtrack
+/-  Comedic art style is hit/miss
+/-  Good chunk of the OST sounds rather similar

Personal Enjoyment (9.78/10):  When I first saw this show on Anichart, my first thought was ""Cool!  A music anime that's actually about music!""  (Sorry, the memories of K-on being a ""music anime"" flooded in)  When I first started this series, I knew that this was going to be good the moment I started.  I expected myself to be completely blown away by what I was about to witness.  In the end though, I was sorta right.  

Did I like this anime?

Absolutely.  As a music player myself, it was easy to engross myself in the beautiful soundtrack and the concert pieces that this anime featured during its runtime.  Not only were the aesthetics amazing, but I found myself engrossed with the story, feeling depressed and sad after every episode.  The characters for the most part drew me in, and I was glad that this series didn't disappoint me.  

What didn't I like about this anime?

As I have stated before, with a show that tries its best to stay true to what it wants to do, any messups become clear as day.  For Shigatsu, the flaws existed partially in every genre I have analyzed.  The pacing of the series is unbalanced and many times, jump over things and sometimes don't let certain events/moments sink in fully, skipping to the next part without a moment's notice.  In addition, the comedic visual style clashes heavily with the standard animation, leaving the viewer to view the scene as weird, and the character growth/explanation for certain characters (especially Kaori) were not brought to its fullest extent, and docked the series down a bit.

Would I recommend this anime?

Yes.  Personally, I feel like Shigatsu is a great example and representation of life in animated form.  It begins slow like the beginning of a piece, rising up and up with every note being played, before ending on a soft major chord before you even realize that the series is over.  It represents the beauty and terrifying nature that our own futures have, and that no matter what, we have to look forward.  Drama isn't everyone's favorite genre, and it's understandable if music isn't either.  But, from what I've seen, Shigatsu is a beautiful show, stunning in almost every aspect, and is a prime example of what a good anime can be.  Saying that it's perfect, well it's a bit much.  Saying it's a touching and well-written story, well, it'd be a lie if I said it wasn't.

Overall Score: 8.95/10"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"While the production values were very high and the sound, animation and art all looked and played wonderfully I couldn't get past the storyline that was confusing even to itself. There was so much needles drama and the ever present love trapezoid that really didn't need to exist for as long as it did. 
It was too steeped in it's own melodrama for it's own good, I feel it could have been greater."

The story is about Arima Kousei a ex-pianist that one day gets invited by he friends to go hang out with they to show Watari(a friend of Arima) a girl named Kaori Miyazono, Arima go to the local first and see Kaori playing a instrument, immediately Kousei fall in love for the girl that like his friend.

A few episodes later Kaori tells Kousei to be her companion for a show,
                  ...
Kousei refuses it but later on he accept it.

When he start playing everything is good but he remembers of his dead mother saying, to him ""That's your punition"", and he starts playing very bad since he cannot hear the notes, he look at Kaori and with determination and he start, playing the piano again but he imagine the sounds.


So basically the first part is focused on Kousei forgetting those bad memories and choose better memories so he can play the piano nice.
The other part is focused on Kaori disease.

The art is outstanding, it's hard to see animes with good art these days, this one of the reasons I didn't stop watching it.

About the characters, I can say in the beggining Kousei is a very very boring character, Tsubaki is dumb until the end of the anime, Watari is funny, Kaori is the typical character that is dumb but still fun and can bring you tears to your eyes.

The anime has a lot I mean a lot of Melodrama, every episode someone is in depression or cry a lot and someone shows up to cheer up. I Don't get mad with a bit of drama, but in every episode it starts getting boring and repetitious and predictable.

My final opinion is this:

While this anime has a good art, music and good characters, it fails in character development, it uses a lot of melodrama, the story is too much predictable. I Liked the anime, but this anime can have a lot of opposite opinions because of the melodrama."

In terms of art, I cannot say much. It is a good art, both character design and the concept art are great. 

I must admit the animation was awesome! Just look at how Arima played his piano, not many music (especially) piano anime can animate such a great move of fingers on the keys. I am always, well almost hyperventilated every time I watched them play. It was outstanding.

The character development was... okay?

Now, in terms of story. I know many people love this anime,
                  ...
but I am sorry this was not my cup of tea. The idea was all good, I'd no problem... but how they put the idea and make it into story, I was just... should I say dreadful? The plot was horrifyingly slow. It was devastating for me to watch this anime, and disappointed, and tired, and so so so angry. 

Moreover, the thing I most detest was the flashback that keeps appearing in the middle of the performance and repeating over and over again. I know flashback is important to build the feel and emotions, but this was too much. I was so annoyed that I feel like want to throw my TV away.

I think it will be better if they cut it into 12 episodes.. After the 10th episode, I skipped most of the part and only get into the performance. 

So, the art and soundtrack are both mesmerising, but the story wasn't that interesting to watch. Piano no Mori movie is much more heartwarming than this sad romance music thing. In terms of story, Sakamichi no Appollon still wins compare to Shigatsu. My mistake was to watched this anime when I knew that romance anime is a no for me...."

My first proper review.

People go through life following the path they've chosen and often they encounter stories along the way that they never forget. Those stories, the living and breathing characters in those stories, the vivid worlds birthed from within the story, all of them break into fragments and get meshed into your being, into your personality, into your mind and soul. Those stories we all encounter shape up who we are, and this is one of them.

This particular fantasy, holds beautiful fragments in the form of music, faces, dialogue, emotions, struggles, imagery and sensations all bursting with color. They
                  ...
materialize inside you as valuable lessons that will forever be engraved in your mind.

The lessons themselves, they teach you that sometimes you need someone to push you forward and believe in you if you wish to achieve anything great. They teach you the power and freedom that music, human passion and art in all its forms has to offer. They teach you how to say goodbye and how to embrace what fragments and memories the people you encountered throughout your life have given you, even though they've drifted away. They teach you that nothing that's great or beautiful comes without a tiny bit of sacrifice, sweat and strife. The lessons teach you how to cope, heal and keep on moving through another spring, with a smile on your face and fragments in your heart.

There's a lot you can assimilate from this series, especially if you marathon 22 episodes in two days like I have, so I want to wish you a fun little ride, because it will definitely be something you won't forget any time soon, if ever.

- Story: 7/10 Good -

The story might be perceived as somewhat cliché by the veterans out there, but what mattered the most to me was the pacing and flow of everything. How every center piece unraveled in the beginning, how the narrative accelerated in small crescendo steps, with peaks every couple episodes. It was all that I was looking for. The story might have some imperceivable flaws in it and be a template straight-forward romantic comedy, but after all, what matters is the imprint it leaves on you. The story does show you multiple perspectives of other characters occasionally, which I really enjoyed. 

The comedic aspect of the show is decent, not great, but it sometimes stands out as bad by being misplaced in between several serious scenes that were developing nicely and it saddens you when you see that cut happen, but you get used to it after the first two or three times.

The romance aspect is constantly being displayed throughout each episode, but it alternates in importance gradually. Sometimes love becomes the focus, but there are other emotions out there beside it, some maybe more complex to explain, and the story has an entire spectrum of feelings for you to experience.

The story delves into darker parts as well, and that's what makes it good in my book. Treating matters like trauma, chronic illness the way it has been here departs it from many other works of the same genre, and ascends it in a higher place.

- Art/Animation: 9/10 Great -

It's bursting with color, and everything rises from monotones. Technical achievements is what carries a work of art, and in this case it does more than enough justice to the underlying world it aimed to build. The synesthesia between the imagery and the sound is an absolutely superb dance of two well known art forms: animation and music.

The art and animation is in a supporting role, the main stage being taken by the music. Because of that, it's not as great as other examples out there, but it's great nonetheless. In this show, the animation in art was made for the music.

All of this becomes clear when it reaches the pinnacle at the end of the series.

- Sound/Music: 10/10 Outstanding -

You can't help but stand up, applaud and ask for an ""Encore!"" after you experience this recital. By far the most vivid imprints and fragments you get from it are the music presented in its raw form: classical music. If this show doesn't make you adore classical music, then probably nothing will.

The emotions are conveyed masterfully through the soundtrack. I haven't seen a show mirror the story and characters as well as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. As expected from an anime that revolves around music, it doesn't disappoint.

Voice acting is top notch, too. There was no point in dragging the quality of the characters down if the instruments were so well spoken, wasn't it?

An aural delight. 

- Characters: 8/10 Very Good - 

The characters themselves aren't anything out of the ordinary. They're just young boys and girls that have their own paths to trek, their own struggles and ambitions, and I love how they've played their respective roles. 

The bad parts like the over-dramatic bursts of the characters and general elongated monologue scenes are not that big of a deal, unless you're the type of person that either cringes too easily or doesn't like to get too emotional. I personally enjoyed that intensity, even though many times it wasn't that warranted.

The characters become dear to you, bit by bit as you get to know them. Some side characters don't shine that brightly, but the main ones do very much that.

- Enjoyment: 10/10 Outstanding - 

Overall, this has to be one of my favorite experiences I received from watching an animated series, ever. It's true what they say that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and the way this entire jigsaw puzzle shapes up and ends with a masterfully executed center-piece is just astonishing to witness.

- Overall: 9/10 Great -

                                      (6/22 eps)","There are two things that I love; music and anime. Put them together and you end up with a....dropped anime? I was anticipating watching Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso after hearing that is is an award winning manga about a musical child prodigy learning to face his demons, with a bit of romance thrown in. If done right, this could have been another gem to add to the multiple other music-based anime out there. But instead it seems that almost everything went wrong.

The protagonist of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is Kousei, an unbelievably talented musician who's mother's death has been haunting him, so much
                  ...
so that he cannot play anymore. Since then he's found life fairly meaningless, apart from moments of happiness with his two best friends; Tsubaki and Ryouta. Then one day he meets a near perfect-looking girl his age who is also a violinist and has arrived to change his world. There's nothing wrong with this premise; in fact there are many enjoyable films with the ""depressed male meets manic pixie dream girl"" premise. What follows is where the problems begin.

The first problem arises when Kousei is describing the loss of his musical ability. Instead of saying something a regular person would say, such as ""I don't like it anymore"", Kousei says he ""cannot hear the music anymore"". When I heard him say this I thought that it was just a bit melodramatic, nothing more. However, now that I look back I can see why he uses these words. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso wants to be a feels trip, but doesn't know how. So it turns the drama dial to the max, even if things don't seem natural. The characters don't speak like normal people. Every line of dialogue (outside of the attempts at humour) is portrayed to have some deep meaning for them. 

This is emphasised by the constant monologuing and flashbacks. Kousei isn't just seen struggling to play music, he'll have a discussion in his head about how difficult everything is and then there'll be flashbacks of his mother abusing him. He won't just have a few scenes showing that he struggles with girls (even though his best friend is a female - which is generally far more than what most guys have at his age), he'll launch into a monologue about how he's ""always the sidekick"" - repeatedly. There's nothing wrong with the problems he is facing seeing as there are people who have gone through similar circumstances. But there is no need to constantly repeat and emphasise these issues in an attempt to create drama. 

Then there's the emotional and ""life-changing"" moments. The characters of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso are overcoming obstacles and creating new outlooks on life every few minutes. This is simply too much. This is where most critics start calling the show pretentious, which is understandable. No human being has the wisdom to come up with the realisations these characters do so frequently. No one reflects on their friendship, hobbies and place in life every second of the day. For a show that requires the viewer to relate to its characters, it does everything it can to achieve the opposite. 

The next issue is Kaori and the cliches. Now, I don't believe that cliches are inherently wrong. Especially considering almost every adventure film involves the same plot devices. However, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso even failed to do cliches right. This is where Kaori comes in. She is meant to be an MPDG; the girl that comes in to Kousei's life to change his world. But, like the drama, this is turned up to the max. Everything about Kaori is meant to be perfect. She's happy-go-lucky, loves music, intelligent, willing to show her emotions, beautiful, gets along with children and has a massive interest in our protagonist. They even throw in that she's sick and dying in case everything else didn't receive an emotional response. However, due to how overboard they've gone to make her a MPDG, it's actually made even fans of the show to have some dislike for her. When she is pushing Kousei to play with her, the show is attempting to portray her as encouraging Kousei to come out of his shell, but it comes across as borderline bullying. Her character is simply a trope gone wrong.

The cliches continue for the other characters and it makes it predictable. Tsubaki clearly has feelings for Kousei but will end up accepting that Kousei does not reciprocate. Ryouta will not change at all and is only there to create a love triangle. Kaori's sickness will end up getting worse, but before dying she'll reveal that the whole time she loved Kousei. Kousei will end up coming out of his shell and still love Kaori even after she's gone. The side characters will come and go without doing much and each episode will be padded out with flashbacks and monologues. It is obvious what's coming and really only has content to last a film, not a whole 20+ episode series.

After all that rambling about the negatives (and there are more, but mostly minor at this point), there are some positives. The artwork in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is wonderful to look at. Take a screenshot at any point in most episodes and you would have a good wallpaper. The animation is fairly decent, especially when the effort is put in to the concert performances. The music throughout the show is brilliant and the choice of songs throughout are actually very appropriate. The OP is incredibly catchy and as much as I didn't enjoy the show, I still enjoy listening to the OP. 

So, if you enjoy forced melodrama with music involved, then you might get more out of this show than I did. However, there are definitely better drama-based anime out there, even with music being a focus. Personally, I'm just disappointed knowing that this show could have been much better."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"Character progression, art style, story. This series takes these values to heights that make film critics shimmer with satisfaction and guarantees it a solid rating.

I, however, am no film critic. I'm a simple guy donning simple tastes and battling with depression. Personally, I wish I never watched this. 

To my untrained ear, the music seemed monotonous throughout the series and continued to carry a tone of despair and solitude.

Through my simplified vision, the art style seemed forced and uncomfortable.

In my dull and shallow mind, the story felt overly romanticized and stagnant.

Through my naivety, I blindly became attached to the characters, and forced myself to watch
                  ...
them struggle through a life that is less than they deserve.

I sit here, having finished the final episode, wondering why things end up the way they do, and why we are so powerless against it.

This review may be absolutely worthless to anyone who stumbles upon it, but I had to find somewhere to express my experience before I do something far more stupid on impulse."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"""Your Lie In April"" is a transparent attempt to pull at your heartstrings, and it works well.

The best part of this anime is how it ties character growth to musical ability.  You can have fantastic piano technique, but if you're temperamental, immature, or just plain boring, it will come across in your music.  Kousei's character growth comes across well in his playing, and that goes for the other characters too.  The show manages to make multi-episode piano competitions interesting, which is itself quite the accomplishment.

The other good part is how it depicts the characters' struggles to figure out what they want from
                  ...
life.  Becoming a world-class musician requires immense sacrifice, and finding the motivation to pour your heart into one of Chopin's Etudes for the hundredth time is no small task for a child.  The struggle to produce collides head-on with the cold reality that sometimes you're just not good enough... something that's mirrored in the athletic careers of Kousei's two friends.

The characters are well done all around.  They all get to show their strong and weak sides, they have motivations and doubts, they lie and do things that they'll regret.  Kousei's mentor, Seto, is refreshing when she arrives, because she brings both a mature perspective to the situation as well as a more adult set of problems.

But there are two issues.

First, this anime has no business being 22 episodes long.  There is simply not 22 episodes worth of content.  It matches the source material rather closely, but I would rather have seen a couple filler episodes with new content rather than have it stretched out so much.  Some parts drag on a bit, and in a few parts, the events are depicted in anachronic order to pad out the time a bit.

Second, the drama is far too obvious.  Did you see the ending coming?  You should have.  This is a very ""architected"" plot: everything that happens supports the plot, and the characters never get the opportunity to go off the rails.

Reviewers on this site are a bit too fond of shows that try to make you cry.  This show currently sits at #14, not far below ""Clannad: After Story"" at #6.  Yes, ""Your Lie In April"" is good, but it's not that good.  It hits all the right notes but it never gives you any doubt about what's going to happen next.  You'll enjoy the show but it will never challenge you."

                                      (15/22 eps)","After watching the last episode I thought to myself, ""Was it worth it?"" The answer to that question is a simple, no. I had very high hopes for this anime and it failed to meet my expectations (perhaps they were a bit too high). BUT at least Shigatsu gripped me, gripped me by the ball sack and wouldn't let go i mean.

Although I have only watched 15 episodes I still believe that it was not worth my time. (I did see the last episode though)

The art of Shigatsu is very appealing and the animation was at least consistent but nothing I would call amazing. The
                  ...
piano playing was all done in cg, making the hands look very much out of place. 

The sound is absolutely wonderful, often being exactly on point with the current scene and adding so much more to the atmosphere. I greatly enjoyed both openings of the anime and found the endings to also be fitting. 

The story of Shigatsu is simple but also had much potential. The way the start of the series was, in my belief, handled well enough. There weren't many to any plot holes in the entire story that I could see but, it went in a very very slow pace causing me to feel a slight dread within the bottomless pit that is my heart. The comedic relief scenes also felt very out of place and quite awkward, tearing me completely out of immersion. The problem with the scenes were not that they were just there to relieve the tension, as they are meant to, but that they were poorly done.    

The biggest flaw of Shigatsu is certainly its two main characters. First, Kousei. He definitely develops, as he competes with his old rivals to claim the top spot and along the way understands just how much of an impact he had on these other people. And through his interactions with the heroine he is able to move on and continue to purse being a pianist. However Kousei is, in my eyes, a boring main character that gives the viewer an overall depressing feeling. There just isn't enough things about him that can make up for his monotone character. 
Kaori was also another character that didn't resonate with me. Sure she was fun loving and ""care free"" but those characteristic just felt forced into her character. If she was a side character I think that I would have been fooled into believing she was actually having fun in the scenes but she (and other characters) very much overreact to such scenes. Another part of her that made me dislike her was that she didn't clearly convey her emotions to the other members, maybe even manipulating other ""major"" characters (one might say). She also had a very aggressive attitude to Kousei (for no real reason) causing me to instantly dislike her. 
A large problem with the other members of the cast including Kaori, was that they forced Kousei who had PTSD to instantly do the thing that is part of his trauma without any kind of ACTUAL help or any easing into it. 

The melodrama was also very heavy. So heavy that even I couldn't handle it. The constant repeating of words also annoyed me. The constant reuse of the word over and over again withing the span of a few seconds felt awkward and felt like they were trying to invoke a feeling (WHICH I DID NOT FEEL) down my throat.

Overall the episodes, including the last one, were not very compelling. The only reason I got as far as I did was because I had hope that it would turn into something greater than it was and because my friends were also watching it. I do feel like my expectations were a bit high for this anime but I also feel that I gave it a fair score despite my hopes. 

I may re watch and maybe actually finish the anime in a year or so once my thoughts on the anime are not quite as vivid as they are now.
If my thoughts in the future change I may come back to edit but for now, Dropped."

Music is the only language which people of all nationalities are capable of understanding. It is a unique method of sending messages to one another and to understand one another. It's a conversation through instruments. In that sense, music transcends words.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a deeply melodramatic story about love and life itself, and how the aspect of music can be used to affect both. It is one of
                  ...
very few anime which actually revolves around classical music, and it does so in a stunning fashion the likes of which hasn't been seen since Nodame Cantabile.

If you just want a short summary of what Shigatsu (I'll just refer to it as such henceforth) is about, and why you should or should not watch it, then here's a quick rundown of it. Otherwise the full review follows below:



Pros & Cons:

+ One of very few anime which to a large extent revolves around classical music
+ Very poetic writing and an abundance of intricate monologues
+ Lots of character facades where there are a ton of bottled up thoughts and feelings inside all of the characters which they don't show to anyone else
+ Absolutely beautiful music with exquisite presentation and an incredibly captivating atmosphere. If you would discount all other factors of this anime, then really the audio department alone is honestly enough of a reason to watch it

+/- Very slow pacing during live performance sessions, but as long as you can lean back and just appreciate the beautiful classical music then it's not really an issue
+/- A minor love polygon is present, though it's definitely not the main focus of the show
+/- Highly melodramatic – this can either be interpreted as it being beautiful and emotional or cheesy and cliché, depending on who you ask

- Highly predictable plot development overall; you can pretty much sketch out how the entire anime will play out after just a handful of episodes
- Poor usage of comic relief and overall bad timing of non-serious moments



Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (or ""Your Lie in April"" in English) primarily follows the life of Arima Kousei; a diligent and strictly trained piano prodigy who dominated all the classical music competitions during his childhood. However after having a traumatic experience along with the death of his mother, he suffered a mental breakdown and completely lost his ability to play the piano. That is until two years later when he one day happens to stumble upon his polar opposite in the form of Miyazono Kaori; a beautiful and energetic young violinist who tries to live her life to the fullest. She begins to show Kousei the wonders and beauty of music and tries to teach him that he should play the piano not because he can or must, but because he wants to.

Initially, the setting seems fairly familiar as we have Kousei basically restarting from rock bottom of his life, but with the help of his friends his vast potential slowly starts to reveal itself over the course of time. Along with this, the anime provides us with some absolutely exquisite live classical music performances which give the series its own flair as well as a fantastic atmosphere more often than not. However as is also made evident as the story progresses, that is not the only thing that Shigatsu has to offer, as it gets gradually more and more depressive and tragic, resulting in a great deal of a little certain something we most often refer to as ""melodrama"".

This is the real make-or-break factor of the entire show.  The melodramatic elements in the latter portion of the anime are highly prevalent and affect the story quite drastically. Now some people will find this absolutely beautiful and touching since the anime does become extremely emotional as it tries to draw out as much ""feels"" as possible from its viewers. On the other hand many other people will instead claim that this only made the story cheesy and cliché as a result of bad writing. And honestly... I can't really say either side is wrong. Melodrama by itself is neither a good nor a bad thing, but it will cause some rather extreme reactions from its viewership. If the anime succeeds in bringing out the emotions from you as it tries to do, then you'll probably love this show. On the other hand if it doesn't, it'll probably just make you roll your eyes in exasperation. It's an extremely individual matter, and thus the only real recommendation I can make as far as that goes is to simply try it out and see for yourself. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't, but it's at least worth giving it a chance.

Now if I could mention something which I would actually label as a problem however, then it would rather be the way the story as a whole is structured. This is simply because as it is, the plot developments of Shigatsu are for the most part highly predictable. You really don't need to watch very far into it before you will most likely have a reasonable estimation of how the rest of the story will play out, and there are very few moments where it actually manages to surprise you. This fact may also indirectly reduce the impact that many of the show's emotional peaks contain, not because they're poorly written but simply because you will probably see them coming beforehand.

Kousei comes across as your fairly typical admirable protagonist with a tragic past. He's shy and quiet but he is very caring for those who are close to him. Out of all the characters, Kousei's development is by far the most noticeable as the changes he goes through over the course of the story are quite massive, and his extensive monologues give you a really good insight on what is going on inside his head. Kaori on the other hand is what I at first glance would have described as the anime character personification of Lindsey Stirling, which made me personally very excited as I've always been a huge fan of hers. She has a very cheerful and outgoing personality (albeit lightly tsun at times) which makes her the trusted mood maker of the cast. She tends to keep her private life more secretive however and doesn't like to let other people know what she's going through very much, but she certainly has a fair share of development as well. The other two main characters of the show, Kousei's two friends Tsubaki and Ryouta, are both somewhat neglected in this area though I feel, especially the latter one. I think this is a bit unfortunate because in all honesty the two of them have surprisingly big supportive roles in this anime.

Anyhow, for the most part I would still have to say that Shigatsu is a very enjoyable anime. Especially the live music segments are exquisite, and although the pacing tends to slow down to a snail's pace during them, at the time the show still manages to completely captivate you as a viewer by just how well it is presented and how beautiful it is. I haven't read the manga admittedly (yet?) but I have a very hard time seeing Shigatsu being as good without the presence of audio. It really is the department where the anime shines the brightest.

The animation for Shigatsu was done by A-1 Pictures, and as you may expect from them, almost everything in the show looks very crisp and clean. I did have some minor issues with the almost exaggeratedly rounded faces in the first few episodes though, but I got used to it pretty quickly thereafter. The bottom line is, the anime looks beautiful when it tries to... *when* it tries to that is...

Which brings me to the second problem I have with this show, namely its utilization of comedy. Every so often, the animation quality will deteriorate drastically and reduce the character designs to more chibi-like designs in typical shounen-comedy fashion, and then it tries to incorporate some average comic relief gags into it. Case in point: this entire aspect of the show *should not have existed*. At all. Let's be real here, regardless of whether or not the anime is in a segment where it's focusing on character interaction, music or drama, it always feels serious. The general atmosphere of this story is stylish and dramatic, as you would expect from a story revolving around classical music to such a large extent. The last thing I would ever want to see thrown into that mix is cheap chibi comedy; it breaks the atmosphere apart like no tomorrow. It's so incredibly needless and off-putting, and I can't for the life of me figure out why it was implemented to begin with. If you look at Nodame Cantabile for example which has a very similar premise, that show still manages to incorporate comedy despite its mature and dignified atmosphere. It almost feels like Shigatsu was aimed at the wrong target audience, and as if it would have been better off being aimed at adults, perhaps even women primarily. I mean I understand that the main characters here are all middle schoolers but still.

Even with that taken into account however, at the end of the day what you have is an anime where the pros still heavily outweigh the cons... *unless* you're unable to stomach the melodramatic aspects that is. However that is something you will have to find out for yourself. Personally I'd like to believe I'm fairly neutral as far as that matter goes as I neither love or hate it, and with that in mind then I still definitely liked Shigatsu a lot overall.


Recommended for:
Fans of emotional dramas and classical music, as well as those who can truly appreciate exquisite presentation for what it is

Not recommended for:
People who believe solid writing carries more weight than emotional impact, and also those who for some reason don't like classical music to begin with


Overall, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso still stands as one of the more memorable (and conclusive) romance anime in recent years, and while I can't call it the best ever it still definitely stands out for what it is. Although it is certainly far from flawless, it still goes to show that that isn't really necessary anyway. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and in Shigatsu's case it provides us with an anime that although it's far from perfect, it's still a hell of a lot better than most."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"First of all, I do not love it because it is popular. I'm French and nobody knows it in France. So, nope, I've just been told by a friend about Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.
I'll try to organise my review: we'll first talk about the plot. Then, we'll talk about the music. After, we'll deal with the characters. Last, but not least, we'll ""judge"" the animation.

So, let's begin with the plot: fabulous. Yet, the original speech looked classical: Kosei was a great pianist, ""the human metronome"", who was able to play perfectly every score, as if the original composer was playing. Today, being fourteen, he
                  ...
doesn't play the piano anymore, because of a trauma I won't spoil, and see a monochromatic world, the same colours as a music sheet or a piano keyboard. But comes in his life an excentric and free-spirited violonist, named Kaori, playing the score the way she wants to. She will try to make Kosei's love for piano and music reappear. Yes, we could have thought the plot would be: ""Kosei unhappy. → He meets Kaori. → She helps him playing piano. → It's hard though. → She doesn't forsake. → Kosei is alive again. →  They fall in love and live happily ever after."" Well, perhaps it's a little bit more complicated. The work doesn't use music in order to deliver a cheesy shojo. It's more ""a slice of life"", even if Wikipedia and Mangafox describe it as a shonen. No matter what, it's a real love letter to music. We insist on the emotions music can make us feel, and it's amazing! Love, anger, loneliness, sadness, determination, the panel is pretty wide. And it's really strong. We're told that it's this way of playing which will make our music etch in people's hearts. We've got a reflection about music, but about the place of the artist as well: must they be what people expect them to be? Or must they be themselves, but being people that no-one understands? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also proposes a reflection about the surfacing of love feelings, about seeing your beloved far away, about traumas, about mourning and so on. It's pretty good. And to insist on these ideas, several symbols are given to the spectator, free to interpret as they wish: spring, cherry tree's flowers, piano, music at bottom, stars and even trains (the only thing I cannot interpret). Yet, there's still some little faults: the beginning of the second part. That Kosei faces his trauma at the beginning of this part, according to me, should have been at the end of the first part: moreover, the 10th episode was excellent because it had already concerned that and the battle looked like it was led. In my notes, I've even suggerated an achievement of the hero. But, fortunately, this accomplishment is completed at the 13th episode (the second episode of the second part): it's not worth grieving! Especially as the humour is particularly excellent. For the plot, I let me give a 5/5, deserved.

Let's deal with the music. We have got Chopin's. I think it is enough to show how excellent it is. The ""songs"" we listen are extremely well played, it's a feast for our ears. The original score is effective, and even though it is not unforgettable, it's able to be mixed with ""classical music"" (I use ""classical"" because I can't make a difference between ""classical music"", ""baroque music"" and so on, even if I hardly recognise the romantic music.) Endings and openings are excellent. Especially openings. Especially the second one. Music is enchanting, and pictures' representation is superb. Fine art. All of this work's music (opening, ending, original score and intradiegetic) is well done. In a nutshell, the music, without surprising nobody, 5/5.

Then, characters: most of them are interesting. The hero is well made. A musician not hearing the piano when he concentrates on playing: it was ambitious! So, we have a character traumatised, totally empty, monochromatic, and who has got nothing to prove to the world, and to himself too. Yes, he will change (luckily, seeing a depressive character the whole work on wouldn't have been worth seeing, it's only well done in Life). He will colour his world thanks to Kaori, extrovert and free-spiritied musician. Kaori, who is, all the same time, an excellent character. All of the characters are excellent, and I won't be able to develop without spoiling, because all of them are suprising. Even some characters you discover after a lot of episodes and who are not that present are amazing. Nevertheless, there is one flaw: Watari (what an unluck, it's one of the main characters!). He didn't seem really developed. I thought it was an empty character that they wanted to contrast with the hero (you will understand how they are constrated by watching the anime). But we understand that he's got a willing making him cry. Is he developed or isn't he? If he weren't supposed to be developed, why this little development? If he were, it's not enough. Conclusion? It kills me admiting that but... it's... a... *clearing his throat* non-sense... Regarding Tsubaki, in order to complete the square of teenagers, she is extremely well made and deep. Characters, 4,75/5, but because of Watari.

The animation only confirms the rest. Super. Grandiose. They have really good ideas, really good effects. I mean, representing Kosei non-hearing the sounds playing piano by diving him in the water is an excellent idea. Landscapes are detailed, the characters, amazing to look, and lots of efforts are made: we have even got sentences on t-shirts (the ""No Life Is Enough"" made me laugh). Animation is intelligently between 2D and 3D. Even if it's not the best 3D ever (*sweet looks to Disney and Pixar*), it's enough to what it represents, and, in addition to that, rare enough for not bothering. Moreover, it's not that far from the 2D animation, it's pretty good. It's not like if they used that for the whole show (isn't it, KIRARIN REVOLUTION 3?). Yes, I find the animation superb, splendid, intra/extradiegetic plans are excellent, beautiful work, 5/5.

To put it in a nutshell, is it neat? You have understood: a masterpiece. Even a big  one. 19,75/20 (=9,875/10, so let me give 10/10) isn't from nowhere. People say you can judge something only when it is finished: it is finished and superb! The beginning, the middle, the end: everything verges on genius! Excellent things, a rich and mastered universe (just one little non-sense), you've got everything to have a good time. This anime is an excellent ""mise en abyme"" of its aim: it offers you anything it has got in order to stay in your heart forever. Your Lie in April, as it is translated is a pure masterpiece, the centrepiece of shonen and ""slice of life"" mangas, a delicious work deserving more than a glance: it deserves your heart, your soul and your passion. Ears welcome."

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

In a world where every teenager is a philosopher. Where every decision is backed up by a few minutes of brooding monologue, as the extremely obvious is explained repeatedly exists a show that is deeply flawed simply due to it's own genre trappings. 

Your Lie In April is that show. In this review I will probably be harsher than perhaps I should be, however, watching all twenty two episodes elicited a very interesting reaction from me. One of frustration, exasperation, lost potential, and maybe just a little bit of hope. 

A show that could've done so much right. A show that is dragged down by
                  ...
shallow themes, weak romance, appalling humor, limp characterization, and most importantly, a fetish for trying to make you cry. A fetish that gets extremely tedious to sit through. 

In this review I aim to explain my dislike of many of these elements, however, I also want to touch on the hidden potential that occasionally shines through the cloying husk of this empty, repetitive show. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[MUSIC]

So this show is about music. Specifically piano, however, it touches on just the broad strokes of the idea of music. The vague notion of what music can do to a person. The expression in music. This is actually kind of cool. One, because there is a sorry lack of shows that are about music. Two, because I love music!

Unfortunately, these themes are explained. Yes. Quite often. However, the show rarely ever demonstrates what it explains. The raw emotion of the piano is so powerful. Nonetheless, the show tries its hardest to bury one of the prettiest instruments under a blanket of monologuing and exposition. 

While this is pretty common for Shounen anime, it was particularly frustrating in Your Lie. The whole point of music is that it doesn't need to be explained. Why the hell would they keep trying to explain it? This is where there simply needed to be liberties taken in adapting this show from the Manga. You can't hear music from a comic strip, so it makes sense to have characters listening discuss the impact it is having on them.

However, why would they include this into the show? What benefit does explaining something you can hear have? None. It takes one of the shows biggest and most repetitive themes of expression through music, specifically ""reaching"" someone through song, and spits in its face. Especially when there are constant cuts away from the actual music to flashbacks or characters you simply don't care about, like contest judges, monologuing about how ""oh man, this dude is good at the piano cause he is using emotion to play!"" Man, I wish I could hear this emotion! I wish there wasn't just snippets of this emotion they keep talking about!

...

With that being said, though, the big scenes involving piano and violin are absolutely jaw-dropping to look at. A-1 pictures, a studio I really didn't know had it in them, really went all out with little details. Fingers strumming the keys, the way a pianist flicks his wrists. It's all meticulously done. Of course there are bouts of time-saving still images that permeate through the shows middle half. Unfortunately, for as solid as the art is overall, these budget-saving and time-saving aspects are understandable, but i'd be lying if I said they didn't effect my overall enjoyment of the show. 

These huge musical extravaganza's rarely get to breath, as I said, constantly being interspersed with monologues and exposition. This, however, has a nice turn with the final episode where that breathing room is finally given. It makes for a somewhat worth it wait, although I have to ask myself If I would have enjoyed the show more if every scene like this was made to express, rather than to explain. 

...

The music itself is great, too. The pieces picked are all very beautiful. I found myself looking up the composition after it was played just to experience it outside of the show. They nailed the sound here. 

While the opening was generally just OK, the closing tracks were gorgeous. Especially the one in the second half of the show. In fact, it's so pretty, that it almost feels as though it doesn't belong in a show that wears it's melodrama on its sleeve. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[ART]

So the character designs are generally pretty good too. The art, as I've said, is almost always pretty to look at. The characters are all fairly memorable (in design), and flaunt unique traits... such as lips. Which is pretty interesting for an anime. This stylistic choice actually really grew on me and I found myself really enjoying how expressive this simple addition could make a character.

The art design isn't perfect, though. I found there being a huge dissonance between the characters at the forefront of the story and the same characters as seen in flashbacks. A simple two year flashback would revert these characters into blabbering children that looked like they were around six or seven, while the present had them at the ""mature"" age of fourteen, where they looked more like they were around twenty. That, unfortunately, I never got used to. 

Every girl in the show wears hilariously short skirts. It's a weird thing to notice but I just couldn't help but laugh at this shows need to market these characters. There's something so weird about a character that looks distinctly mature, however, is just a fourteen year old girl with an incredibly short skirt. It's ridiculous to even imagine this kind of shit being applicable in the real world. It's like a bunch of older girls doing sexy cosplays of schoolgirls, rather than actual schoolgirls. It wasn't the smartest choice by the design team. 

...

For it's music, the animators use extremely pretty CG to animate the fingers and the piano. On occasion there were a few textures that didn't blend too well with the cell-shaded characters, however, for the most part, the pianos and the hands playing them looked spectacular. I wish there was a bit more creativity put into the shot composition of these scenes, though, as I felt like I saw the same exact swooping shot of Arima's fingers strumming the keys multiple times. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[STORY, CHARACTER, AND THEMES]


So inevitably I have to touch on what truly bothered me about this show. Because the sound and music are generally spectacular. The characters, the story, and the thematic elements were all fairly weak in Your Lie. In fact, they were straight up lazy. 

A few unique elements into the generic ""love triangle"" were injected with the fact that the show really didn't have any villains. It was kind of refreshing to see the competition against Arima, our protagonist, were all well-meaning people who respected him greatly. Seeing this support each other was awesome and it makes me wish that the show really didn't have romance in it at all. 

But it does. Oh boy does this show have romance. In fact, I'd say the amount of romance dwarfs any musical elements this show shows off. Just about every scene was plagued in melodrama. Just... plagued. I always disliked melodrama because it felt like something injected into a story just to stir conflict, rather than create progress. 

The amount of melodrama in Your Lie is simply exhausting. Every scene played out so similarly, with such a low variety of topics, that I felt like I watched the same episode three or four times on occasion. That's really bad for a show that only runs twenty two episodes. 

...

""Uh Oh, blonde girl lost her pencil! Watch as she looks at her hands and we get a PoV shot of her crying!"" There is literally nothing more frustrating than seeing a show try, and fail, to make you feel sad about shit. Instead of developing characters, as in, making them like-able to begin with. Your Lie makes the bold move of just giving us emotional conflict right off the bat. 

We hardly know these characters and they're already crying. This doesn't make me feel attached to them. In fact, I just found myself annoyed most of the time. No, I don't fucking care that Pixie Dream Girl is having health problems because I DON'T KNOW HER. Every piece of information about her is fed so ham-handedly that I never felt like I could connect myself with the heroine of the story. 

She plays generic Pixie Dream Girl. If you don't know what that is, it's a character archetype that pretty much enters our protagonists life seemingly out of nowhere and inhabits this playful, cheery persona that sweeps them off their feet and has the protagonist do things he usually wouldn't do. These characters also often have sad backgrounds. This is the definition of Kaori, the blonde girl who does stuff and plays the violin... once or twice, I guess. 

And so the story begins of kids caring too much about shit I couldn't care less about. I suppose that's the problem with the genre. Maybe i'm just really not into melodrama. I personally didn't know that the show was going to be literally 90% melodrama. 

Especially since Kaori is less of a character and more of a tool for Arima to develop. However, this tool is so mediocrely portrayed and boring that I found myself with a mild disdain for her throughout the entire series. Which is sad since Your Lie has proven that it can write interesting characters with Arima's mom, Saki, who is this sympathetic character that has done horrendous things. It's hard to write a character like that and the show does so extremely well.

It's just sad that that's where it ends. The show really is just filled with the most generic possible characters apart from that. 

We have...

---> Oblivious love interest number 2. 

---> Sports guy

---> That friend who gives advice and is quirky

---> Younger girl that likes protagonist

---> Rivals who secretly know that they are worse than the protagonist

---> Other characters i'm forgetting. 

...

The themes aren't handled much better, either. For example : ""Maybe the light can reach the bottom of a dark ocean,"" is not only a quote, but also a prominent theme throughout most of the show. Arima being pretty much Shinji from Evangelion, but less interesting. So much so that we get direct homages to Shinji's hand. We see Arima's teenage angst being portrayed as though he is at the bottom of the ocean. It's dark, wet, and without sound. 

That's a fine theme to touch on. Maybe even build a deeper story within. However, ironically, this theme about a deep ocean is incredibly shallow and surface-level. Yet it gets explained so often, and so bluntly, that I found myself rolling my eyes constantly at the screen.

This can be said about everything in this series. Everything is explained. Nothing gets to breath or marinate in your mind. If a motif is teased, get ready for it to be explained directly to your face. It gets so tiresome to hear the same thing being said in a slightly different way five times, only to move on to an equally shallow and obvious theme that is done the same exact way. 

Wow, I never have heard love being compared to the seasons. Wow. What a creative and original idea. Maybe if they... nope, they're just gonna go ahead and say love is like the seasons forty seven times so you get that the weather around the characters is supposed to resemble their budding love. 

... 

So we have this Catcher in the Rye-esq edge to the protagonist that gets humdrum by episode four, but what truly is offensive is the fact that all of this edge is delivered like a punch to the mouth. With extensive monologues. I'm talking pages and pages of characters speaking into thin air. Dreary and endless doesn't even begin to cover how obnoxious this was.

Especially since hearing these fourteen year olds wax poetically about love is something that may have been interesting to me when I was fourteen, but now that I've grown up and realized that a crush on a girl in highschool isn't love. And most definitely doesn't deserve this much attention. It's not even a friendship that develops, I never get the idea that these characters are friends first, romantic interests second. It's all just romance in the most hackneyed possible way. 

Even if these characters are just actually supposed to be edgy teenagers, it doesn't really do the show any favors by not making a comment about that concept. No, I don't find a kid being edgy interesting. It's more of a joke. Ironically, a funnier joke than anything this show can muster up. Have I mentioned how unpleasantly unfunny this show is? It's anime reaction humor that is so misplaced and awkward that it wasn't just unfunny, it was cringe-inducing at times. 

Kids don't talk like this. Kids don't act like this. I don't care that he's a piano prodigy. The show never makes me care that he is a piano prodigy because the piano takes a sideline to more melodrama. A love triangle that spins its wheels until an axle breaks and it finally hits a lamp post and dies. Finally. 

...

If this isn't annoying enough, the protagonist is literally the center of the galaxy in this show. Every scene that doesn't include him is about him. Every scene that he's in, is about him. I get that he's the protagonist, but by making every character live off him makes the entire world feel unnatural and artificial. Two girls walk down the street. What do they talk about? I'll give you one guess. 

These characters have no discernible lives apart from talking about the main character. It makes sense for someone like Tsubaki to go on and on about Arima because she gets the glorious roll of the most retarded, unaware girl in the show. But the real kicker is that she doesn't even get a resolution. She's just another girl fawning over the protagonist. 

I get that these kinds of shows are marketed towards teenage boys. Usually lonely teenage boys. And by including cute girls that secretly love them it gives these lonely teenage boys the ability to insert themselves into the position of the main character and pretend like they have cute anime girls wanting to suck their cock. I also get that Arima, unlike a lot of anime protagonists, is actually very talented at the piano. But it doesn't make the fact that literally every important girl character in the show is literally in love with him.

I say ""literally"" in love,  because this show is so self-absorbed and unaware of it's ridiculousness that when a fourteen year old says ""I love you,"" you are supposed to actually take it seriously. As if he found his soul mate. It's a joke. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[CONCLUSION]

Is it clear yet that I have quite a few gripes with this show? If it weren't for the outstanding production and sound this show's grade would be fairly abysmal. It genuinely couldn't ring a single emotion out of me. That is not good for a show that's entire purpose was to ring emotion out of you. It's as if it's trying to milk a cow and it's not satisfied until ever last drop is squeezed out. 

The main character, piano prodigy Arima, is pretty much friend zoned throughout the entire show. Except he's an anime protagonist so it turns out every important girl ""loves"" him. 

The ridiculous themes, while extremely pretty in execution are incredibly empty. There is no substance to them so the show needs to repeat the same thing over and over again just to fill its run-time. I wouldn't call the show slow paced because I think that the pacing is all over the place. One episode is just a monologue stating something that a four year old could figure out, another episode has fifteen plot points it needs to resolve.

There's this weird dialogue-driven structure where a character just repeats a phrase throughout an entire episode. It's really corny and sometimes kind of unintentionally hilarious. Talking about hilarious, this show is the opposite of that. It's so unfunny that I actually felt kind of depressed after every joke it forced down your throat. 

It had a few unique elements in it's genre archetype, as the general lack of villains and excess of competitors gave it a very unique and somewhat interesting vibe when it came to the actual concerts. However, these concerts really don't play a huge roll in anything but furthering melodrama. As I said, the expression through music is almost always dampened by rampant cutting into loud, obvious, and repetitive dialogue. Thankfully the show at least let the final, astounding bravado performance breath and it was spectacular to look at, even if I never really found myself attached to any of the characters. 

...

I never really enjoyed melodrama. I think if I knew this show would have so much of it I would have stayed far away from it. It's not necessarily a bad show, in fact, my grade goes to show that it is but a woefully mediocre one. Which is sad because of how astounding some of the artistic elements are. That's where the topic of potential is ignited. 

This show left me frustrated because it could've been so much more interesting if it axed every single romance element and became a show about a kid overcoming his own issues through music. Instead, it became a show about a kid overcoming his own issues through a girl telling him about music. Letting him explore a kind of expression in music he wasn't familiar with. Which sounds interesting in theory, but the amount of exposition through obvious themes ruined any potential for an interesting romance.

Romance isn't inherently bad. However, the characters in said romance need to likable. Arima is simply a perfect human being that was stricken with understandable stress. If he didn't go through what he did he'd be this nice, handsome, great guy with awesome friends and a happy life. This lack of actual flaws to the character apart from maybe being shy on occasion remove any actual relate-ability to him. I can't relate to his reaction to anything because the reaction is so cloying rather than raw. 

Your Lie is deeply flawed through its own genre trappings. It takes itself so seriously that you may find yourself grasping for air. There is no levity. No wit. No brevity. It's just this slow crawl to the finish line. It's a very pretty crawl filled with great animation on occasion, pretty characters and strong voice work. But it's not a crawl i'd recommend. Especially if you dislike melodrama. 

As I said, it's art and sound elevate a lacking product. The characters, story, and themes were weak and often too simple to explain potentially complicated situations. The music is beautiful but I can't say that's enough reason to watch something. A mediocre product, not because of it's lack of trying, but due to it's completely inconsistent nature. 

If you want to see expressionism through music, watch Whiplash. If you want to see a bunch of broody kids monologue and cry fourteen times per episode, watch Your Lie in April."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Mixed Feelings,"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, in English “Your Lie in April”, could have been a true masterpiece. A-1 Pictures has made efforts in that direction, creating a series that is flawless, technically speaking at least. The animation is well-cared-for and extremely fluid, to the point that it really gets close to perfection. It certainly does its job of capturing the viewer with its undeniable beauty, especially during the musical scenes. The soundtrack is just as fitting, with a selection of beautiful classical pieces. Also thanks to a great direction, A-1 Pictures gives its public some scenes it will never be able to forget. It's quite
                  ...
exciting so far, but unfortunately all that glitters is not gold. Behind this pleasant surface, in fact, Shigatsu hides many flaws.

An anime’s plot can easily be its weakest point, but this is not the case for Shigatsu: its plot, though not original, is rather likeable and eye catching. The way the plot is handled, though, is another matter entirely. Every scenes is exaggerated, thus becoming excessive and unrealistic. This is evident especially in the countless dramatic scenes, that after a while become melodramatic and annoying. Among all the tear-jerking themes, one of the worst is Kousei’s childhood trauma: it is presented again and again for almost half the series, obsessively. Some of the scenes are way too rough and brutal, and end up feeling very out of place. To make things worse this theme is treated with superficiality, which is a paradox given how much they insist on it. The lack of depth of this anime is always lurking behind its illusory seriousness though, and we have proof of this in the second half of the anime, which focuses on Kaori more. She has had her run of bad luck, just like Kousei, and her problems are treated in a very shallow way, like you would expect after enduring twelve episodes of flat drama.

But let’s explore another weak point of this series: the supporting characters. Calling them this is perhaps too kind, as they are more plot devices than actual characters. This is especially true for Tsubaki – Kousei’s childhood friend – and Ryouta – the popular guy friend. Each time the plot lingers on them, it is only because they have something to do with the main character. They do not exist per se, because they are supplementary to the main character. Some have said that Kaori herself is subordinate to Kousei and his development, and even if this statement should be taken with a grain of salt, I don’t feel like denying it completely.

The psychological characterization of the supporting characters is also terrible. We could say that there is only one female character in the entire anime. Kaori, Tsubaki, Nagi and Hiroko are the main female characters, and they are all, ALL similar. It is indeed baffling how the creator of this series, in the making of the characters, started from a basic tsundere girl, and then added some irrelevant additional traits here and there to create some diversity. But in the end they all have the same personality – tsundere, as mentioned above – and even the same relationship with the main character – all love him but struggle admitting it, thus choosing to punch him and shout at him for most of the series. Ryouta has not had a better fate: he does not show much throughout the series, but when he does it is only to fulfill the rival role, vital to the plot.

A positive note, however, goes to Kousei’s musician rivals: Takeshi and Emi. They both have a more original characterization. Even if they do not appear much in the series, they seem to have a personal role, not subordinated to Kousei’s character. I should mention however how forced and unrealistic their long-lasting admiration for Kousei is.

You would think Shigatsu’s flaws ended here, but nope. This anime fails at what was probably its main aim: transmitting to the viewer the beauty of classical music. The musical scenes are so boring they seriously compromise the anime’s pace. The public is lead to think that the director didn’t know how to make the viewer appreciate classical music. Instead of simply showing how beautiful a classical track can be, the director chose to add long interior monologues and exaggerated reactions of the public. Thus long minutes of beautiful classical music are weighed down by long soliloquies and the “omg, marvelous, I can see the colourful notes happily dancing in a flowering field!” of the public.  

In the end: is this anime worth watching? All things considered, it is not: its flaws outnumber its merits by far. If you like tear-jerking scenes and are willing to turn a blind eye on the problems I’ve mentioned, though, you might enjoy it. At the very least you will love the animation and the wonderful soundtrack. 

★★★ SCORE ★★★
- Plot: 1/3, unsatisfactory. Clichéd elements, exaggerated scenes, total lack of originality, unrealistic events.
- Characters: 1/3, unsatisfactory. Clichéd traits, undifferentatied personalities, flatness, lack of personal development. 
- Art: 3/3, above average. Good soundtrack, beautiful scenes, fluid animation, perfect framing. Direction overdid things a little in some scenes, but the final product is good nonetheless.
- Total: 5/10.

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"What a treat. I didn't pick up Shigatsu wa kimi no uso expecting much. The art style is a bit conservative,  and the musical love story is a well trodden path. While A-1's contributions to the Noitamina block include the memorable Ano Hana, they have also delivered the stale light novel adaptation Nanana's Buried Treasure, the infamous Fractale, and even this season a straightforward harem in Saekano. Fortunately, A-1 pictures  brought their A-game to Shigatsu, and in fact this is one of the better shows of the past year.

Shigatsu starts of as a verbose, slightly melodramatic series and stays that way. Arima Kousei
                  ...
is very conflicted about his mother's death, and he's going to let you know with some marathon-length monologues that span half-episode long piano performances. Other characters are similarly self-reflective, and the viewer might occasionally feel like they're at a confessional. 

Shigatsu is at its heart a tale about the things that hurt us but also make us move forward as individuals. Love, loss, and relentless dedication to a craft, in this case music. Most of the musicians in the series are pianists, except the lively Miyazono Kaori whose kinetic, off-the-rails violin performance inspires change in the diminished and sad Arima Kousei. In the second half the main character's brooding finally exits the stage and the cast of supporting characters is given more room to breathe life into the series. 

When you get swept into the emotional tides of Shigatsu's youthful, vibrant cast, it becomes an immersive experience. Due to its vary nature as a character and monologue-driven experience though, I think whether the viewer is sympathetic to the main characters or endears to its style of storytelling will hugely influence their enjoyment. While I ultimately did, the show really does drone on at times. Anime writers take note; sometimes concepts are simple enough they don't need to drag on for hundreds of lines.

Shigatsu really sets a high bar with its production values. The art style is a tad conservative but the use of colour and lighting really is sumptuous. Super-deformity, which is fairly ubiquitous across many shows, makes an appearance. While its use suits the show's humour, which often comes in short, abrupt bursts of comic relief, it isn't a good contrast with the relatively serious and realistic nature of the series. Perhaps best left in the manga? The animation on the whole is very solid nonetheless. The way the characters move convincingly with the piano during recitals is particularly impressive. The series also makes use of CG to animate piano playing, and while slightly off-looking, it's certainly preferable to badly animating it in 2D or conveniently avoiding it. 

The audio is clearly where Shigatsu ought to shine, and through a choice of classic piano pieces it indeed does. There are scenes where spectators at concerts, in monologue, evangelise the beauty of how emotions are conveyed in the performances. I'm honestly too tone deaf to tell, but listening to classic pieces is mesmerising regardless of whether the claimed level of personalisation is actually being conveyed. The show's actual OST is intensely forgettable. Shigatsu offers one audio gift to forgive its mediocre OST though; great voice acting. With monologues stretching for literally minutes at a time, having them delivered in a suitably emotional, almost breathless manner makes them feel more colourful.

During the relentless monologues and 3 episode long concerts in the first half, watching Shigatsu felt a bit like a chore, but after the half-way point, Shigatsu hits its stride and delivers a passionate, pitch-perfect drama about music, youth, and love. Ultimately, its workmanlike presentation and dialogue means the only way it stands out among similar shows is quality, but this level of quality and consistency in production is quite rare.

The ending absolutely ruined it for me. This anime feels very much like Clannad, in that it is pretty melodramatic. I personally prefer happy endings, and I wouldn't say this one has a happy ending. I personally feel frustrated after watching this.

There wasn't really much of a plot or story, the anime focuses mostly on the characters and their past. The flow of the anime is very inconsistent as well. You go from music, to competition, to love triangle, to very disappointing ending.

It's hard to describe more without

giving tons of spoilers so I'll leave it there. I'm not the best at writing detailed reviews as most would prefer, I can only leave my feelings here for anyone else that might find it useful. I really wanted to love this anime, and maybe in a sort of weird way I did, but overall I am disappointed and frustrated."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"I've finally got around to watching this anime just over a month ago. After I finished watching this anime, I was extremely disappointed. I've heard lots of good things about this anime, but unfortunately it ended up being a pathetic pile of shit. It wasn't even enjoyable to watch in the slightest. Also, I highly suggest that you don't read this review if you haven't already watched this anime yet. 

I'll just give a quick synopsis of the story since I'm sure you all know what it's about. The story is about how a kid named Kousei is abused and forced to play the piano
                  ...
by his abusive mother. Fast forward to a couple years later, the heroine Kaori is pretty much forcing him to start playing the piano again. Kaori is a violinist and she pretty much begs him to start playing piano again. This Kaori girl then gets some unknown disease, therefore she's unable to play the violin with Kousei. Throughought the anime we see her struggling with this disease, and I admit that it was kind of sad to watch.

The story is actually pretty interesting to be honest. I have no problem with the story of this anime at all. What I do have a problem with is the bad writing and poor execution. I actually expected this anime to be mature since it's touches on things like PTSD, Depression, Suicide, Disease, etc. Unfortunately, this anime was not mature in the slightest. Infact, this anime was extremely immature which kind of disappointed me. There was many moments of unfunny and unnecessary comedy that really shouldn't have been there. I mean for fucks sake, the characters in this show talk about comitting suicide. I seriously want to know what the writer was thinking when he decided to add childish comedy to a manga that has mature themes. 

The characters are just god awful and unlikeable it's ridiculous. The only one that developed as a character was Kousei. Every other character is one dimensional and unlikeable. I have no idea why people like Kaori. Just because she has a disease and the anime makes you feel sorry for her, that doesn't mean she's a good character. I felt bad for her aswell, but she's still a generic one dimensional character. I was disgusted at how annoying Tsubaki was. She's the most annoying female character I've ever seen in an anime, period. There's just way too many characters that serve no purpose to the story, such as Nagi, and the two people that are obsessed with Kousei. 

This show becomes extremely repetitive very fast. I mean the second half of the show is the same thing repeated over and over again ad nauseam. I literally felt like I was watching the same episode over and over again. The last 12 episodes have very slow pacing and it was a pain to watch them.

The animation was good at sometimes, but bad at other times. Anytime there's a piano/violin performance, there usually is beautiful animation. Unfortunately anytime there's a comedy scene, the animation is just god awful. The art style just completely changes when there is comedy involved and it's animated so ugly. It's as if there's comedy in this anime just for the sole purpose of saving budget. If that's actually the reason, then that's absolutely pathetic.

I just didn't enjoy this anime one bit. It was extremely childish and immature I just couldn't stand it. I didn't enjoy the characters because they were annoying pieces of shit. The performances were fun to watch at first, but quickly became boring because of the slow pacing. I didn't enjoy watching the bad comedy. This anime is just bad and overrated."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"(THIS REVIEW HAS SOME SPOILERS SO PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)

So this review is basically on Shigatsu wa Kimi (Japanese) or Your Lie in April (English). I have to say, this anime was pretty awesome but it had some major cliché stuff going on but I'm pretty sure I'd rate it as a must watch if you like the kind of touchy-touchy or romantic anime (I also use the word 'cliché' a lot so please don't be annoyed). And of course, I must state again that this review of Shigatsu wa Kimi has spoilers, so please read at your own risk. Anyways, enjoy this
                  ...
review!

STORY:
So, the story had some major problems. The protagonist, Arima Kousei, was a star pianist. That I get but then he stopped hearing the notes? Seriously? I mean, I guess it's supposed to be dramatic but seriously, this? I mean come on. And then the other protagonist, Miyazono Kaori, she had an illness that paralyzed her legs? Talk about cliché. And then all of a sudden she produced a violin out of thin air? Seriously? I seriously think that the sad scenes in the anime are forced but then again, it had some beautiful moments. I rate the story 6.

ART:
The art was seriously great. It was really vibrant, which of course I like. Sometimes it's a bit too bright for my eyes but it's cool, I can live. I s'pose that it had some minor blemishes but it's fine. I loved the character design for the protagonists though, like seriously. It was pretty cool. I rate the art a 9.

SOUND:
The sounds are awesome, it's pretty much beautiful but that would be an understatement. I mean, the opening song is flippin' amazing, at least two people saw me try to sing along with it in Japanese. The soundtracks are equally amazing too, well, what do you expect? This is an anime that features the infamous pianist, Arima Kousei, and the gorgeous violinist, Miyazono Kaori. I rate the sound a 10 but I do regret it that I can't rate the sound higher.

CHARACTER:
The character backgrounds are cliché, again. I mean, Arima lost his mom at a young age and then he quit violin? Come on. All I can say is cliché, cliché, cliché. And then all of a sudden, a girl changes his mind? And Kaori also had a past that was pretty.. how do I say it.. unoriginal? She was a frail child and had went through a lot of surgeries. Then she saw Arima at a music recital and was encouraged to meet him. Talk about cliché. But I guess I can't see how they could end it if they couldn't go cliché. I rate it 6, I guess.

ENJOYMENT:
I loved it, I really did. But the scenes where people cry over are pretty nonchalant to me. I feel as if the scenes are like you put sad anime songs in the background and then BOOM, you just start to bawl your eyes out. The thing is, the sad or ""feely"" scenes are pretty forced. But even so, I still enjoyed the anime even with all of it's forced scenes, cliché scenes, and so on. I'd rate the enjoyment a fair 6.

OVERALL:
The anime was pretty cliché (I'm sorry but I had to use the word again), but it was worth it. Again, it is a must watch (well, for me it is). I really did love this anime and I hope there's going to be a second season. This anime did have a few ups and downs but this is seriously one of the best anime I have watched (so far, and note, ""ONE OF"" the best, not the best) in the first-half of the year. It was amazing, really amazing. Loved every second of it (excluding the forced scenes)."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"So I went and checked out the hype train despite my busy sched and backlogs, and ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to report that the hype.. is real! Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) is a MUST WATCH specially for fans of classical music.

Kimi Uso, if I would put into imagery, is like trying out this Black Forest cake specialty that uses sour cherries at this new classical cafe everyone is talking about. You walk-in, greeted by the beautiful classical ambience, and when your order reaches the table, you see that it actually looks great and appetizing. You start tasting it
                  ...
but get disappointed, feeling that it does not live up to its reputation, but as you continue eating it, you realize that it has just the right amount of sweetness accompanied with sourness within each layer that gives good contrast and variety, perfect for your palate (well depending on your taste of course). Then when you finally get to the eat the whole cherry on top which you expected to be the dramatically and tear-jerkingly sour climax, you find out that it has this unique, indescribable anticlimactic taste of satisfaction instead.

Music, romance, humour, trauma, despair, realization, inspiration, change; I find this series having one of the best story concepts and premises I've seen to date. It starts out quite slow and only picks up half-way through, but you can really see the character development and it ends conclusively well, connecting everything, tracing back to episode one. It has good casting, with perfect setups for each character introduction; everyone fits-in and is significant. The only thing I did not like is the inconsistency, blandness or coldness I felt at the end because I was expecting more drama, more emotions, and my helpings of super tear-jerky scenes.

The story is paired with a beautiful art style consistent with what you can see on the cover and good selections of wonderful classical pieces that can attract people who are new to the genre. You will see fitting character designs, beautiful backgrounds and non half-assed (though sometimes repetitive or recycled) full concours audience with fully detailed expressions; and the most amazingly fluid instrument-playing animation with the most flashy, emotional performances you can experience to date. You will hear well selected voice acting and great, goose bump inducing classical piano and violin that I so love; and which Disney fans should look forward to because they also included Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty Waltz in a most awe-inspiring duet. Such budget. Much wow. This series is eye and ear candy.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is short but complete, and is well produced. I really enjoyed it; to the point that what was supposed to be a check of the pilot episode to pass a few minutes of my time during my visit to the beach, ended up being an all-nighter, that made me miss half a day of my beach vacation. People who liked music titles such as Nodame, Beck, Sakamichi Apollon, should definitely watch this. It is beautiful. It is amazing. It is so much worth.

P.S. I do not eat black forest cakes; that imagery is a lie I told you guys this April."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Shigatsu is an anime that has been highly praised ever since it's debut. Many people will enjoy and love this anime to death, and others will be able to see it's poor writing and blatant flaws (It seems that a large majority of MAL users are part of the former). 

Story: 6/10
The story of the anime has an in captivating premise, and retains a beautiful outer atmosphere while still exhibiting the true dark nature of the show. Kousei Arima, piano prodigy, experienced harsh child abuse from his mother, (although now deceased) which plays a key factor in his inability to perform to the best of
                  ...
his abilities in the present. The imagery is also very well used during Kousei's struggle to play the piano. 

The second half of the show is where things begin to crumble. The show undergoes a repetitive process where characters would perform in competitions and face the same turmoil and problems they experienced in previous performances. The plot also introduces characters here and there that were used as cheap plot devices in order to drive the characters to perform better. The melodrama is another aesthetic that was taken to a whole new level and even began to irritate me with how over the top it was. 

The pacing was very slow, and felt unnecessarily dragged in order to display the '""battles"" the characters experienced on stage. As I stated before, the anime withstood a repetitious plot, which didn't help with the poor pacing. 

Art/Animation: 8/10
This art in the anime is beautiful. The show is very colourful during performances, and uses darker and bleak colours during the depressing scenes. The animation is fluid and retains consistency throughout the entirety of the show. It never feels flat. 

Sound: 9/10
The music is the primary aesthetic of the anime, and it truly does it justice. 
Majority of the music is classical, which adds to the realism in the anime. The Opening's and Ending songs are great, and fit the nature of the show very well. The soundtrack is another plus, and I found myself listening to many of the OST's quite often. 

Characters: 5/10
By far the weakest aspect of the anime. The main female lead of the anime, Kaori, was horribly written and was a complete plot device. Other characters of the show were weak and didn't receive the necessary screen time and character development required. The only fleshed out and well written character was Arima, but apart from that, I can't mention anyone else.

Enjoyment: 8/10
Shigatsu was an enjoyable anime. It truly was. Even with all of it's flaws and terrible characters, the anime was still a fun watch. The romance, although slight, was still good to see and the relationships between the main characters was heartwarming. The music was superb and I enjoyed every bit of it. The last few episodes of the show was beautifully executed, and definitely provides a tearjerker of an ending. 

Overall 7/10

A fun ride, with a real tearjerker of an ending, but includes various flaws that hindered the experience."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Story (7) : 

The story focuses around Arima Kousei, a 14 year old boy who stopped playing the piano when his mother died..14 years old. This is probably the most unsettling aspect of the show. He is is barely starting his teenage years yet his thoughts and the way he interacts with other characters are extremely mature. I think most monologues in the show were brilliant and greatly helped with character development and I don't think it's fair to discredit an entire show simply because the age of the characters don't really fit with their thinking process but it was annoying. The show focuses a
                  ...
lot on the music and the growth of Arima as a pianist. Personally, I feel like Shigatsu is one of those shows where it is incredibly easy to get involved emotionally in the story because of how the monologues are executed. The premise of the show is very interesting and the execution in itself is always pretty flawless. However, the main reason I gave the story aspect a 7 is the very missed attempt at creating a dramatic setting. I am far from saying the show fails as a drama but I feel like the aspect is not explored correctly before late in the show. It feels like the story was created for dense harem mc's who just can't understand something unless you shove it in their face a billion times. The ending of the show is easily one of my favorites but I don't think every single episode of the serie had to remind us of what was going to happen. I mainly focused on the bad aspects of the story but it's  because it's the weakest point of the anime in my opinion. 

Characters (8) : 

      Giving a rating to the character section was incredibly difficult as I would consider certain characters incredible and others very mediocre, especially considering they are labeled as ""mains"" on here. Let's start with the good ones.

Arima Kousei is the main character of the series and by far the one with the most depth. Throughout the anime, seeing him develop as a pianist and as a person feels incredibly rewarding and he was easily the best part of the show for me. Shigatsu is an anime filled with monologues, almost exclusively from Kousei and while they are not necessary to understand his emotions, they add incredible depth to them and contribute greatly to getting the viewer involved emotionally in the story. This is where I think shigatsu may be hit or miss for most people. I think if you're not able to care for the characters, the flaws of the story and of certain characters will completely take away your enjoyment of the series.

Then, there is Kaori Miyazono, a 14 year old violonist. Throughout the whole series, we get to know more about what she really thinks and how she really feels since it's something she hides a lot and again, it just feels rewarding to watch.

However, Arima and Kaori aren't the only good characters of the series. The other pianists, Emi and Takashi, receive an incredible amount of screentime for side characters. We get to know a lot about their past and see them evolve and their relation with Arima evolve throughout the entire series.

Now, here is where the series messed up character-wise, Tsubaki and Watari. In the first episodes, they are almost constantly with Arima and we get the impression they will have important roles to play in the story but they just... kinda stand there, especially Watari. He is Arima's friend but besides helping him a couple times and playing the goofy lady killer, he is absolutely useless to the story. Tsubaki as a whole receives a bit more depth, but this depth is often just forgotten to keep the main story going. She will often get a lot of screentime one episode and just be forgotten for the three next.

The characters were either incredible or mediocre, which again could lead to a different enjoyment of the series depending on which ones you pay more attention to.

Sound (10) : Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso is not a music anime. The piano performances are here to express the character's emotions and they achieve their goal brilliantly. Every single piece in the anime holds a different meaning and conveys different emotions, The pieces fit in perfectly with the mood and unlike most other piano animes, the piano keys pressed are actually accurate. The openings and endings are also breathtaking.

Art (10) : At first, I found the character design very weird and unsettling. However, this feeling quickly disappeared after a couple of episodes and I was able to fully enjoy how incredible the art truly was. In fact, the art gets better and better as the anime progresses especially once the piano scenes start to increase as it's able to convey emotions without even needing words.

Enjoyment (10) : I can easily recognize the flaws of the series and I can totally understand why some would consider it overrated. I feel like this is probably a hit or miss like most drama animes. Personally, everytime I started an episode, the flaws just disappeared and I was fully enjoying everything. This is why to me, Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso is a masterpiece."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Your Lie in April or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a melodramatic anime adapted from a manga of the same name. The show follows the life of Kousei Arima as he attempts to overcome his trauma and be able to play the piano again. Naturally, Your Lie in April is full of the usual tropes present in schoolkid slice-of-life musical animes, prodigies, romance, and teenage angst galore.

So the entire point of any review is if you should watch the aforementioned show: and my short answer is yes, especially so if you like melodrama. Below is the long answer.

When viewing any new anime a question
                  ...
arises, does Your Lie in April bring something fresh and new to the anime community?

Well the short answer is, no, it doesn't. It follows the same formula that is present in every melodrama of the last decade. In fact, it doesn't even try to hide it, blatantly foreshadowing melodrama every step of the way. But does that mean you shouldn't watch it? By all means no. Although it doesn't bring anything new that doesn't mean that it's not good at doing what it does. To put it in short, Your Lie in April does what a melodrama does best, it acquaints you with the characters and makes you actually care about their lives. 

The story is decently written, although there are few if any plot twists, the story does what it's meant to do, and that is it kept me interested to the very end. Although pacing in the show is sometimes questionable, when some side arcs felt more distracting to the overall story, it was generally alright, though the middle of the series lagged on a bit.

The art was beautifully done in most cases as well, the pastel art style and beautiful landscapes make many frames of this show wallpaper worthy material. However, there are several times when it is obvious the animators skimped with the art.

 The sound was generally good considering much of the soundtrack is comprised of songs written by the classical giants. Beethoven, Saint-Saens, Kreisler, and even Debussy comprise the majority of the show's important scenes. A gripe I had with the sound though was the constant voice overs during the musical performances. An anime about music and the music is replaced by dialogue. Who decided that was a good idea?

Finally, the main problem I had with the show were its characters. I understand that it is hard to build up many complex characters within a 22 episode time frame, but even so some of the characters were so shallowly developed it makes me wonder why they're there in the first place. Also, at many points in the show I felt I was listening to adults going through their midlife crisis instead of middle schoolers. Their views on life and success make this cast the most mature set of 15 year olds I have ever seen. Even so, the characters were generally likable, even if they were not the most dynamic.

Overall the show had a well written story and it had good execution. The characters were the weakness of the anime, but it doesn't take too much away from the overall experience. And I guess the most important part was that I thoroughly enjoyed the ride."

The anime has been raved as one of the best tear-jerker anime. Which I find hard to agree on. The story is about a girl who helped a music prodigy to continue pursuing his music career after a tragic lost which traumatized him enough to stop him from playing. Although she seems like an angel sent by the gods, not many of us are impressed. This was mainly because of the ending; when the secret to her lies revealed but doesn't gives any real impact. 

There was no real

connection between the main protagonist & the female character. They were not childhood friends, nor were they rivals who despised each other. They never shared special memories together. They were nothing. The backstory doesn't help set the mood. I feel nothing. It felt like it was made to fish for viewers sympathy for the female character who had terrible misfortune. I feel sorry for her. But not Sad. How can anyone feels anything about someone they have zero connection? The backstory really feels empty and one-sided. I find the female character  unattractive. Yes she is beautiful, yes she is good with her instrument. But as a character, not so much. She was a stalker! She imposed her ideas on the guy. Sly her way into his group of friends. Using the best friend to get close. The protagonist may fall for her from her beauty, her determination, her caring, her being his best duet.. but I really felt nothing. The 'Lie' really fail to bring me to tears. I was left with a big empty hole in my heart. dissatisfied."

Knowing even a little about classical performances completely killed my enjoyment of this anime. Here's a few reasons why.

1. No actual differences in the music. The writers keep saying a certain performance is good, or another is terrible, but even with all my training I can barely hear any of this supposed nuance. This is terrible sound design - there is a LOT you can do to make music sound different or bad. 

2. Talking over the music. This makes point 1
                  ...
even harder - judging music is difficult enough with zero background noise. It's considered very disrespectful to be talking in a concert, as it takes away the enjoyment of other listeners. There were so many points where I just wanted everyone to shut up and let the music do the talking. There's plenty of time before and after the performance which could have been used to explain the story, instead of drudging through shitty chibi comedy.

3. Skill level of the performers. I'm acquainted with one of Australia's best pianists. At the age of 18, he would have struggled with many of the pieces shown in this anime. The kids here are 12. Sure, it's explained that the characters are very motivated and have great teachers, but it's almost impossible for 12-year-olds to have that much technical and emotional prowess. There simply isn't enough time for their hands and brains to develop.

As for the rest of the anime, the pacing crawls along at a snail's pace, most of the characters motivations aren't relatable, and the comedy is completely out of place. A wholly unenjoyable experience that I don't recommend."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"A common trend that I see around me is that many people seem to regard any show that is emotional and tear jerking ""beautiful"" or a ""masterpiece"". These people get so caught up in their ""feels"" that they seem to disregard all the problems that a show might have. 

The proof? Your Lie in April

Your Lie in April follows Arima Kousei. A former piano prodigy who swept the competition through his flawless performances when he was a child. But when his mother dies he suffers a mental breakdown and becomes unable to hear the sound of the piano even though his hearing is completely fine.
                  ...
After that Kousei gives up the piano and lives a carefree life with his friends for two years. Now he views the world in monotone, devoid of any color. His usual life continues until one day a chance encounter in April turns his melancholic lifestyle around and changes his life forever.

The first half is pretty lighthearted for the most part. The colorful animation, unique characters and slapstick comedy really give off the feeling that it's a romantic comedy. It's only when you delve deeper into the show that you realize this isn't the case. In the second half the show becomes much darker and this is what brings me to my problem, the melodrama. For me I don't hate melodrama that much. It is an effective way of evoking emotions from the viewer, but the problem that I have with Your Lie in April is that apparently the producers thought it was a good idea to put in a dull joke in almost every sad or dramatic scene. It feels like the makers of the show thought that the melodrama would be too much for the viewers, so they decided to slide in a crappy joke to lighten up the mood. This just ruined many emotional parts of the show for me and it was pretty annoying.

 One of the biggest criticisms I see with this show and agree with is the excessive use of monologues. The show has a lot of monologues, and when I mean a lot I mean every episode. Now although I personally like monologues in literature and animation Your Lie in April uses monologues so much that in many cases it becomes redundant. Is it so much to ask that you don't treat the viewers like we have no idea what the characters are feeling?

As a character driven show. You would expect a lot of depth in the characters right? Well yes and no. One thing that I really commend Your Lie in April for is Kousei's development. His growth from a depressed and melancholic kid to a person who stands up to the face of tragedy and moves on is truly rewarding. But don't expect this amount of development for the other characters. Watari gets little to no development over the course of the show. He is pretty much just a side character filling in the role of friend A (pretty ironic, isn't it?) Watari's lack of development doesn't bother me that much, but Kaori's lack of development does. In the start of the show. Kaori is shown as probably one of the most important main characters that helps Kousei get over his past trauma and help him play again. But in the second half of the show she feels like a side character whose only purpose is to move the story forward, and she only gets the development she deserves in the final episodes. This was truly disappointing for me because her character had so much potential to be great. There was one character that Your Lie In April didn't neglect though, and that's Sawabe Tsubaki. (Kousei's childhood friend) Tsubaki's constant struggle with caring for Kousei while denying her feelings for him was nice and it was very interesting to see grow through the internal struggles of her feelings.

The animation in Your Lie in April is pretty impressive. The vibrant colors and beautiful backgrounds really bring the show to life. Characters are animated with more detail than usual which might turn some people off, but I found it to make the show that much better. One thing that I really liked from Your Lie In April is the visual effects that are implemented in the emotional parts. There were definitely some effects that really intensified the whole mood, and it was absolutely beautiful. There are parts where the animation took a small dip,(Still shots, lazy animation) but all in all the animation was just stunning and I wouldn't want the show to look any other way.

Now for a show like this you would expect the music to be an integral part of this show, and Your Lie in April doesn't disappoint. The soundtrack is top notch and fits into every scene flawlessly. The musical performances were also nothing short of stunning. The first opening ""Hikaru Nara"" is a great opening that fits the lighthearted tone of the first half, while the second opening ""Nanairo symphony"" didn't seem to fit in the second half as well I had hoped but it was still a great opening nonetheless. The first ending ""Kirameki"" is a really nice song with a laid back tone while the second ending ""Orange"" has a bit more sorrowful tone to it which fit the atmosphere of the show perfectly.

I'll be honest here. I would be lying if I said I didn't like this show. I was the person that would watch the newest episode right when it came out. And in the end I guess its the reason that I really like this show that I can point out its mistakes, and take out the time to actually write a review for it. If you truly loved someone would you ignore his/her flaws and treat them as a perfect person? Of course you wouldn't. From personal enjoyment I loved Your Lie in April. I  loved Kousei's performances and watching Kaori's energetic personality always brought a smile to my face, but nevertheless just because I love a show doesn't mean I ignore all the flaws with it."

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,RecommendedSpoiler,"This was without a doubt one of the most beautiful shows I´ve ever seen.

I´m not the reviewing-type of person so this will be more my thoughts on this show.

First I have to say that this series was from the visual and acoustical point brilliant. There is nothing as annoying as bad CGI ruining the mood of a scene, just because you´re so distracted that you can´t concentrate on the dialogue. Just recently I had a few shows I really liked, also from the animation point of view, but when it came to CGI they were quite a mess from time to time (like the background
                  ...
people from parasyte). In this case it is the opposite. The merging from 3d to 2d was amazing and I enjoyed the animation of the fingers and keyboards really much. But the animation wasn´t the only visual aspect I loved. “Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso” always knew when to be bright and colourful, or when to be more dusty and dark. It had a unique art style that may not be for everyone but I personally liked very much.
Same goes for the music.

This is a music-anime so this is an important point. When you really dislike classical music, or when you can´t stand a whole episode just watching somebody playing piano, than this is definitely not the right show for you. But If you like it or even just don´t bother than you should give it a try. Personally I´ve never been so much into classical music, but I think in combination with movies or series it is a great instrument of support. Here we get characters who try to reach the emotions of their audience through the music. Hence they literally are what they are playing, because their souls became part of the music. So if you don´t like the music you obviously won´t get emotionally attached to this.

That leads us to the characters ...that´s a hard question. I´m not so much into romance as a genre because I´m not good at watching two people who actually love each other not getting together...it nearly physically hurts me. Considering this there is not so much character development. When you get to know a character ...you really know him. There aren´t many twists or changes in them or their actions, but that is neither a flaw nor is something missing through this in my opinion, because I personally liked the characters as they were. They felt natural and that is something I don´t say very often in anime.

I haven´t mentioned the plot yet, but there is not so much to mention without major spoilers...so we get our bunch of high school kids, who are really close friends, but with different goals for the future and our protagonist is a pianist, who quit playing a while ago...so guess what will happen....But that was also not a flaw in my opinion because in this anime the how counts much more than the what.

All in all this was absolutely beautiful. It gave me chills from the first to the last second and is absolutely worth a try (if you don´t have a problem with romance, drama and classical music)."

     There is undeniably great animes with the theme of music and romance. But one that stands out for its art, story, and music is undoubtedly Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Filled with beautiful art, music and characters, each episode makes you instantly want to watch the next. This is one series that kept me fascinated from start to end.

     Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso may seem like any other music anime; A talented musician participating in competitions and overcoming obstacles with others
                  ...
and growing as a musician, but it is so much more. 

     The story begins with our protagonist Arima Kousei, a fourteen year old prodigy at the piano. Having being prodded to practice piano for most of his childhood, the sole reason for his devotion was not to the piano itself, but for the happiness of his mother. After his mother passed away his world lost its color, having lost what made him who he was, his standalone quality. He lives out his middle school days, without any direction. However this all changes when he meets Miyazono Kaori, a beautiful violinist that brings the color back into his world. 

     Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a wonderful representation of a musicians view of the world. Filled with competitions and the inevitable failure, but also the taste of success. This show does well in various aspects and is a great show to watch. The drama builds up each episode, the soundtrack leaves you with goosebumps, and the characters make you want to cheer them on.
	This story follows the lives of two extremely talented musicians. Both have their own difficulties, but at the same time manage to push each other forward.

     The world of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is wonderfully drawn. The art and used throughout the series was stunning. The backgrounds as well as the characters were well designed with a focus on every detail. For an anime made in 2014 this quality definitely stands out for its unique art, attention to details and its own style of characters. 
     As the title suggest Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Your Lie in April; this anime takes place around spring. With sakura petals dancing through the air as well as the overall atmosphere in which the anime takes place in really embodies the artwork. Just by watching a single episode one can tell a lot of time was spent on every detail. 

     As for the character designs, they were all well done. Each was particularly well drawn and represented their personality and style perfectly. What was even more impressive was that every detail was well articulated, showing every motion when playing their instruments, every pull of the bow and tap of the key, really makes you feel the passion and everything they put into their style of playing. The CGI used was not overbearing in fact it was nicely integrated into parts of the anime. The amount of time and effort A-1 studios put in really shines through.

     However time and effort was not just spent on art, the music played was also an amazing addition to the anime; as it is to any music anime genre. But the music particularly stands out due to its special renditions of classics. Playing even music from iconic composers like Mozarts Moonlight Sonata or Chopin’s Etudes. Even if you’re not interested in classical music the pieces are definitely interesting due to its unique flare and renditions that the characters add on. The pieces chosen were definitely a worthy addition to the anime.

     The soundtrack is also an amazing fit to this anime. The background music played throughout the series can be described as light but overall fitting with the mood and ambiance of the story. The music though not greatly noticeable definitely helps portray the emotions that the characters are feeling. Overall the music and sound presented in this series was wonderful and people who decide to watch this anime should definitely pay attention to it.

     The characters presented in this anime are both unique and interesting, each with their own backstories and unique quirks. There is Arima Kousei who is a talented pianist and Kaori Miyazono a unique violinist.  Both these characters were well designed as have completely different personalities. Because of this, the interactions with each other throughout the story becomes an interesting aspect to watch, both of them supporting each other and pushing each other forward. Not only are their characters interesting but they are also well developed, the progression of each character is nicely paced as viewers we can clearly see the motivation of each of their actions. Each episode is intriguing and builds up the next episode.

    Overall Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a wonderful anime with quality story and animation. Those who also enjoy music with a bit of drama mixed in should definitely give this anime a try."

Men are fucking worthless. In the situation that you see one, or are somehow friends with one, you should, in any situation, be violent towards them. Good examples of violent acts viable are throwing heavy objects at them, hitting them with musical instruments or simply punching them. Also keep in mind that men are creatures that are incapable of making a
                  ...
decision on their own. You should decide their future, even if the decisions they've made are to avoid the effects of PTSD. You see, they are incapable of rational or individual thought, so, if they choose not to do something, and you think they should do it, force them for their own good, especially when it directly benefits you, since you don't want to be pulled down by the decisions of a M.A.L.E. In the situation that these males don't abide by your will, keep hitting and harassing them with your request until they do. Don't accept rejection on any level. As a last ditch attempt, you have one last ultimate weapon. Crying. These species are so honestly pathetic around crying women, even when they can clearly see it is fake, that they will give up, and do whatever you ask of them. But maybe you are a kind person at heart and you'd never hurt or want to manipulate these animals. But trust me, it's okay. Because if you'll ask them ""Do you resent me?"" they will only answer that you make them better. 

While dropping the exaggerated meninist attitude, this is how the life of Kousei Arima is. He is treat exactly this way by his friends and love interest(s). I can understand some degree of slapstick, designed to make the show more lighthearted and humorous. Sure, I am not a big fan of slapstick, but I witnessed it enough to understand what it means. However, in Kousei Arima's situation, it is entirely overdone. You see, this character, has PTSD, due to the abuse his mother put him through as a child. His mother was crippled by a disease and was unable to play on the piano due to it. The mother forced him to practice the piano continuously days and days on end while hitting him each time he made a mistake, and convinced him that if he wins the competitions, she will get better. Not only did the kid blame himself for any mistake he made, but his mother, the person he wanted to help, hit and abused him at every step of the way. And he was loyal to her to the point anyone who was badmouthing her, he would think to himself ""I am the only person who is on my mother's side."" Then his mother dies and due to the trauma, he was left unable to use the piano because he couldn't hear what he was playing on the piano as an aftereffect of the trauma. The anime's goal is for this character to rediscover his love for music. But instead what I see is how a 14 year old boy gets taken advantage of in this anime. Taken advantage of how?

To fill you in, as every relationship screaming quality storytelling, this starts by him taking an accidental photograph of his love interest while her dress is lifted up by the wind, revealing her crotch. She acts out violenty towards him. Then they get introduced to each other by their friends because they were supposed to meet in order to introduce this friend of hers to this girl so they can go on a date. The date consists of her playing at a violin contest. They listen to her and there the 14 year old forms the impression of, and I quote ""She's ultraviolent, her personality blows and she leaves the worst impression, but she's beautiful"". They eventually leave, but they meet again, where she angrily tells him to play a song on the piano in front of some children because otherwise she'd look bad. Then eventually they have a heart to heart and he tells her about the fact he can't hear the notes, but that doesn't affect his day to day life. Then she starts kicking him and tell him that he should play regardless because that's how people like them survive. Afterwards she decides that she wants him to play as her accompaniament at her next concert and has his group of friends bombard him with requests, music sheets and the song she wants him to play for an entire week. He dodges this harassment as much as he can until in the last 30 minutes until the competition. Then she cries in front of him and that convinces him to say yes.

Now let me change my example to something much more extreme and over the top, with which I hope will get my point across.

To fill you in, as every relationship screaming quality storytelling, this starts by him accidentally parking in an illegal space due to a flat tire, and her giving him a ticket because she works law enforcement. She acts out violenty towards him. Then they get introduced to each other by their friends with one of them having a date with her. The date consists of her going to a shooting range and shooting, I don't know, bottles. They watch her and there the war veteran forms the impression of, and I quote ""She's ultraviolent, her personality blows and she leaves the worst impression, but she's beautiful"". They eventually leave, but they meet again, where she angrily tells him to shoot a gun in front of some children because otherwise she'd look bad, somehow. Then eventually they have a heart to heart and he tells her about the fact he has flashbacks of his buddies dying every time he sees a gun. Then she starts kicking him and tell him that he should use a gun regardless because that's how people like them survive. Afterwards she decides that she wants him to accompany her to a nearby war zone but he refuses. She harasses him alongside his friends by placing guns at his work and playing the country's anthem. He dodges this harassment as much as he can until in the last 30 minutes until the troups assemble. Then she cries in front of him and that convinces him to say yes.

Again, an extreme parallel, but I need you to understand that any case of PTSD is serious, especially to the person that has been through the trauma. You don't get over your issues just because requests you to and you would avoid the triggers as much as possible because that could make you relieve the trauma and have flashbacks. The writing of the show pretty much makes Arima be bullied out of his depression and be forced to play for the laughs of others. And I simply find that stupid and unrealistic. You can't expect someone to get bullied out of their depression on the sheer fact that they got a crush. You can't simply expect that a character you've written as suffering of PTSD due to child abuse to simply do the activities other people want him to, when they abuse him in order to get him to do it. I am a generally insensitive person, but this is a subject that you do not delve in without understanding how such a person would behave. I am sure that someone that was traumatized by war would avoid fighting in another war. I am sure that a rape victim would have a hard time seeking romantic partners, if not simply avoid them entirely. And I am also sure that someone that has been abused as a child would seek to avoid the means because of which they were abused for. But one thing I am sure of is this. You will never be able to force these people into doing the cause of the trauma ever.

I wish I could've mocked it instead for the fact that it spouted cringy lines like ""my spring came and she made my world colorful. why is the sky so starry tonight"". I wish that I could've mocked it for having all the characters fall in love with each other just because they had screentime. I wish that I could've mocked the series for every other character being simply selfish pricks. But the way this character has been portrayed simply undermine any other complaints I might make because it simply ruined any sort of credibility I could've seen in the series. I cannot be entertained by a relationship that I would believe would never realistically act out this way, and much less by the fact that Arima is just expected to overcome this with no individuality and because his friends want him to. If the week would've been spent with the characters having a talk with him, telling him that he shouldn't give up on his hobby, as he seems to be still quite attached to it after some time, or bring any other arguments to him or at least try to reason with him, I could deem this at least acceptable. But nobody cares about what Arima thinks. Including Arima's boner for the blonde. Nobody tries to understand and be accepting of him. They just want him to do stuff.

The only thing I truly appreciated about this series is the production values. I've enjoyed the classical music even if I occasionally listen to classical music, but I appreciate it every time. And I also appreciated the detail put in the animation, like the realistic way the hands reflect onto the piano as just one example. It is dissapointing to me that this is wasted on Shigatsu, who equates hitting people as displays of affection as well as an endearing trait, which to be fair, is something common in anime. It is dissapointing to me that it is wasted on something that displays that someone's psychological issues are as just them being fussy and difficult about it. But the fact that is most dissapointing that the main character will be thankful for it, and think that his lifestyle is improved by going through this again. I wholeheartedly agree that if depressed, it is very important to do things that you don't want to do or normally wouldn't do. I also think that friend should be supportive of you and make sure that you are still active in your life. But forcing you to simply do something due to which you got traumatized, is neither support or a way to tackle depression. It's anguish and torture for the person forced to do so. I can't buy into this character acting the way he does, simply because I understand that trauma doesn't work this way.

The only way I can recommend Shigatsu is if you're easily influenced emotionally and/or impressionable, and are looking for a romance story with good production values. Shigatsu is that. It definitely has atmosphere and metaphors for the romantics out there, and as far as I know, these type of series depend on how you feel about them, rather than what you'd think. I am a more rational person, and I simply can't enjoy things I don't understand, and all of the previous paragraphs explain why I don't understand the way the story goes forward. And if I can't understand how he could see his romantic interest as his romantic interest, besides being 14 and horny, I can't appreciate this series."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"The reason why I gave this anime a 3 is not because it’s bad, but rather because I wasn’t able to enjoy it at all. 

Let’s state the good points first, the art is beautiful. The music is good too, even though there are too many « interruptions » (dialogues, inner thoughts, public reactions, etc) during the performances, which can’t let you enjoy genuinely the classical music.

Then, regarding the actual contents of the show : almost all the characters pissed me off, starting by the main one. It’s fiction, so let’s suppose a psychological disorder such as Arata’s is possible ; but he is whiny, indecisive, and
                  ...
annoying. Even thought his premise, while cliché, is not the worst and makes you want to root for him (« I’m a nice and talented guy but I’m still traumatized about something that happened years ago, and it explains why I’m absolutely not self-confident neither about music nor about the girl I like »), he’s too passive, and the way he acts towards himself and others often frustrated of disappointed me.
About the main girl, I can understand that she looks perfect because she is depicted from Arata’s point of view ; but I didn’t feel empathy towards her at all. Her behavior (I won’t spoil, but she made some important decisions revealed at the end) is well justified, but it feels too « fictionesque », too idealized. It’s not sufficient for her to look perfect from Arata’s point of view, she is also made to look perfect to the spectator. 

These « bad » traits wouldn’t feel so awful if they were the only problem ; after all, the characters have some consistency. But all of it is intensified by the atmosphere of the show : the pace is sluggish, and everything is made to look over-dramatic. While the beginning looks light-hearted, it quickly deviates from this path. Most of the show is made of monologues, inner thoughts, and commentaries, which is really unbearable sometimes. At some point, even a simple discussion between the two protagonists can’t be « normal » anymore, and the « childhood memories » are just too much. What is more, because of this atmosphere, I wasn't receptive at all to the comedy.  

Then, the ending … I guess it’s the reason why it got such a high score on MAL. Yes, it’s a beautiful and sad ending, but it’s far from enough to make up for the rest of the show. 

Of course, it’s subjective, but the story, characters, pacing and atmosphere really suffer from the comparison to Nodame Cantabile. They have a similar premise (trauma of the main character, meeting with a peculiar girl in the first episode), but Your Lie in April is just too childish, really bad-paced, and wasted its potential ; besides, the musical dimension is just too different. While Nodame is centered about music, and actually teaches you a lot about classical, YLIA simply ""uses"" it : the characters and their relationships actually take the whole place, while music is more of a tool for their evolution and the advance of the story. 

I admit 3 is harsh (and normally, I would have given it a 5), but this score also takes into account my disappointment. I enjoy good romances, bildungsroman, and I love classical music, so I had great expectations for this show since I only saw praise about it ; but sadly I had to force myself to watch through the end."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Spoilder-free review: I really wanted to give Your Lie in April a 10/10, I truly did. A lot of the times with high quality anime I try to work backwards and rationalize a 10, but I found that I just couldn't overlook the flaws in this show, and in particular the following 3 things were the deal breakers for me:

THE BAD:

1. I didn't enjoy the music - and it's not because I'm not a classical fan - I""m a piano player myself and I still didn't enjoy the music. For an anime centered around music, that is unacceptable in my opinion. I'm always looking at
                  ...
Sakamichi no Apollon as the standard for this one because the music was memorable, catchy and instantly recognizable as the series approached its end. Unfortunately, that was not the case with Your Lie in April as I found myself forgetting the piano pieces played in the series. The reason for this was because half the time I couldn't completely hear the performance. There was too much inner monologue that would disrupt the music, and often the monologue dragged on far too long when a simple epiphany was needed. The side characters were also too eager to comment on the side and interrupted the piano. For a show that speaks about how a pianist should let their emotions be conveyed by their playing, it doesn't follow through. I wish that it would commit to the music and let it runs it course, then follow with exposition or vice versa. It simply didn't let one of it's greatest assets as an anime about music shine.

2. I never cried and was never close to it. In fact I didn't even feel sad. The show doesn't seem to know how to dispel dramatic and tense moments other than with ill-timed ""comedic"" moments. I put comedic in quotations because that was their intent but it never came off properly. I felt that whenever a dramatic scene between two characters unfolded, the show was unwilling to have those characters engage in meaningful heart-to-heart talk that is so central to slice of life shows. It was as if it was afraid of getting serious and this was truly a missed opportunity because those are the moments where you can truly witness some character development. And its exactly this problem that causes Your Lie in April to fumble with its big, cry-inducing moments because it dispels all of the atmosphere it creates with this treatment. I'm comparing this aspect with Anohana which never avoided these sorts of situations by dodging with comedy. 

3. There wasn't enough closure. I feel like I can't discuss this point without spoiling anything, so I will leave it at that.

THE GOOD

1. Openings and Endings: MY GAAAAAAAAAAAAWD THESE WERE AMAZING. Loved all four of 'em, especially ED 2.

2. Art & Animation: I liked the theme of colour - how A1 Productions portrays colour entering and leaving Kousei's world is just a treat and Your Lie in April is one of the most animated shows I've seen.

OVERALL

I know I wrote extensively about the bad but little about the good, but I truly enjoyed the show a lot, I'm just focusing on why I can't give it a 10/10. Taking this all into consideration I'm giving it a solid 8."

Music is freedom.Music is what makes life more colorful,more livelier and more meaningful.Emotions hidden within every notes is conveyed through music.Its reach is infinite.It can also heal one's wounded heart.Such is the power of music.Not that it

matters.This show is like a cheesecake with too much cheese.It's good already.Sadly, so much cheese ruined it.The animations are awesome,very consistent,so colorful and fluid.It's an eye candy.The sounds are great,or even perfect.I can live with this music in my ears forever.Characters are cute.What else? The story,I can't say anything about it because this show is fueled not by the plot but by the characters.And then I look deeper to it, delve in to its insides.After going out, I have to say that this show could be better if only the director was different.Most scenes were damn too cheesy.I love dramas but not this kind of drama.I understand that most drama shows always have cheesiness but some make up for it by lessening it or adding something to balance it.Man,most scenes are too unnatural or should I say forced that it made my hair raise.I was about to quit already but then, the performances came and it was like I was watching a different show.The performances were too fantastic and moving.I was impressed.Everything flowed smoothly during those plays and the next time I knew it, it's over already.Seriously,the performances should have been better with just music and no dialogues.The music and the scenes transitioning during the concerts were enough for me to understand what the characters are trying to convey.Most characters are likeable and quite realistic but the way they act feels unnatural.It's like the characters were told to act shamelessly but they didn't want to do it so Director-kun forced them to just do it or you get no pay and this was what happened --- ""super duper ""junior"" school cheesiness"".But exception,again, is during the performances.The characters during their plays were fantastic.It's like they became different people.They were natural and I feel connected to them.And then,after the play,they go cheesy again.Humor is also cheesy.Actually,everything in this show are cheesy except,again, the performances.This show,I expected too much and hoped too much,but expectations = shattered.My conclusion is well,obviously because of the cheesiness.I hate cheese.This show is not really bad.In fact, it's good and could have been made better if only the characters were more natural,touch-feely scenes made less cheesier,and more violin performance of Kaori(the last one is just me being selfish).Bottom line? The director tried too hard making a drama show but was just not cut out for that kind of genre.He should just make a show about cheese. 


The fourth season is just superfluous to the Nodame Cantabile franchise.It shouldn't have been made.Just kidding.I'm glad this show has been made.And of course, it's title is really Your lie in April.lol.I actually personally liked this show.In fact, I love it.But I'm mentally retarded so I aspire to become a scientist that conquers the world with her madness and then, I'll sleep.

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"TL;DR: If you're considering watching this, I implore you not to believe the hype, and save yourself the frustration of watching this show. It really is terrible.

This show is the true embodiment of a tragedy, and not because this show is sad. The work itself is tragically bad. This show really threw me for a loop. Initially, while appalled by the character art (particularly the lips and eyes), I was still vaguely enthralled. The atmosphere in the beginning made the show seem full of potential. However, it quickly devolved into a mockery of a serious anime.

The main character was basically what it would look like
                  ...
if Shinji from Evangelion was a piano prodigy. He was indecisive, whiny, and uninteresting. I understand the effect the writers were going for with the psychological element of child abuse and loss, but it became an obnoxiously repetitive theme, that never went away. It even got tossed in at random points after he had seemingly put those demons to rest. 

The main heroine was also an annoying character. Many of her actions did not make any sense, and she was often just generally obnoxious. The ending particularly bothered me, but that's a spoiler, and it's plain to see once one has seen this travesty. It was really the other girl in the love-triangle who was the one I found myself rooting for. Yet she showed no backbone, and did a lot of things that just didn't make sense.

The most interesting characters were Tsubaki, her friend (who came in mid-way through the story with no introduction whatsoever, no back story and no development. She ended up saying something really poignant at the end, and ruined it with a really inappropriate and poorly timed joke, as the mood did not warrant such a joke), Seto, and Koharu (she was genuinely funny and adorable even though she didn't contribute to the story at all).

My biggest issue overall with this show stems from the fact that it tries desperately to be deep and meaningful, but it ends up coming out as forced and unnatural. Every episode was littered with internal monologues where the characters thought deeply to themselves. However, I find it hard to believe that all of these characters, many of them 15 or younger, were thinking this deeply for such a significant amount of time. Even if I were to give them a pass on that, the use of this device lost its meaning quickly. When characters are having at least one epiphany an episode, it loses its emotional power. There's a fine line between having characters with awareness, and feeling unnatural. This felt unnatural. Characters and the audience need to be led towards the final climax: a real epiphany where the characters learn a lesson. But here, it was crammed down our throats every episode. By the time I reached the end, every one of these internal monologues made me upset and angry. There were so many literary, auditory, and visual devices used, but they were used in excess. In this situation less is more, because it can accentuate the truly important parts, instead of creating confusion about what's important and what's not.

Also, the way the characters' realizations were spoon-fed to the audience makes me think either the writers are stupid, the writers think the audience is stupid, or both.

The one redeeming quality of this show was the music. It was really good. I loved OP 1, didn't care much for ED 1, but I liked OP and ED 2 pretty well. Also Koharu was always there making a funny face to make me laugh. I needed those laughs to keep from tearing my hair out.

With that said, this show ranks number three on my all-time worst anime, right above Oregairu S2 and Guilty Crown. If you're considering watching this, I implore you not to believe the hype, and save yourself the frustration of watching this show. It really is terrible."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"A captivating vignette of that critical threshold between adolescence and adulthood, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso masterfully captures the sheer sentimentality of one of the most formative periods of our lives, and does so with an astonishing sensitivity to the truly granular nuances which color human emotion and experience. 

While the work itself might be most readily categorized as a ""coming-of-age"" tale, it doubly operates as a thoroughly cathartic emotional surrogate  for those of us who have been fortunate enough to not yet have dealt with loss in our lives, as well as a penetrating inquiry into the notion of loss in general: what
                  ...
are the various ways in which we can lose? can we recover that which has been lost, and how do we cope with loss?

As you will see in the series throughout, loss encompasses not only life, but feelings and perceptions about others, interests and passion in things, and also abides in the dynamic between victor and loser with respect to acknowledgement, affection, and adoration. In refrain, the series expertly explores the ways in which we tend to rationalize and respond to loss, whether it be through resignation, listlessness, anger, reprisal, or despair.

Of course, the work as a whole is a visual and aural delight, and employs these elements as not merely representational niceties to the narrative, but as singularly evocative components which can just as easily stand on their own merits as they can come together to enhance the sum presentation into something truly spectacular. On the artwork, the series elegantly employs an alternating color palette and variable visual style to reflect character interiority: scenes of despondency are depicted with dull and overcast tones; those of bliss tend towards vibrant hues or impressionistic representation with soft and dream-like pastels; and, at the very end, moments of absolute understanding, clarity, and repose as expressed through lucid tones, diaphanous outlines, infinitely reflective surfaces and pristine planes. While I can't speak as authoritatively to the music, the choice of pieces seemed fantastically appropriate; the Saint-Saens was delightfully playful, while each of the Chopin compositions were sufficiently stylistically variegated to accurately reflect the depth of emotions informing the performances themselves, ranging from tender and plaintive sustained notes to dizzying and tempestuous cadenzas.

While many question the appositeness of broad, soul-searching, introspective monologues from adolescents, some rather histrionic narrative devices, and the frequent fragmentation of visual and affective continuity with stylistically divergent humor scenes, it has been a wonderful opportunity to view what I believe has been one of the most poignant and cohesive endeavors at relating the totality of emotion which underlies those chance associations which color our experience: those necessarily fleeting moments which imbue us with sadness and strength, and the unanticipated and abrupt way in which these special encounters make us more whole in wholly unexpected ways."

It is very interesting to see how Arima combats against his mentality(fear).The story is very life like(a perfect example of a slice of life anime).A very realistic show.

Art-9/10
The art blends in  very perfect for the show.The show is very colorful, Its always a pleasure to see very episode.

Every character seemed distinct from the other.This is a sign of good character design and how realistic the show is.The character design is so realistic that it feels as if the story is true.

Silent features of the show-The use of very high quality literature during few lines of some characters.The way the story unfolds is amazing,the timing for every event is perfect.

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Your lie in April is one of those sappy Anime I thought I could just pass up. Not pay any mind to and go on to the next ""flavor of the month"". But after the first episode, it had been a while since an Anime had gotten me hooked. And honestly, i'm so glad that it did. For one thing, the Anime does take a dip on the second half of the show, and does start to stray away from what I (and i think you) would like about it in the beginning. But do not mistake this as a a good show gone bad,
                  ...
because it is a good show that just slumps, then ends on a bang. If that isn't enough reassurance, than take a look at a few snaps of art from the show (which is one of the best animated shows I have ever seen) and the great music to accompany it is really good. The characters for me are what you may expect from a Anime like Your lie in April, a underwhelming male character that falls for a attractive girl and becomes more confident and happy as the show continues, but in actuality, it isn't so much the case in this one. Sure our main character Kosei may seem that way at first, but then a subtle twist that keeps this show rolling through all 22 episodes is that he is a massively important young piano prodigy, who went missing for 2 years after an incredible reign among-st his young and talented rivals due to a tragic occurrence. Of course I won't mention what it was or how it occurred, but you have to watch until the end of the Anime, because this event foreshadows a-lot, which I highly respect. If you are wondering at this point whether or not you really want to watch another love story esc Anime, make it this one. It truly is a good one, and though I have a few minor gripes with the show (odd side stories and weird character arks to name a few) the show is good enough to justify watching in one or two sittings like I did. Not to mention, you may have another great opening song to get stuck in your head like I did after watching the first half of the show. Add it to your list, you will love Your lie in April."

Of all the feels you can feel this anime will make you experience the happiest and the saddest of them. A piano prodigy who has lost his way meets a wildly mysterious violinist who plays with no holds barred.

STORY:
This is a great story about love, music, and tragedy. This story will make your heart soar one moment and then sink in the next. Because this is a spoiler free review I cannot go into details but I believe it will suffice to say that the story alone is a reason to
                  ...
watch this anime it is well paced and even in the slowest moments it is not boring.

ART:
The vibrant colors and softly drawn characters are up to par or above most anime. This show is just beautiful and dose not leave any room for wanting in the visuals department. The animation does not look cheap or as if they needed to pinch pennies it is top notch.

SOUND:
If you like classical music you will love this show, I myself am not a huge fan but this show gave me new respect for the genre and actually had me looking up and listening to the songs from the show. Although I'm still not a major fan but it worked really well in this anime and I want to see more like this one.

CHARACTERS:
The world in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is not very dynamic there are no moving parts to the world to drive the plot thus the characters are the vehicle and driving force for the anime. So this anime sinks or swims on how good the characters are... and they deliver. These characters are not based on archetypes like in a lot of anime, although the tsundere childhood friend does happen to be in this anime, but she is not unbearable and she does have character development and backstory that really help out making her likable. The other characters are fairly fresh and original feeling and that is a major plus in my book.

ENJOYMENT:
I really liked this anime, not favorite of all time but it has a good story and very little to complain about, it's the kind of show that if watched weekly will leave you wanting more and if marathoned makes you go without sleep. And when you finish will really leave you with a heavy heart and a lump in the throat.

OVERALL:
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a great anime not just watch it once and never again great but buy it and watch it over and over great, though you probably will be pretty emotional while watching it."

                                      (6/22 eps)","First of all, let just say that I stopped watching this around episode 6, so my scores and final score are my judgement based on only those. 

tl;dr: I know I'm missing out. I just can't watch anymore. The show is probably very good later on, but I shouldn't have to slog through the terrible characterization of the first 10 episodes to get to that point.

Second, I am well aware of how generally well liked this show is, and how high scores it usually receives. I can see why, if I squint. The art is amazing, the music is on-point, and the show has several
                  ...
factors going for it, like dealing with themes of motivation, goals, child abuse, and more.

This wasn't enough, not by a long shot. The hints of actual plot were there, and I probably missed their culmination by stopping so early, but I just wasn't in a mood to slog through something I didn't enjoy.

That is to say, I enjoyed it at first. The first two, three episodes were kinda fun, but then I kept expecting the characters to grow a bit, for something at all to change their circumstances after they got to know each other, but nothing of the sort happened, to the point where I couldn't watch anymore.

And I really wanted to like this. I did. I was really interested in the music tag and setting. The premise was very interesting, a retired master pianist with issues is forced to resurface by a violinist girl, etc etc.

I'm not even gonna touch the dramatics or the pacing. Those have already been beaten to death by others, Instead, I'll talk about the characters.

The problem, to me, was the characters. I couldn't get behind them at all. The two main characters, at least. Out of a grand total of four that appeared by episode six. Kosei, Watari, Tsubaki and Kaori. Watari was okay when he showed up, which wasn't often.
Tsubaki was my favorite in this show, but not because she was amazing or anything. She was good, but the others were just worse.

 Kosei is the typical doormat protagonist, who doesn't know anything, has almost zero backbone (unless he's been worked over by his 'friends'), accomplishes nothing by himself, and constantly needs the support of others in order to stand. None of his supposed friends respect him, but I can't blame then, because I couldn't respect him at all either, and I really wanted to, because I liked the idea of him. 

Kaori, on the other hand, is is about 80% of the reason I had to stop watching. She's the most classic of classic examples of Mary-Sue. Incredibly skilled, amazingly beautiful, always (ALWAYS) right, has a somewhat mysterious/interesting(supposedly) backstory, everybody likes her and when she speaks everyone is hanging on her every word, even if she waxes poetic about stuff that rarely make sense or is getting repeated for the third time. Her dragging Kosei by the nose got old very, very fast, I saw no sign of this stopping by episode six, and I was thoroughly sick of it.

I don't know. Maybe I can pick it up again when I'm in a more tolerant mood. For now, I think a 6/10 overall is more than generous enough."

Art + Sound 10/10: The best part of this anime, the sounds were gorgeous, and the character art was consistent and good. The last episode, especially, had some amazing art and sound. The music played was pretty amazing (where did they get those recordings?).

Story + Character 6/10: Very slow paced, very predictable character reactions, very slow character development, tolerable plot, and pretty satisfying ending. Also, being a pianist, I can assure you that concert halls aren't nearly that rowdy (at least where I live). That about sums it up."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"I started this anime by telling myself ""I'm not going to cry.""

Surprise, I cried. 

I basically knew nothing going into this series, only knowing that it focused on music and was suppose to be very sad. There aren't very many ""plot twists"" that you can't really predict ahead of time, so I didn't find it a very unpredictable series, but the story is very enjoyable. [Well, as enjoyable as one that makes you cry can be I guess.] Overall I found it to be very real and very believable that this could happen. I suppose my one complaint would be that I felt as
                  ...
if it dragged in the middle, and I felt as if some subplots weren't really needed and rather distracting from the main storyline. Nothing major though.

The animation in this series is fantastic, particularly the backgrounds. The opening is actually one of the most beautiful openings I have seen in a long time, I never skipped it while I was watching the series. I also don't remember ever encountering a particular scene that I felt was oddly animated or lacked in attention to detail. I will complain that they intentionally chose not to show one character's hands when they were playing piano at one point, probably to cut down on expense, but the scene wasn't really noteworthy and I just thought it silly. I will also complain that they used 3D during piano scenes as well for the piano itself, but they never used 3D animation for characters, only objects.

So here is the double-edged sword associated with this series, the soundtrack. As you would probably somewhat expect from a series that centers around violin and piano performances, there are a lot of classical music numbers throughout the series. This is great! Wonderful music! But because you have these prominent pieces, every other song that was not a classic was completely overshadowed and overpowered. I can remember none of them other than the opening song. 

Okay so I found two of the main characters to be bland anime character archetypes. The childhood friend and the popular playboy. All characters get an adequate amount of screen time and character development, but aside from the main piano player and violinist, there wasn't anything that particularly stood out to me, nor was there anything about other characters that made them particularly memorable outside the series. Not bad, but not great.

As I mentioned previously, I found that the story lagged a bit in the middle. I really feel as if the series could of been 18-20 episodes long rather than 22. I also found some subplots to be rather irrelevant and distracting to the main storyline, and not really necessary. But hey, if you do enjoy all the main characters then you won't find them really a complete waste of time. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that.

Would I watch it again? I'm not sure. If it was shorter, probably. Would I recommend it to others? Definitely. It's a beautiful portrayal of friendship, young love, growing up, and how illness affects people. But it wasn't a flawless series in my opinion, and it had some room to improve. Overall 7/10."

The show excellently displayed the passion and emotions carried by musical art and left the viewer with a different outlook on musical performance as a whole. Your Lie in April does a fantastic job of immersing it's audience through captivating and beautiful art combined with exemplary music choice and placement. This immersion is a core component of the show and is also the reason I felt it deserved a perfect score. 

The story of Your Lie in April isn't too elaborate, nor
                  ...
is it fanciful like that of many other animes. The story presented is both plausible and realistic; it's a great story and makes for an interesting watch, though nothing about it stands out enough to define it as exemplary. 

The show truly stands out when reviewing it's art and sound. The art throughout the show was very well done and quite consistent; some scenes, particularly that of the final episode were entrancing and showed the true beauty of the show's artwork. I could not bring myself to give Your Lie in April any less than a perfect score for it's art. The musical composition of the show was also very well done. The show focused particularly on classical music; the only downfall of which may be an adverse affect on viewers who do not have a preference for such. It's sensible to believe however that even those who dislike classical music will find themselves immersed in the show through the art and emotional evocation alone. Though, for those who do enjoy classical music you will find the choice of music as well as it's placement throughout the series to be quite extraordinary. 

The character development throughout the show was superb. We watched Kousei (the protagonist) change as a person from start to end; we were allowed to witness him overcoming the struggle of losing someone important to him at a young age and as a result were able to see him grow as a person. Along with Kousei we were given an in-depth look at the past and present of both of his rivals: Takeshi and Emi, his childhood friend Tsubaki, and the heroine Kaori. Extensive understanding of each character is difficult to achieve in a twenty-two episode series, making Your Lie in April exceptional in terms of character development. There were a few characters who did not receive the same level of development; though not enough was left out to demerit the viewers emotional relation to each character. 

As a whole, Your Lie in April was an exceptional show which I would avidly recommend to anyone who enjoys anime. If you decide to give the show a chance I hope you are able to enjoy the experience as I did. Thanks for reading!"

This anime is constatly praised for the emotional aspects that offers, however, this is something superficial if we analyze it in terms of writing, where it fails in everything it purposes. Let's analyze together the issues that this show had and/or tried to hide using the emotional manipulation:

1. Tragic pasts that goes nowhere: Arima suffers from PTSD for the constant punishment that got from his mother, while Miyazono had an incurable disease. Why the mother constanly punished Arima? Mystery. How it's possible that he, just, forgave her without a concrete reason or a signal of her regretting what she did? This
                  ...
one is a fucking nonsense. Not only shows a wrong message about bullying, but, also exposed the cowardly of the writer to solve conflicts in the show. Another issue with Arima is the fact that during the development of the anime he didn't achieve anything. The writer invested more time in another aspects that I'm gonna mention in the next points.

Talking about Miyazono, she's, basically, a plot device hidden in a cute girl with a dissease. She introduced Arima a new style of music and convinced him to play the piano again. The problem starts with the fact that without her, the plot, literally, can not advance, also, she doesn't have a characterization neither personality beyond its function as a plot tool. Even the author tried to give a background to some secondary characters, unlike her case. What is the dissease that she had? Mystery, it was never explained. There are also contradictions with her. If she was planning to cheer up the protagonist and help him with his PTSD disease, why she forced Arima to relive his traumatic experiences? No fucking idea. Why did she constantly make insinuations that she wanted to have a romantic relationship with his best friend? I don't know. The worst part is that this relationship ended being a reality. Why she constantly bullied him each time that he made a mistake to this point of physically assaulting him? It's all a fucking nonsense. 


2. Slow pacing: It was really necessary to have internal monologues that didn't go anywhere in each fucking episode? I don't know. Is a wasted time that the writer could have used to make a proper characterization. Also, we had some side stories from the other characters that didn't contribute to the main plot. Wouldn't it have been better to focus on solving in the main story instead of putting these stories that also got nowhere? No fucking idea. Why the writer put a lot of flashbacks instead of showing what's happening in the present timeline? Mystery and a cheap way to avoid a proper storytelling.


3. Melodramatic and edgy scenes: Most of the emotional scenes presented are forced and overreacted. The ""redemption"" of the mother, each time before an important concert, each time that the protagonist wanted a new partner, the scenes in which Tsubaki was involved, when Miyazono tried to convice Arima to play with her and being a pianist, the physical aggressions of Tsubaki and Watari against Arima, Watari crying because his team lost a soccer match and many more.


4. Plot: The plot was, basically, four episodes of 22, that is the total amount of episodes thanks to the wasted time in the internal monologues and the irrelevant side stories. And, what was the objective or purpose of the main plot? It was supposed to be the growth of Arima, however, the focus was on the dying phase of Miyazono that I'm gonna explain in the last point.


5. Comedy out of place: It is not only the fact that the comedy was introduced at inappropriate moments, but also, in many cases, the program parodied the illnesses of our protagonist in those scenes, which I also found offensive. Wasn't this show supposed to try to take the diseases featured seriously according to the presented at the beginnning? Mystery. Also the comedy involving Tsubaki was awful to watch. Main mention to the final episode where after the major plot twist of the anime, the writer had to perform a chibi scene with her in a scene that supossed to be the most dramatic and sad of the anime. One of the biggest anti climatic moments that I've ever seen.


6. Music: A wasted element during the show. The writer could have focused on the development of the pianist career of Arima instead of the flashbacks, monologues and the irrelevant side stories, so, yes, this element wasn't fully approached here.


7. Romance?: The reasons of why Arima liked Miyazono was because she played a violin and her pretentious inspirational speeches (that contradicts her actions during the show). And from the side of Miyazono, the showed revealed that she liked him in a very forced way during the last episodes. Before that, she only showed interest for him becuase his performances and nothing else. The change didn't feel organic in any sense.


8. Ending: If Miyazono wanted all the time to be with Arima, why did she involved the best friend? It wouldn't have been better that she, on her own, tried to make the first steps? I don't know. Wasn't it extremely cowardly of her to confess this to Arima late knowing that she is dying? This was not only a terrible plot twist, also it gave an awful message about escapism and, also, bullying to be honest. And the worst part is that this ending could have easily been better if the show gave her a better characterization, in order to, at least, have greater empathy with her and showing her regrets of being unable to confess to Arima before instead of being something that came out, basically, out of nowhere and being really edgy for the double suicide proposal.


CONCLUSION

Despite having a good animation and soundtrack, that are the only positive aspects that this anime has, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso fails at everything else. It's a shame that, having an interesting ideas and premise, the anime took the worst way possible and ended being a complete wasted potential."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso,"" or ""Your Lie in April"" can be described in many ways. ""Subtle"" is not one of them. This series really, really, wants you to understand the deep, emotional struggles the characters face and aren't afraid to do so with extremely heavy-handed, poetic, lofty dialogue bordering on cheesiness. The characters talk and act like they are frustrated, middle aged theater actors who would seem more at place in the world of Shaft and ""Monogatari"" than a middle school. I'll even throw in the fact how remarkably fast characters physically grow. At 12 years the kid is about 3 feet tall, but
                  ...
fast forward 2 years and he's comparatively now a hulking giant. ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" has a lot of strange, almost arrogant things going on with it, and yet, you might see a shy 10 score in the top right. A ""masterpiece"" as MAL tries to tell us. 

Yes, I firmly believe this is one of the best shows to come out in recent memory, and it's going to stay that way with me for a very long time. The emotional roller coaster I rode on throughout the show, which brilliantly depicted a young musician fighting his inner demons is one that brought me to peaks of goofy laughter to hollow emptiness. This is a story about growing up through suffering. It isn't afraid to throw in heavy exposition and amazingly tragic situations. Let me remind you that these are middle school students. Music is only a medium for the characters to grow, and as the series progresses it becomes more like a background character rather than the original main focus of the show, which was to bring our protgonist Arima Kousei out of his fear of his own piano playing. 

Even though the journey Kousei takes is inherently filled with heart wrenching moments, it isn't all bad. Kousei's time with Miyazono Kaori, the female protagonist, is filled with wonderfully sweet moments, like candy, and they do in fact do other things than play music. They laugh at ridiculous things, engage in mischief, go shopping, eat too many sweets, and live their adolescent life to the fullest. The world in ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" is so brilliantly filled with color. The color palette used is gorgeous tones of soft, light colors. To the protagonists, who really are opening their eyes to a new world around them, every little thing has some inherent value to them and they treasure these silly times that they spend together. Each memory is a little puzzle piece that together forms a complete picture of our young protagonists' youthful journey to discover the magic the world of music can bring. 

Just like how visually colorful the world is, in ""Shigatsu"" music has an extremely strong presence in everyone's life. Every character feature has some connection to music, even the typical best friends of the characters, and it has a lasting impact on almost every decision made in the show. To some, music is a way to prove that you are better than everyone else and getting more awards. To others, it's about the very idea of performing on stage, where people have come to listen to you, and expressing all those feelings unable to be put into words. Both perspectives are touched upon in the series, mainly in a competition setting, and the most memorable scenes from ""Shigatsu"" are during the greatly romanticized musical performances. 

The show had a very good repertoire of music selected, ranging from Classical to Romantic. The show brilliantly changes along with Kousei's journey to become a musician not in the shadow of his mother. He goes from playing very high difficulty, technical pieces gradually to much more free, interpretive choices of music. Him, along with all of the musicians in the show featured, express to viewers their own little story with their piece selected. Kousei's rival pianists are quite enjoyable to watch as well, and we get glimpses of what being a musician means to them through their desire to overcome Kousei, who they admire greatly. ""Shigatsu"" also makes use of quite lovely insert songs, such as ""My Truth,"" and the soundtrack is breathtaking. It adds such a nice finishing touch on the emotional stories being told. 

The dialogue in this show is very...poetic. Almost too poetic. While all of the monologues are certainly well written, sometimes it is a bit too much. It comes off really, really strong. A college setting, or even high school setting would have worked better, but most people probably would quickly realize no one in their right mind talks that eloquently to anyone. Everything the protagonists describe, they describe in the most outlandish way possible, using metaphors and thought provoking language. It's easy to make fun of the show for its heavy reliance on these Shakespearean-like monologues, but I found them quite endearing and beautiful to listen to. Not everything has to be grounded in reality, and ""Shigatsu"" clearly has many magical moments most people would probably scoff at if it actually happened to them. But, why be stuck in the real world all the time? Let ""Shigatsu"" take you to another, more fantastical world where everything seems to be just a bit more beautiful and colorful.

All in all, I honestly loved ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" probably more than I should have. Yes, it has flaws, just like any of our favorite shows. Yes, it's heavy-handed and over dramatic. Yes, the plot sounds like it comes from a South Korean drama, complete with the cliches we know and love. Yes, the characters talk in a ridiculous fashion, a little similar to how I usually write my reviews funnily enough. Yes, the music eventually takes a backseat for the more tragic events in the anime. 

This show has all of these flaws and more, yet I loved it more than any show in recent memory. It won me over with the beautifully crafted story of a young musician fighting his inner demons and ultimately learning a lifelong lesson and making unforgettable memories. Everything in ""Shigatsu"" seems to be a little brighter, more vibrant, more profound than anything you might find in reality. My Thursdays are going to be a whole less cheery from now on, that's for sure. But why listen to me? Go out there and give this wonderful show a try! I'm sure something in it will resonate with you, just like it did for me. 

And with that, April is coming soon. The spring the characters love to talk about is coming soon. It's March 21st right now, and you bet I'll be looking forward to watching this show again to find out just what made me love it so much in the first place."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"I finished this anime, last night, and holy crap, it's one of my favorites.

Story: 9/10
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is about a piano prodigy, Kousei Arima, who was the youngest winner of the Saki Competition. Unfortunaly, due to his mom's passing away, he broke down during a competition and quit playing since then. The years after he lived his life with monotone colors and no matter what, he couldn't hear the sounds of the piano. That all changed, when he met a cheerful, beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono. 

Art: 8/10
The art was pretty good. The only thing that bugged me was the lips. I know it's
                  ...
pretty weird but to me it just looked like they put on like butt loads of lip gloss. But the scenes were beautiful and the character's were drawn pretty good (especially the eyes). 

Sound: 10/10
From my experience of playing the violin, the sound of the violin was pretty accurate. You could tell the audio was matching the bow directions and the decrescendos and crescendos just freakin amazed me. The piano also. I could tell if the music sounded weird and when it was beautiful.  

Character: 7/10
My opinion about the characters was that they mostly focused on Arima's backstory, probably because he was the main character. Each character did have a little background, except for Watari. My personal favorite was Kaori because you know, awesome violinist that's super committed to being a musician but goes through a little problem that comes between her being a violinist (check the anime out to know).

Enjoyment: 10/10
I FREAKIN LOVE THIS ANIME AND WOULD REWATCH IT ANYTIME!!!! The ending just made me sob like crazy and it's been a long time since an anime has made me feel the feels I went through watching this anime.

Overall: 8/10
I really was skeptical in watching this anime but I'm super glad I did it  and I hope you watch it too because this anime was freakin awesome! 

Well, end of the review! Hope this helped decision to watch this anime! BYE BYEEEEEE"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso/ Your Lie in April

Story:
The story follows Arima Kousei as he tries to once again play the piano again after two years since he lost the ability to hear the notes on the piano after his mother died; but all this changed after he met a mysterious girl playing the violin in the park. The story focuses heavily on character growth through drama, comedy and romance which sounds quite basic and has been done thousands of times however Your Lie in April pulls of this feat in such an amazing way that it feels new with some actual drama that is
                  ...
heart pulling and will leave you wanting more and more through out the series while the romance isn't a heavy focus it adds a nice addition to the series with some real tear jerking moments as well as moments that actually made me cry, however there was not that much focus on the main romance which could have been developed more as it spent quite a lot of time on the other characters feelings rather than the main girl which was a bit disappointing. But in the end I can happy summarize it as a great story with good pacing and a satisfying ending. 

Characters:
Now the within the characters of the story there are quite a few, not as many as long shows (50+ eps) but there are still quite a few, however for now I will focus on the main stars of the show; starting will main male character Kousei who can be summarized at first glance as a quiet fourteen year old middle schooler, however there is a lot more to him than that with some interesting qualities concerning his past as well as his development over the series in which I must say was pulled off extremely well; which can also be said for be main female character Koari who serves as Kousei's reason to take back up the piano mainly by force which leads to some comical scenes between the two, however Koari does have quite a huge focus in the plot and gets amazing development but not Kousei but still it makes her character stand out, especially by the end of the series. 

The next two characters I will be speaking about are Tsubaki and Watari, in which we will start of first with Tsubaki who just like the previous two gets a great amount of development through out the series mainly in the romance department however aside from she doesn't just much else besides playing the classic tomboy childhood friend who will never abandon Kousei which sounds kind of cliché but it doesn't make the series bad; so moving on lastly there is Watari now I'm sure what exactly he does aside from being the typical loud, popular, womanizing best friend that is seen a lot in anime and he doesn't well really any development at all which kind of sad as I would have liked to see him fleshed out more.

Finally we have the supporting characters who do serve a good purpose with most being the supports that help the main characters develop and change over the course of the series as well as most of the supports having interesting personalities and don't serve as wasted sceentime.       

Animation:
Next the animation is simply outstanding with nice fluid animation that makes every heart wrenching, dramatic moment feel alive and helps express it to it's fullest. However there some scenes mainly the comical ones where it swaps to this chibi or maybe a simple like animation that won't be for everyone and frankly it could have done without, however it does not ruin the experience well at least for me.  

Sound:
At lastly the sound.. oh the music is simply amazing with some well orchestra sound pieces that are both great in the show and outside when listening to them on their own and are truly some of reasons why some of more dramatic scenes had such a great impact. The opening of the show are great as well with Hikaru nara preformed by goose house being the first with gets you ready for the show with some great sounds that are delightful and fresh sounding, which can also be said for the second opening Nanairo Symphony by Coala Mode that while as well is a great song, however is just not as good as the first opening and I don't really know why. 

Overall Your Lie in April is must watch for anyone seeking some of the best of 2014 as well as sweet romantic drama with some great music. 


Final Verdict:
Story: 9
Characters: 9
Animation: 9
Sound: 10
End Score: 9.2/10"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Classical music anime and romance combination is not new to the medium. I’m pretty sure some here knows Nodame Cantabile. Then last year, another anime aired with similarities with Nodame Cantabile and probably might be a more tearjerker than anyone expected.

The first half of Shigatsu is most defining moments of the series. The violin and piano competitions backed by amazing direction is really memorable. Not only that, small moments and interactions between characters and individual monologues along with yet another amazing direction is carrying the series altogether. 

Shigatsu’s second half becomes more on romance but it went downhill. Melodrama was taken on a extreme level
                  ...
and was misused. The problems of the second half does not only end in that, it has many redundant moments that makes pacing awfull Speaking of pacing, the second half is awfully slow. Comedic timing is misplaced and destroys the mood altogether. It ruins the supposed drama. Misused melodrama and misplaced comedic timing is a sick combination that can be seen in other anime like Angel Beats.

Although the story suffers with flaws, Shigatsu humanizes its cast in the finest manner. Characters motives were revealed in their internal monologues. Some characters had a full episode to develop them. Kousei and Kaori are both archetypal characters but they manage to prove they are far deeper than that. While Tsubaki has her own internal conflicts, some episodes gives insight to that conflict, because of this she managed to become a good character on her own right.

Shigatsu’s driving strength is its endearing frames and amazing art direction. They have graceful effect on the plot that makes it better. Sometimes, I just watch Shigatsu for that. Shigatsu’s soundtrack is amazing. HIkaru nara is really a unique piece of music and sets up the proper atmosphere. This is backed up by Nanairo Symphony, which is good in its own right.

Final Verdict:

Shigatsu started good but it’s degrading by episode since the second half, but the last episodes came up for it. It’s still a good show but it could be better. (+ for positive things and - for negative things)

+ Beautiful frames and amazing art direction. Well-developed and humanized cast. Endearing soundtrack. 

- Awful comedic timing and weak second half. 

Score: 7/10"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"The feels, Meh feels, so romantic, oh the sadness and makes me wanna cri evrytiem all aboard the feel trip.

This is all I have been hearing from people who have watched Your Lie in April and given the show masterpiece praise for it's ""feel factor"" ""good characters"", and beautiful animation. So as almost everyone loved this Anime, I decided to give it a try hoping that I would also go through the same emotion and personal joy watching this Anime. 

Instead, no offense but all I see is a bunch of melodramatic teenage idiots trying WAY TOO HARD to make everything look sad and emotional
                  ...
while nearly every scene being plagued with unfunny and baffling comedy that pretty much ruins the so called emotion. I don't have problems with comedy, contrary I love it but Your Lie in April doesn't do it well. Not to mention that the story is a drag and pretty much the stays very much the same and takes up a whole episode list just to get straight to one point and plagued with very stupid and pointless arcs. Let me explain the problem with this Anime, oh and the romance is POOR! I MEAN REALLY POOR!

Story: 3/10
Your Lie in April's story is dry as dried omelet. The story had a promising start and for about the first few episodes seemed like a good field trip runner. But the problem already began quick. The story starts with a depressed young boy by the name of Kousei Arima who is depressed in life because of a dark past that ended in a very tragic manner and is now lost in life and is scared to play the piano again because he lost his touch with the piano. Sounds understandable at first, but the problem is the approach to this manner. Because of all of a sudden... ALL OF SUDDEN! A blonde chick named Kaori Miyazono enters his life and because he sees her playing the violin and keeps getting convinced from her and his friends in order to play the piano once again and then he is at it at long last. That to me is a awfully poor way to progress the story with that sudden change. It's not that it was handled bad, it's just that there was literally no emotion to put into it whatsoever and the way that it was handled was so forced and to an extent questionable since the drama and emotion was so forced and melodramatic that the emotion I felt was completely cut off.

The feel factor is mostly the most important part of the show. But I'm going to say something about this part. I didn't feel ANY feel factor whatsoever. Almost half of the scenes are forced as hell and the drama and crying are so melodramatic that I sometimes thought to myself if these were real emotions or just the script and the scenario trying their very hard to make me feel super sad. People claim the scenes are sad and while there can be some little emotion on what happens at the end this all feels like forced trashed melodrama to me and the fact that I was told by everyone that I was going to be very sad and going through a post depression feeling with this Anime made me even more angry. I mean, come on here! So many scenes  like Tsubaki's stupid cry or kousei's worry for Kaori or trying hard to get him hearing the piano again. It's just so obscure to me that I didn't even notice that was suppose to be the focus of the show. I have seen more emotional and feel triggered emotions. No offense again, but these people that consider your lie in april to be one of the most emotional Anime's ever are the same ones that go on saying that shows like Elfen Lied or Kanon are edgy  and bad at doing romance scenes and try way too hard to be emotional and heartbreaking for the audience. For me honestly it's the exact contrary to what I believe. It's not those 2 that are like that. It's this overrated pile of crap that is what I described earlier.

Now I am going to be completely honest on this subject. The romance between kousei and Kaori is perhaps the worst aspect of the show. People claim that the romance in this anime is good. But I'v noticed that no one can really give a good reason on why the romance is good. All I see is praise like *oh it's because of the feels, feels, feels, and feels"". No one can literally explain why the romance  in this Anime is good. Sometimes when watching this Anime I kept forgetting that this was a romance Anime since I LITERALLY DON'T SEE ANYTHING ROMANTIC IN THIS ANIME! They just have a thing for each other and say emotional things to each other and give them motivational speeches and wish each other the best of luck. THAT'S NOTHING ROMANTIC RIGHT THERE! YOU SEE THIS CRAP LITERALLY IN ANYTHING FREAKING GENRE! Like seriously, how the heck can this be considered a good ""romance Anime"" when both Kousei and Kaori literally do absolutely NOTHING with each other other than oh just think of each other and do nothing else. Sometimes when watching this Anime I wondered to myself if there really was a romantic connection between the two. There are no heartwarming scenes between the both. No deep affection, deep love, and stuff that will literally make you blush and make your heart turn all bubbly because of how damn cute it is. THERE'S NOT EVEN A KISS FOR CRYING OUT! Now I know that not all romance Anime's have a kiss but at least they progress the relationship. Ylia does NO SUCH THING AT ALL! So to me this is TERRIBLE romance and this is the plague that is killing romance Anime nowadays. The only 2 dumb meaningful things that happened between the both of them was some stupid scene where they started at each other with fireflies and another in the final episode where some very hardcore and forced melodramatic scene happens where it's [SPOILERS!] just him crying that he's gonna lose her with stupid flashing sparkles and visuals. Seriously how lame...

Art/Animation 8/10
The Art style is good. It's very pretty and the eyes, noses, and mouths look pretty cute too. I'd call it a bit aesthetic and spot on. The animation is pretty good too. Beautiful 4K like visuals that are at least enough to wow your eyes and the scenes being played were quite a pleasure to watch from the eye. Especially the music play scenes. Overall I give praise to the Art and Animation.

Sound/Soundtrack 7/10
The soundtrack is pretty good. There are some nice songs and believe or not but some songs are played well too. Just the problem is they can get really repetitive at times and sometimes they spam Pianos and try to force sad piano songs that just cut off the emotion. But a still good soundtrack at least.

Characters 1/10
THE CHARACTERS ARE A FREAKING ABOMINATION! LIKE SERIOUSLY THESE CHARACTERS ARE HONESTLY SOME OF THE WORST ANIME CHARACTERS I HAVE EVER SEEN!

Look, it may look like that I am over exaggerating, but honestly this is how I felt and I will give my reasons to explain why I think these characters are poor as hell and didn't enjoy them at all.

kousei Armia is a pianist prodigy who excelled very well at the Piano and won numerous competitions to claim the ultimate prize. But look from my perspective he is one of the most blandest and dull protagonists I have ever seen. He is beta for pretty much the whole show and he is a bore to watch and is no cool badass guy like we like to see. His lameness is just there to progress the story and had no alpha motives and remains a generic nice nerdy dork-like personality. His motivation to play the Piano is pretty hilarious since it seems like it was thanks to blonde poster chick that motivated him to play the piano through a very poor manner. Even though he had his friends for 2 years and were always by his side including a female childhood friend who was always there to support him and liked him at a young age but suddenly he doesn't like her and didn't like her at all since it seems like their support to him didn't mean crap all until the blonde chick suddenly comes to change his life. Wow... How strange is that...? What makes it even more funnier is that a age 14 Kousei acts like he's a 5 year old boy and pretty much does nothing else for his entire life which is also pretty hilarious considering that realistically boys around his age would probably be going under Tsubaki's skirt already because that's just how people are naturally. But instead remains an innocent and oblivious minded kid throughout the entire show is utterly stupid because lets be honest, THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AT ALL! You want an example? Go read Goodnight Punpun. It perfectly sums up youth very well. His romance with Kaori is poor as crap and as I stated before he does nothing romantic with her whatsoever at all. Nothing deep just hints and self thought feelings that he likes her.

Kaori is another disaster. She is an annoying stuck up blonde chick that meets Kousei and now suddenly bosses him around with a forced motivation. She is annoying, just there to be the poster chick, and has this illness that plays an important role for the show and because of that illness for the rest of the show, she doesn't really develop well at all and pretty much remains absent throughout the entire show. Honestly that illness hindered her progress really badly and quite sad how other side characters got more development than she did. There really is nothing much to say about her other than be there because again she is the poster chick of the show. She's the main girl and the main girl has to win for the sake of a poor story. Also, her encounter and personality with Kousei is unbearable to watch as she teases him with unfunny attempts to play with him and her romance with Kousei sucks because all she does is... Nothing...

Tsubaki is another pathetic character. She is one of those tomboy side chicks that are destined to get beaten by the main chick Kaori because it's some stupid dumb trope that's been there in romance Anime's since the late 2000s. She is good at baseball, bosses Kousei around, likes him, was always there for him to support him, but he doesn't like her back and then she becomes the side chick that losses. Yep, seen this stupid trope over and over again and hilarious enough this one is done the worst. She is literally just there to fill in the side chick role.

Ryouta is Japanese Soccer player who is currently negotiating a transfer to Manchester United for a record fee of a fee that is bigger than all of Japan's economy.

The rest of Ylia's support characters are obscure and irrelevant to the story. Kousei's mom is this evil wicked witch that abuses him, but then shows him sympathy. This causes a whole confusion if she really is evil. But all we know is that she is an abusive doofus and there is nothing else known about her. The rivals are just rivals and are there to put this DBZ like tournament feeling that goes flushed down the toilet since they are pretty much obscure. Nagi was just this girl to waste time and lead to a useless and pointless arc that really resulted in it being a waste.

Enjoyment 4/10
I didn't enjoy the annoying melodrama feeling at all. There was no enjoyment felt for me at all and most of the time I was waiting and hoping that at least something romantically meaningful was going to happen or least something that wowed me but nope. None of that happened at all... Instead all I got was pretty colors and pretty backgrounds with piano music that sounded nice but not enough to keep me pleased at all.

Overall 4/10
I did not enjoy Your Lie in April at all! I found this Anime to be extremely disappointing and a huge letdown. This Anime SUFFERS from melodrama, overuse of shock factor, scenes that are trying WAAAAY to hard to make me feel sad and worst of all the characters are an absolute mess to watch. I can't believe that I literally wasted at least 22 episodes of my life just to watch something that would let me down in the end. This Anime is not good in my opinion, the romance is one of the worst I have ever seen and it's pretty sad and hilarious too how a vanilla doujinshi or an incest Anime like Yosuga No Sora can capture the theme of love in a more romantic and deep way than this pile of disappointing garbage. The fact that it's compared to Clannad too makes me ask myself just what the heck is so emotional about it other than shock factor or forced melodrama. Sorry, to me this Anime is a HUGE disappointment and a letdown. Only the soundtrack and the animation was good. But that doesn't save it from being a bad Anime for me. Because if that were the case, then Sonic the Hedeghog 2006 would be the best video game in history am I right?"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"Watching this show back in 2015, I had high expectations for it.
Given its beautiful color palette, catchy opening theme, and incredible OST; I had given it the benefit of the doubt, ultimately making the show's outcome worse for me.

Characters:

Firstly, the anime centers around the overly-melodramatic life of our protagonist, Kousei. After his mother's death, Kousei refuses to play the piano any longer. Yes, I understand losing a family member is hard, but this melodramatic dialogue is prominent throughout the entirety of the show. 
Oh, someone mentions piano? ""Sorry, I don't like piano, nor do I play it anymore.""
Take a drink every time he mentions the
                  ...
reasons why he refuses to continue playing, or anytime he makes a dramatic, or depressing line. You'll die.
He's the typical tragic-backstory-protagonist. Nothing unique, honestly.

Secondly, Kaori. She's the cliche tsundere love-interest that we've seen everywhere. Hitting the protagonist multiple times out of spite for ""comedy"". Which, ironically enough, is a trope this show tries to play out, and ultimately fails at. Her character isn't as likable as others put out. She's aggressive, rude, and bipolar, to say the least. Her character literally centers around her lies. Lies towards Watari, and her interests towards him. And lying about her terminal illness. Which, in itself was incredibly predictable for the outcome of the anime.

Tsubaki is more-or-less, the familiar childhood friend character. A sensitive, clingy, and caring side-character that'll never get the protagonist. And, that's how it plays out. Tsubaki hurts herself by clinging onto Kousei, although she knows that he doesn't have the slightest bit of interest in her - only seeing her as a friend.
She's a forgettable character that's only there for the sake of the plot ""development"". 

Watari. There isn't much to say about him, other than; the only reason he's in this show is to make Kousei feel uneasy about his and Kaori's relationship, and is only posed as a friendly rival that ultimately has no other purpose in the show. 


Art:

Nothing spectacular, the opening is decent, at the very least. But, nothing
extraordinary as a contrast to other shows. The only part I like is the pastel color scheme that fits perfectly for the anime's setting set in spring.


Sound:

By far, the only part I deem worthy of this show. The OST is beautiful, and fits the show. The classical hints throughout each piece are great. I love classical music, so this was a hit for me.


Story:

Oh, boy. Where do I start? This show is overly cliched, and I fail to even see how it has gotten such a high score. I cannot begin to fathom the overuse of cliches and easily predicted scenes. 

The typical tragic backstory, overly melodramatic dialogue, are all factors that decreased my enjoyment for the show. 
Kaori is rude towards Kousei because he refuses to play for kids, knowing about his mother's death. And even so, she is continually rude towards him, yet he chooses to accompany her with her performances. 
He's known for ""not being able to hear the keys"", and repeatedly states the problems with his mother. This show attempts to play at both comedy and drama, although the two were not able to mix correctly in this show. 
The ending was predictable as ever. Any terminal illness deems death, as what happened. Even though she said she'd be okay, she died.
The love confession and reveal of her lies were found in a letter Kaori had written for Kousei, and yadda, yadda, cue emotional scene #231.


In conclusion, I did not enjoy this show. 
This in particular is why I avoid romance anime to begin with.
They're generally overly cliched, with general anime stereotypes that I'd prefer not to see for the millionth time.

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"After watching anime for at least 15 years, I have never before come across a show that made me want to fast forward through it (or even drop it all together) in pretty much every episode... Until I stumbled upon ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"", that is. 

As a huge fan of music-themed anime like Kiniro no Corda and even ridiculously cheesy, dramatic and sentimental shoujo stuff like Sailor Moon or Shugo Chara, I had pretty high expectations for this show. Besides the plot itself, the reviews and rating also seemed pretty promising, with people often calling it a ""tearjerker"" and ""deceivingly dark"" in a
                  ...
Madoka-esque fashion. ""Your Lie in April"", however, is no Madoka. It's simply one of the most overrated anime shows in history. 

From clichéd and plain-annoying characters that are impossible to like or relate to (even after 22 episodes), to the most repetitive sequences and predictable plot, this series was a total pain to get through. 

Although some people have said that the progression is somewhat slow, the reality is that there is no progression whatsoever. With a story so obvious and predictable, it could have been told in 3 episodes. For some reason, however,  it takes 22, and by the last one you're so bored and tired of this anime that you can hardly wait for it to end (knowing that you'll be shedding no tears for its sappy ending). 

After hearing a supporting character say the same line literally 10 times (yes, I counted. That's just how boring this show was), you would hope that the words would somehow move you or the story would finally move on, but in reality, neither thing happens. 

As if that wasn't enough, the series also throws in the most ridiculous chibi gags at the most inappropriate moments. The reason for this will forever remain a mystery to me, for they are neither funny nor entertaining, and only serve to kill the already-boring-and-miserable mood of the show and turn it into something outright pathetic. 

Another thing that this anime is often praised for is its soundtrack, but this one is bland, at best. Both openings and endings are completely unremarkable and  forgettable, just as the anime itself. Furthermore, the classical pieces chosen are also fairly common and clichéd, being easily identified by even the most ignorant and uninitiated in classical music. (Humming along to Debussy's Clair de Lune for an entire episode, anyone?)  

With so many failures and disappointments throughout the series, this show's only saving grace is probably its art. Nevertheless, its striking beauty and originality quickly fade away as you are forced to watch the same scenes and dialogues play out over and over and over again. (Additionally, the use of the cherry blossom imagery seems rather excessive, even for Japan). 

Overall, this show was a total agony to get through and certainly not worth the hours invested in it, but at least I will now know to be more careful with MAL ratings and rankings and not jump to watching the stuff that's most popular as I am positive that watching every other less-popular show will always prove to be a more rewarding experience than watching this sappy preteen melodrama that always tries too hard and takes itself too seriously in an attempt to make everyone else take it seriously too."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"I’m really unsure of where to begin with this, so I’ll just run through my general thoughts about the series. This was one crazy ride, filled with a ton of emotional moments, and quite a bit of melodrama at times.

I guess I’ll touch on some of the common criticisms I’ve seen from the series. At times, the drama can feel really forced and over the top. For middle schoolers, they also speak in a pretentious manner. At the same time though, they’re also musicians, and they’re emotional people who express themselves in such a way. Anime is a form of art, so I can’t really
                  ...
fault them for their poetic dialogue.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Finale Thoughts

The ending was foreshadowed and heavily implicated since early on in the series. I don’t think Kaori’s passing really came as much of a shock to me as I thought it would. From her personality, and all of the things she spoke of, it should come as no surprise that she had little time left. I guess it may have felt a bit anticlimactic for her to just pass on during an operation. She was weak, but there weren’t any huge warning signs that the operation could kill her. She kind of just passes on suddenly and we don’t really see much of the aftermath (the mourning). Even with that though, something about reading her letter just got to me and made the ending beautiful.

I don’t think her surviving could have delivered a satisfying ending. The entire series, Kaori pushes Kousei forward so that he can get back on his feet. If she were to survive, Kousei could continue relying on her to bring color into his life. While he experiences tragedy for a second time, Kaori’s death is a completely different experience. It was almost as if she were an angel, just passing by and helping Kousei before vanishing off into the sky. She had fulfilled her purpose since Kousei was able to continue moving forward, thus overcoming his past self.

For the entire series, we had been seeing things from Kousei’s perspective. Kaori was this wild and bold girl who wasn’t afraid of anything. When reading her letter though, we get the exact opposite. She was an incredibly shy and fragile girl who tried her best to change just so she could leave an impact. Just seeing Kaori’s perspective on her life really hit me hard, probably harder than her death itself. She left Kousei with an incredible gift by helping him overcome his past and move on with his life, even if she can’t be part of it."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"What a rollercoaster. 

I am not writing this in order to review every aspect of the series. It is mostly an opiniated, subjective review of what I felt was missed, loved, or completely went wrong. Sorry in advance if I sound like I'm a hater, because that is not what I am. I enjoyed this series to a certain extent, but ... just read it if you want to know. :T

Let's start by my melodramatic rant of a series I had high expectations of at the first half and then let's go into what I liked. You could just skip to this part if you
                  ...
don't feel like listening to a blob whine about stuff you most likely enjoyed since I'm so weird.


Kids comforting each other - not legit : Since when do kids this age start up paragraphs of comfort when one feels down? Kids don't recognize this type of stuff. It'd be Tsubaki's parents telling Tsubaki to go see him - oh and don't forget an umbrella or you'll catch a cold! It's legit when you see videos of a kid caressing another in order to make it stop crying, because it just repeats what its own parents did for them in a similar situation... Starting to say complicated words of comfort and whatnot makes no sense in this situation.

Cat dying so randomly - could have been okay in a darker alternate reality where she dies, but Arima is depressed instead of elightened. Another life he would not have been able to save. It would later lead to him suiciding, or something dramatic as such (that's how I would have used the cat dying part, if needed to be inserted, so it could actually have an impact). 

Naiveté with love. For Tsubaki it's okay, but for Arima it's not. He's suffering from the same cancer almost every main wuss male character suffers from in anime : obliviousity of girls loving them. 2-3 times it happens where she obviously blurts out she loves/likes him and then runs away (hitting him or not) and he just looks at her and thinks it's normal??? Then we expect him to do something about it, but it the scene just cuts and they pass on to another day... uhm... lame?

No motive Kaori-Arima : There should not really be a motive for Kaori to force this dude that didn't play a performance for 10 years over and over again. I watched the part with the letter. He got her motivated to get into the music department... at 5 years old? I don't know, I feel it wasn't executed well; I just can't get my hands on how to express it.

Arima is a drag. To everyone - even a little friking girl. This is a trait that contradicts other people's relations to him. He's a lame ass guy that doesn't do anything unless told and it makes no sense for people to get around him in this manner. Unless he had a mental disease, maybe.

Deserve praise? For all you did for me? I don't get these words said by both Tsubaki and Kaori towards Arima. What did he do for them? Perform for Kaori after she used up so much effort that even a sloth would act faster in order to get him to do it? Or for saying that Tsubaki was not an actual gorilla and a girl... Okay, so romantic for a 5 y-o.

Attention whore. Need I mention his name? He loves being cuddled and recomforted so hard, like a cat. Is he a cat? Is this done on purpose? It completely missed the mark for me. Praise him and he scratches back (btw I love cats, just not this depressed one).

Last minute resorts - shounen phenomenon. Why? Why does it have to be last second? It happens every time Arima is performing. Why can't it be that he feels this way BEFORE performing, instead of as he is currently in session? It makes it so much less realistic than it should be...

Didn't use her death properly. They should have made Kousei learn of her death after the performance he would have been glad of. It would have impacted him a lot more. After such a great performance just for her, he would hear about her condition and be seized by the news. Also, if not this situation and keeping the same scenario that happened, then it should have ended in her repeating the EXACT same motions she air-violin'ed on the hospital roof top while it was snowing; not to mention I felt he was sad instead of depressed to get her back in the end. I think depression would have matched his extreme piano playing more for that part of the song.

There should be no confusion nor bad guys, or so that's what the author wants the image to be, but the image that was portrayed to me was not this wanted one. What I mean by this is that Arima is a complete jerk, but none of the other side characters seemed to have felt this way, except for Tsubaki that mentions it, but I doubt she really means it. She sees him as a liar, because that's what he is, but it feels like nagging from an over compulsive childhood friend more than anything.

Eliminating competition is super convenient for this series. I feel like if eliminating Kaori was the only way for the final scene to exist, where we see that Tsubaki reconciles with Arima and happily live ever after.

Inconsistent character in Arima Kousei. Instead of being depressed over any little thing like he's been all this series, he's living without any worries anymore. Actually, this is the type of feelings he should have had throughout the whole series, but he's always been so lame and curled up over every little thing. Now that she's finally dead, he manned up? I don't buy it. Similar to when he went into the hospital room. I mean, of course he has to feel sad, but at the moment he sees her, in front of him, alive. After seemingly thinking she was dead, she is alive. You'd expect a bit more happiness. But he's not a happy man... until the end when she actually dies. Idk, makes sense somewhat, but not after all this series has made me feel towards Arima and how they built him.

Their comedic relief sucks. Hard. Limited to Kousei getting lifted upside down by his sensei, thrown stuff at by Kaori/Tsubaki, or just serving as a punching bag for any girl since he's a wuss.

Kaori makes this whole story. So naturally, me being pissed about Kousei Arima is not really an issue if you consider he's just a shitty secondary character. Kaori is the one that brought Kousei back on his feet (like 5 times), sacrificed herself for both his and Tsubaki's feelings (and it doesn't matter if Watari suffers, because nobody cares about him, right?), and gives this whole story a goal.

You may have noticed that a lot of this rant is about the last episodes. I think I've said enough, but for a bonus about the whole series, I really despised the repetitiveness of them reminding us he can't hear and he sucks, as well as the fact his mother died. That part was extremely boring and tilted the series to be a lot less interesting than I had found it to be originally.




Now, for the good stuff. Even I need to admit some stuff were really well made.


The letter at the end. It was extremely necessary for it to exist. Else, it would have given no meaning to her death, after that bad use of time lapse (crap, I forgot to mention it), avoiding any sort of complicated expressions every character would have felt. And I also really loved Arima's (wow, you liked something about him afterall?) expressions as he read it, because those felt real and good.

The parallel to the first opening as Arima was performing his last piece. OH YEAH. I totally felt that, it was extremely brilliant and epic, for someone that really digs music in anime. I have not seen many other series do this so well, so I was really surprised. I also really love their soundtrack. I mean, the music they play is flawless in the ""concours"" and it's weird to give the trophy to any contestant since it's literally the song itself without mistakes, but the OPs/EDs and the song called ""Yuujin A-kun wo Watashi no Bansousha ni Ninmeishimasu"" are used brilliantly. Not to mention how great the images they give us during the OPs and EDs are.

Kaori's tears and person. She's so strong and powerful. She deserves better and is passion in person. I really loved this bright character and without her this story would be a complete mash up of Arima's mistakes and messes. So much potential and originality with how much maturity she gives off.

The concept. Music! I long for more complex series that distance themselves from classical pieces, since we already had the popular Nodame Cantabile, but it was really used well. More classical discoveries to be made and this time in a more piano-focused fashion (although I really love violins much more). It truly takes a lot of effort to play at this level and they portrayed that effort very well. 

The art was well and modern (not to mention colorful, but still conservative, which I like - no pink or green haired people). Use of CGI was not overdone, as it was to mostly direct fingers while playing violin or piano. I don't dig it, but it was not in vain.



Well, that's it for my review. I am mostly deceived about this series because I feel like it has let me down, but I have hopes that this series will bring forth even stronger ones, with great characters like Kaori."

Such a masterpiece it is, and who the hell am I kidding? YLIA SUCKS! There is not a single redeemable quality about this anime. I do not understand how people can cry over this bucket of crap! What's there to feel sad about honestly? That this was such a terrible anime? That's one reason  I can agree with.

There isn't a story. The end. 
YLIA is supposed to show the story of suffering pianist, Kousei Arima and his romance
                  ...
with the cheerful violinist, Kaori, who is slowly dying from a disease. Kousei is traumatized during every performance because of his mother's abuse and death. Sounds pretty tragic right? So you know something is very wrong when this anime fails to give me any sort of emotion at all. 
The drama sucks. It's pointless, repetitive, and annoying.

There is honestly no story progression. Kousei gets over his fear of performing and Kaori's condition worsens. But what's the story that goes along with it? Things just happen for the sake of happening! Like hello? Crappy stories I wrote in kindergarten have more plot then this crap!  I thought I missed something when Kaori, spoiler alert, died because I was like wait that's it? It was a huge let down after hearing it compared to one of my favorite animes, Clannad, all the time. Also the romance is SERIOUSLY lacking. It's forced, superficial, and really lame. Kousei loves Kaori as soon as they meet and it really doesn't develop much from there. Like um HELLO! This is supposed to be a ROMANCE anime! WHERE IS THE ROMANCE? Someone get me a magnifying glass to find that romance.

Sound: 5/10
As an anime centered around music, I say it's done pretty well. .. the music itself at least. How the music is incorporated into the story is sloppy! It's not used smoothly and to progress the characters. It doesn't DO anything except oh hey that's nice to listen to! If I wanted to listen to music I'd use my radio. I'm looking for an ANIME here. The music, story, and characters can't flow separately, but yet that's what YLIA is trying to do.

Character: 0/10
There is nothing, not a single thing about these characters that interests me. They are boring people that mean nothing to me. Even their passions for music are dull, dull, dull! Everything's just sort of there, and nothings coming together. There is just NOTHING to these characters. All they do is take the single thing about these characters and keep repeating it over and over and over! Thanks Kousei for reminding us he had a traumatic past since we might have forgotten in the last 2.5 seconds! Super helpful and definitely necessary to our story. Keep it up. And Kaori is really just there for the drama. Really what this anime suffers from is the same thing Kousei is suffering from in the anime - playing just what's on the page! I swear some messed up crap like that happened here,  like some dood made the anime without even making a story. Good, I got one basic trait for each my characters and story? Heh who the hell needs story? I'll just throw in some drama to blend in the gaps! **production staff high fives**
In result, we have a whole cast of boring characters that literally contribute nothing to anything and are incapable of making me feel any sort of motion towards them. 

Enjoyment: 0/10

As you can probably tell by this far into my review, YLIA is my most favorite anime of all time! No plot? No development? No romance? Now that sounds like one hell of a successful anime! 
To be honest, there is one part of YLIA I most definitely enjoy. Pissing off annoying normie fanboys who obsess over this crap of an anime! 

Overall: 0/10
It's an utter piece of crap. 
Hi I'm Kousei I play the piano because I was forced to and I'm always sad, but oh hey there's a pretty girl and now my life gets better but oops she *spoiler alert* dies so okay everyone be sad for me now. That's it. That's the story.
Honey, I feel sad for the grass that gets squashed when it's stepped on, but I can't understand how to feel sorry for you and cry my eyes out for you, so I'm thinking you got an issue there. 
This anime is wayyy too overrated, and really lacks any passion. Just flush it down the toilet like the trash it is and go watch some real romance."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)

There's a certain mystique that surrounds the idea of ""death."" It's the end, the final chapter in the life you live. You often never take it seriously, simply worrying about the big and the small, the important and the trivial. But when you think about it, really, truly think about it, death isn't something to be feared. It should act as a drive, as a kind of passion to do those things that you never thought you could. Are you passionate about writing? Awesome, go for it. Do you have the talent for the piano? Then give it
                  ...
your all. Strive to do everything you can now, because you might never be able to later. Taking this to heart, Your Lie in April springs off in spectacular fashion.

STORY

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso follows a young, junior-high-school boy named Kousei Arima who ""can't hear the piano"" anymore. But on one cherry blossom-filled day in the park, Kousei meets Kaori Miyazono, and his life changes forevermore.

Your Lie in April suffers from a rather apparent tonal issue. Tone in this sense is its ability to maintain a ""correct"" amount of emotion throughout given scenes or particular scenarios. And this begins quite early on. The show is first and foremost a drama. But it often swings back-and-forth with comedic moments in order to lighten or otherwise dampen the mood, should things start to get too heavy. The sad moments are melancholic and the happy moments are hilarious, but it often cannot stop itself from fully driving home those feelings during each of those particular situations. The problem is often exacerbated by the sometimes overdone and overly blatant death flags that litter the anime from start to finish. Furthermore, while certain measures in suspending one's disbelief should be used during some of Kousei's or the rest of the cast's monologues, it becomes increasingly harder to do so when they're ten or so years old in a flashback and expanding upon an internal soliloquy. Such jarring dialogue sounds powerful, but can occasionally cause the aforementioned tone to become further disjointed.

Where Your Lie in April hits its tune, if you will, is in the story it tells. The first half of the anime is composed of Kousei's rise from despondent child to forgiving son. Beyond just introducing the characters and the setting, what's more noteworthy is in its ability to capture the sense that events or happenings in one's past are not meant to control the life one has. Struggle and hardship are a commonality in anyone's cycle of life; nobody is able to avoid difficulties. The solution, then, is trying to conquer such mute-filled points. And what is shown is meaningful: that it's prudent for people to pitch in. It doesn't matter if you are a young guy struggling with music or a young girl battling an illness; what the beginning demonstrates is that what matters most is being there for the person in need.

The second half diverges slightly, in that it moves from showcasing support to showcasing parallelism. Throughout much of Your Lie in April, relationships and the connections that are established are obviously paramount. Thus, what begins to unravel as the show heads towards its conclusion are these various relationships being mirrored all over the place. Kousei is to Kaori as Tsubaki is to Kousei; Kousei the sensei teaches his pupil Nagi, as Kousei's mother did with him; and his mother's condition matches Kaori's, and therefore affects him similarly. As with most parallelism, and which has already been alluded to, this does not mean it's one-to-one. The difference being that each is healthier. Using these same examples: Tsubaki ""confesses"" to Kousei; Kousei respects and listens to Nagi; and Kaori's death doesn't spiral him into a black hole indefinitely but instead gives him the courage he's always wanted. These are just a sample of such interconnected relationships, but each has the same effect: being both purposeful and worthwhile, for both the characters and the viewers at hand.

Even after all this, the anime concludes with one more idea to ingest: that this was and is a romance tale. However, it's very unorthodox, perhaps even surprisingly unfulfilling...or is it? Truth be told, Kousei never says those three little words to Kaori nor does Kaori say them to Kousei's face. But like all of the other musical performances throughout the anime, they didn't have to. Because their music did the talking for them. Emi's passionate pleas resounded from her piano; Aiza's determination to defeat his long-standing rival echoed throughout the stadium; and Kousei's farewell to the mother he's always feared emanated in a way that only a son could play. Therefore it is only fitting that the final performance be not one filled with selfishness, anger, or goodbyes; it's a duet from the heart of the couple that never got to be. That entire segment, combined with the final letter, ends the anime in a perfectly poignant way.

ANIMATION

Your Lie in April is not only beautiful in the story it tells but also in the visuals it presents.

The art for the anime is quite a spectacle to stare at; stare, not look, because it always captures your attention. The intricate lighting effects, the bountiful amount of colors, and the various locations visited either pop or sag when needed, attempting to make up for the loss in mood that the story inflicts upon itself. Also, the show incorporates a ""minimalist"" art style for both comedic effect and to help in limiting the already large amount of detail and animation flying around. Overall, such a tactic worked in its favor.

The character designs also receive a heavy amount of detail. Kousei's thick glasses, Kaori's flowing yellow hair and multitude of outfits, and Tsubaki's tomboyish attire are crisp and quite realistic. The anime also adds deft touches, such as giving the cast actual lips and having Kaori become paler the sicker she became. These niceties were not exactly needed, but having them included was definitely a boon.

As for actual animation, it is very much above-average. Barring the previous jokey art style, the animation keeps up in all cases, with characters moving fluidly during walking, biking, or other normal activities. The high level of animation also persists throughout many of the performances, with the use of rotoscope when needed, increasing the total quality of the presentation that much higher.

CHARACTERS

This is perhaps Your Lie in April's weakest and most controversial department.

Let's begin with the bad: Watari and Tsubaki. Considered ""mains,"" they honestly don't feel like ones. Watari barely has any impact, with his reason of inclusion to merely serve as a means to get to Kousei. While this revelation is given as the show is coming to a close -- and is therefore fine in its use and placement, since it's ""her lie in April"" -- he does next to nothing to support Kousei or act like the ""bro"" he should. He acts as dead weight instead, from beginning to end, without providing any wisdom or notable messages.

Tsubaki is a bit better, but not by much. Her complete understanding of Kousei is what keeps her away. She knows what he wants (Kaori and music), and also knows she can't give him either of them. She therefore delegates herself into the classic ""childhood friend"" role, serving as supporter first and girlfriend last. Ostensibly, she is the person who gets him to realize his desires, but in reality, that's just a front. That is, she projects herself onto Kousei, following in the same ideologies and self-deprecation that he does. And therefore we see similar development: she begins afraid, unsure even, of the emotions she has, goes through a period of doubt and ""acceptance"" of the situation she's in, but eventually gains the courage to take that chance, to be the kind of person that Kousei needs now. She's still supporting, sure, but no longer just to stay close; rather, it's to get closer.

Steadily climbing up the ""good character"" ladder, we land upon Kaori. As the energetic, bombastic, and supremely happy heroine of the anime, she personifies everything that Kousei wanted to be. Not just in terms of a musician, but in terms of a person. She gets to Kousei, unlike anyone had been able to for the past few years. And despite his complaining, his stagnation, and his outward depression, she doesn't let up. Because that wouldn't be her, that wouldn't be true to herself. This is an important remark, due to what she tries to instill in Kousei throughout the entire anime. While she is understandably sidelined for half of the show, her influence on his life is still there. She hammers home the idea that you should be who you really are: a teacher, a musician, and most of all, a friend. She struggles, she fights, she never gives up; and while she may have passed peacefully, that same passion is thankfully not lost on Kousei.

Reaching that top rung, Kousei Arima is discovered. Kind, sincere, yet troubled at heart, he starts in a rather unfavorable rut. But the development he experiences over the course of the anime is unquestionable. As the show depicts, it's due to a culmination of all of the people he has met throughout his journey. Saki liberated, Tsubaki supported, Seto taught, Nagi foiled, and Remi and Aiza pushed; his adventure of finding himself is contrarily done by those around him. And guiding him along the way, never letting go of either his hand or her bow, is Kaori. She epitomizes what the rest of the cast did for Kousei: she too frees, supports, teaches, foils, and pushes him down the right path, towards the kind of life that would be worthwhile and whole. By the end, he isn't the machine-like metronome; he's simply Kousei.

SOUND

The first OP for Your Lie in April is fantastic. The drum beat, guitar, and trumpets work in unison, as do the vocalists, for the first part of the track. At the halfway point, the song picks up the tempo, and the entire piece flourishes. At this point, it brings you along for the ride alongside the dual singing. Before it ends, it skips daintily, closing on a nice note.

The second OP is a small step down from the juggernaut that is the first, but it is still a good track. The quick-jumping and onomatopoeia-sounding lyrics make it fun and light, which is further supported by (the now standard) guitar-playing. Hitting halfway, the background singers and other instruments kick in, giving the song some power that finally ends quite peacefully.

The first ED is happy, with simple singing and guitar-playing to start it off. Eventually, it garners a twinge of sadness, with the vocalist gaining some slight range as well. It's a good piece that contrasts nicely with the drama of the show itself, but is the lowest of the four.

The second ED is a departure from everything. The soft piano and singing is extremely sad. Accompanied by the slow guitar, it only makes the piece that much more disheartening. But the middle of the track becomes entirely hopeful, with stronger singing and stronger instruments. It ends happily, going against the song itself but not the anime it follows.

The soundtrack is a monster as well. The flitting piece during triumphs, the mysterious record-track and one-note-beat combo during those unsure moments, and the water-like, ambient, piano playing track that accompanies thoughts of the past. And this says nothing of the powerful and emotional performances that are played throughout the entire anime. Everything is stunning, both in and out of the show.

Finally, voice-acting is above-average for most of the cast. A special shout-out to Natsuki Hanae as Kousei with his wide range of acting and Risa Taneda as Kaori for her always cheerful and pepper way of speaking.

ENJOYMENT

For a drama, this anime is surprisingly filled with laughter. There are quite a few jokes, gags, comments, and situations that I found to always make me smile, if only to make myself forget about the tragedy surrounding it all. And I can't overstate that last part enough: I cried at quite a few parts throughout. I even started crying while writing this piece. I don't like goodbyes, at all; I cherish the family, friends, and loved ones I have in my life. So seeing it happen here really resonated with me.

And I think this is important. While morbid, Kaori needed to die. Her living not only would have done a disservice to the story and to Kousei, but to everyone who was a part of the journey. Because as my introduction pointed out, death isn't the end. There are so many more important things than dying: memories, relationships, even your favorite anime. Death isn't the ""be all, end all"" to life. For as long as you are remembered, you never truly pass.

While the closing of Your Lie in April brings with it a crushing sadness, there is light at the end of the tunnel for a reason. Light brings hope, fulfillment, and ultimately elation. With a touching story, wonderful animation, and an astounding soundtrack, I'll be taking Kaori's final wishes to heart; I most certainly won't forget.

SUMMARY

Story: Good, ironic tonal issues, thematically strong, stellar ending

Animation: Great, beautiful art style, good character designs, far-above-average actual animation

Characters: Good, Watari is bad, Tsubaki is okay, Kaori and Kousei are great, with the other sides rounding out the experience

Sound: Great, great first OP, good second OP, good first ED, great second ED, great soundtrack, very nice VA work

Enjoyment: Great, I laughed, I cried, and it touched my heart

Final Score: 9/10"

A must see anime for everyone. Personally I ignored it ever since it came out. Something just did not click for me and I put it in my back burner for ever. By doing so I almost missed on ,perhaps the greatest, drama series ever.

It is exquisite in every way. The story is exceptionally intriguing and addictive. You just have to know more. The art is extremely beautiful from the scenery to the characters the artists of this series have outdone themselves. The soundtrack is amazing and it is improved by the amazing visual effects applied to the series. The soundtrack
                  ...
truly elevated an exceptional series to a top 5 of all time series (at least for me). As it is clear by my remarks up to this point the series is highly enjoyable I truly recommend it to everyone even if this type so series is not your usual cup of tea I am positive that you shall enjoy it. It is a masterpiece.

Excuse me for not providing a more in depth review but I feel that this particular series needs to be experienced first hand."

This is one memorable quote from the anime. 

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso or Your Lie in April is produced by A-1 pictures and directed by Kyohei Ishiguro

STORY (7):

The story follows a piano prodigy Arima Kousei who lost his mother and had a mental breakdown which makes him unable to hear the sound of his piano. One day, when Kaori Miyazono played the violin, his passion for piano develop once again. 

When I saw this anime, it reminded me so much of Golden Time the anime just with music. In fact, this
                  ...
anime is not just about music but also struggles that everyday people face like for example coping with illness and dealing with the loss of someone dear. Not only that this anime also shows how people can communicate through music and notes. I thought that they handle that well. 

However, my biggest problem with this anime is that this anime is too overdramatic to the point that I can't take this anime seriously. This anime has too many sad moments that it became unbearable for me to watch. I thought that if they could just focus on giving flashbacks and backstories of the characters, that would be good enough. Like how music can communicate through a person, I thought that would be good enough. Nevertheless, the story was handled well.

My other problem is the over usage of monologues like ""Hibiki"". ""Let it Ring"". It is quite bothersome.

ART (9):

The animation is beautiful. The emotions that the character had resonate when they play piano or have flashbacks. Similar to Ping Pong the animation when the emotions that the character had resonate when losing or winning the tournament.

SOUND (9):

The music is relaxing and I thought that the opening and ending are ok.

CHARACTER (6):

The voice actors at least did a good job.

The 3 characters that I liked the most are Emi Igawa, Aiza Takeshi & Nagi Aiza. 

Emi Igawa is a serious person who shows determination in what she does just like Ryota Watari. Saori Hayami yet again voice over her and she is more suitable in those serious type persons like Yukinoshita. 

Aiza Takeshi believes that one day he will catch up with Arima to become the best pianist and I loved the way how he says that he has the passion and goal to become a well-known pianist. 

Nagi Aiza is cute and adorable. I did like the way how she tries to find her own path to become like Arima Kousei, the piano prodigy. I wish that Nagi would have more material to work with. 

The rest of the characters I thought all the backstories are handled well. However, that doesn't mean I like all the characters.

Sawabe Tsubaki, she is the most annoying girl in this anime. I just feel that her yelling is constantly getting on my nerves all the time. However, I did appreciate the way how she took care of Arima Kousei.

Arima Kousei does not have an interesting personality just like Kaori Miyazono. I just find them uninteresting. However, I did appreciate how they develop their characters properly.

I honestly don't know why Risa Taneda voiced characters that I find them uninteresting like Yukina Himeragi & Murai Kuriyama. 

CONSLUSION (7):

Even though I had few problems with this anime, I still enjoyed Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. I don't think it is the best anime of the year. But I still enjoy this anime regardless.

So for what it's worth, I give this anime a 7 out of 10.

If you're into melodrama and classical music, do give this one a watch."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Music can change lives. This is the thesis at the core of Your Lie in April, a series which examines the ways in which music inspires and expresses those who perform as well as those in the audience. A stunning combination of emotional resonance, beautiful animation and fantastic sound design, Your Lie in April demonstrates the transformative power of music within the lives of a boy and a girl as they learn to come to terms with themselves and and the loss of the ones they love.

Piano prodigy Kousei Arima lost the ability to hear the sounds of the piano after the death of his
                  ...
mother, giving up the piano for good and living a life in monotone. One day in April this all changes when Kousei sees violinist Kaori Miyazono performing under the cherry blossoms. Inspired by Kaori's free-spirited playing, Kousei finds his life beginning to take on colour again as he is spurred on to confront his lingering grief towards his mother and begins to fall in love with the violinist.

The quality level A-1 Pictures has achieved in Your Lie in April is nothing short of stunning, maintaining a consistently high quality level of key animation throughout the entire series. I found the character designs to be clean and memorable, and the backgrounds used are beautiful. The cinematography on display is fantastic and adds a lot of flair to the show, shining through particularly well during the performance scenes which are wonderfully animated and make excellent use of symbolism to portray the emotions of the performer. I particularly enjoyed A-1's use of colour to accent the action. For example in the very first episode, when the world is seen from Kousei's perspective the colours are muted but after meeting Kaori everything instantly becomes more vibrant. This continues throughout the series and is helpful in vividly underscoring the changing perspectives of our two main characters.

Your Lie in April tells a story that is not particularly inventive or unique, but makes for it with excellent execution that nails its core themes. Love, both of the romantic and parental sort, is ever present as a motivator for the characters and the story satisfyingly portrays how people can affect and inspire each other in the simplest of ways to become the best versions of themselves. Your Lie in April achieves an amazing sense of thematic symmetry, accentuated with the use of music and cinematography. I found it impressive when scenes would call back to earlier moments in subtle yet meaningful ways which really helped to accentuate the emotional payoff the series provides.

The power of music is ever present over the course of the show and is used as a window into the personality of each character. Kaori's energetic performance of the Kreutzer Sonata by Beethoven perfectly showcases her spirited personality, while Emi's performance of Chopin's Étude Op. 25, No. 11 ""Winter Wind"" underscores her restlessness and discontent. While the series isn't afraid to directly state a character's thoughts, I found the performances added another dramatic layer which allowed me to connect in a fuller sense with each of the characters.

Coping with death also factors significantly in to the show with the portrayal of how perspectives of death affects both those dying and those left behind. The show's portrayal of death itself is impressively nuanced, portraying its point in a manner that is impactful without unnecessarily dramaticizing dying itself, allowing for a powerful take on this element which I found to be meaningful and tastefully handled.

I found Kousei's development as person was instantly relatable and compelling to watch as he grows from a tentative and melancholy boy to an assured and confident musician. Kousei's experience in coming to terms with his relationships with both his dead mother and Kaori really resonated with me, allowing me to empathize with his feelings when portrayed through soliloquy and in his performances. While his thoughts are often quite dramatic and frequently portrayed to a point that could be seen as heavy-handedness, within the context of how a 14 year old might internally dramaticize their first love I did not find this unrealistic. I enjoyed Your Lie in April's portrayal of Kousei's development into a young man from his perspective, making it even more emotionally resonant as we saw him grow.

While it may not seem surprising that a show about music might excel in this category, Your Lie in April has wonderful sound design that perfectly complements the on-screen events and makes the series that much more memorable. The original soundtrack features a wide variety of memorable tunes which are truly noteworthy because of how much they add to the emotional resonance of key scenes while underscoring the action on screen.

The performances featured in Your Lie in April were highlights for me as emotionally climactic moments within the show. Fans of classical music will find plenty to love here as a good variety of famous pieces are played including the work of Chopin, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, but everyone else will find plenty to like as well. While I don't have a background in classical music, the show's explanations were extremely helpful in explaining the musical subtleties to the uninitiated. These performances are amazingly directed and add a great deal of dramatic flavour to the songs, plus you may learn a thing or two about classical music by watching like I did!

Your Lie in April tries to intersperse comedy between the scenes of emotional intensity and while these scenes allow viewers to catch their breath, they occasionally missed the mark. Slapstick comedy is the primary means by which this is attempted, but this aspect could have been handled better due to the occasionally jarring nature of these tonal shifts. While I personally still found them funny, I can understand why some viewers have been put off by them.

Kousei is frequently subjected to physical beat downs from his friends for laughs but these scenes they are neatly segregated so it was clear to me when the show intended to play something off humorously versus making an emotional point. This is important considering the context of the show as we witness several instances of child abuse, but the scenes of slapstick comedy are used as metaphor and the show makes it clear the scenes are much more exaggerated in presentation compared to the actual events. In addition, these scenes also highlight Kousei's personal growth because he frequently retaliates verbally as he becomes more confident over the duration of the show. The comedy may not be for everyone and could have been executed better, but I find it difficult to say I didn't enjoy it overall.

Your Lie in April succeeds incredibly as a thematic performance, portraying a emotionally resonant story to its audience. Combining just the right amount of distinctive style and thematic substance, much like a great performance its audience is left to contemplate the range of emotions delivered. There is plenty to take away from Your Lie in April, whether it be having confidence in oneself, the inspirational impact of music or coming to terms with death and the series is able to portray this with a high degree of excellence. While I can appreciate that the dramatics and emotional pathos present may not appeal to a select few, there is no question that I will remember Your Lie in April as an example of what can be created when the best of the visual, musical and thematic elements of anime come together to deliver a top-tier production."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Wow. This was a pretty emotional series. But setting feelings aside, here's a mini review. 

WARNING - Opinions & brutal honesty below.

First, the negative shit...

Honestly if the music and art had not been so beautifully, I would give the series a 6/10. Well, even that only if was in a generous mood. 

My main problem with the series was the characters. After watching the first episode, there were two characters I gave half a shit about, the two being Kaori and Kousei . That didn't change throughout the whole series. (I did almost care about Kousei's mother. Almost.)
All characters in the series aside from the
                  ...
main two were bland as fuck. My favourite side character was Kousei's cat. That adorable motherfucker was better than all the other side characters combined.

The story was very meh. Considering the story development, the show felt more like an arc than an actual series. There were many emotional moments involved, but the core story was rather bland.

Moving on from the negative shit....

The art style fit the series very well. 
The pacing was handled very well. 
And the music was just straight up beautiful.

Kousei wasn't just the generic happy-go-lucky MC that so many anime have, but a silent, traumatized character that actually got development throughout the series.

And I definitely commend the author for actually killing a main character. Not a lot of people have the guts to do that.

Overall Shigatsu was a very good drama, but more than that an excellent gateway to the world of tragedy.

8/10﻿"
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is an extremely unique and bold series that focuses on the brilliance of music. That being said, there are a few slow episodes for those of you who aren't the biggest fans of classical music.

The plot develops slowly, and there aren't major twists and turns. There's just the on-going mystery that makes you appreciate and treasure time. 

I have to admit, sometimes (despite the spectacular music scores) I wished the plot would progress more quickly. I often felt our heroine didn't receive enough screen time and wanted to skip past some of the non-essential sub plots. For example, the MC's
                  ...
childhood competitors don't have a significant impact on the plot, but influence character development in a slow, and rather painful, way.

Here's a brief break down of my vote:

Story 8/10
- The storyline was solid for a music/romance series. I felt some of the subplots were extraneous and didn't contribute a whole lot to the conclusion (other than for some serious MC development).

Art 9/10
- Almost as important as the music, the artwork was beautiful. The drowning scenes really make you feel like you're suffocating with the MC. 

Sound 10/10
- There isn't much to say here with words (you should experience it for yourself). The music is what this series is about, and they go above and beyond to deliver a fabulous score. Even if you're not big on classical music, you can appreciate the intensity and emotions described in the music. What really sets this series apart is how each character has a unique style of playing that defines them (particularly our heroine).

Character 10/10
- Being a musical drama, character development is extremely important. There isn't a whole lot of action, but the interactions between the characters certainly makes up for that.

Enjoyment 7/10
- Honestly, I wish I could say I enjoyed this a lot more. I feel there were several slow points or areas that didn't contribute to the overall plot.

Overall, this is an anime worth watching. I wouldn't say I enjoyed every second of it, but I certainly wouldn't want to miss out on the wonderful classical pieces and beautiful heroine (who I seriously wish had more screen time)."

So this anime was Amazing that all you need to know, one of the best music anime I have seen. Just all the struggle that Arima had to go through and over come to get better at playing the piano. The little bit of an love story or maybe a lot depend how you see it but it was good either way. The music and the sound was amazing in the anime and I don't even play any music instruments, the opening songs was great and the ending songs. It was just AMAZING and maybe, just

However, after the last episode, I feel like I’ve wasted 8 hours and was left with an extremely bitter aftertaste. 

Cons:

- The main characters are way too unlikeable. Tried to like them to no avail. Tsubaki and Kaori ruined the show for me.
- While hailed by fans, Kaori is just as abusive and manipulative as Kousei's late Mother. It's almost as if the show tries to normalize or even justify ""the ends justify the means"" kind of behavior, and how did people not see how twisted the perspectives
                  ...
are? 
- The writers throw slapstick comedy whenever they feel like it. They're so out of place that it was jarring. It was truly hard to take this show seriously. 
- Overused inner monologue that becomes so redundant, it feels like a parody.

Pros:

- The music and animation.
- Takeshi and Emi. Although the rivalry between them and Kousei is almost unhealthy, they're still better than the main characters. 

In the end,  I’ll rate the...

Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"First of all, I have to say that many will not agree with this review. When I write this review I think many of my own feelings and experiences in life is included and that's why I am giving them these rate I have gave them. Also, this is the first anime that made a huge impact on me emotionally because I have experienced something that are pretty alike from what we are seeing in this anime. 

Story: 7. First of all I think it had a outstanding plot/story. Because I think it's amazing how a random girl, Kaori-chan, change a boy Arima Kousei both
                  ...
mentally and physical. As it has been written Kaori-chan helps Arima to get back on playing the piano. But this anime shows you a lot more. I mean the summary MAL have given us can't even describe a bit of the plot we see in this series. It's true that Kaori-chan helps Arima-kun to get back to the piano and play it better than he ever did. But in this story there is so much feelings, ambition, friend/love bonds that are very strong. It's actually very hard to describe them with words. I will try not to spoil anything, but the bond Kousei and Kaori-chan have for each other and the passion they have for music is amazing. In addition to the music that the anime is manly about, there is much jealousy, love, feelings that I think many would enjoy. Especially if you love shounen manga/anime like me. :P 

What I loved most is how well the anime fits with it name. I mean there are many anime and manga with very bad name. Some of them are very ok, but I believe this anime had a very good name that fits very well with anime. Your Lie in April. I couldn't come with a better name myself. LOL. In addition, I loved the last ep. and how they end the whole series. I see that they followed the manga's ending, but I think they did a great job. I mean the ending with that letter. I bet it suprized us all. hahaha. I would never thought it were him she liked. More than that I won't reveal. Watch the anime yourself, baka! :) 

I think the negative about the story is that we didn't get any hit about the turn we saw in the end. I know it were sad and all, but I think it would be much better if got some hit a certain person liked some other. I think it's sad to see this after this certain person is gone. That's very negative about the story. 

Art: 8. I think they did a great job with the artwork. They gave color to the scene that should have it. What I don't understand in most anime is why most of the character have a little nose or in some cases no nose. haha, lol. I think they did a great job in the scenes were it were supposed to be funny, but I have to admit some of the scenes were very creepy. For instance, when Kaori-chan were eating cake with Arima, she became a bold woman after eating the cake. I understand that they are trying to tell us that she think the cake is very good, but I think if she were smiling while blushing would make a much better art. Overall, I think they did a great job. 


Sound: 8. What I think were a bit disappointing were the sound. To be honest I liked that the first opening were a happy one, but I think the second one should have been more calm/sad. I believe that they could give it a more sad soundtrack than the happy soundtrack they used. I think they did a good job with the first opening, but I think the second one could be more sad. But what I liked and is very positive is the plays Kousei did through the series. I mean the music they made for it were magnificent. It had also many good OSTs. 

But the thing that were positive is that how they gave those musical pieces sound, because trust me they were many. I think they have done a great job there. I see that they used very much of Chopin's symphonies, but I think it would be better if they had a little bit of variation. Maybe something from Beethoven or Bach too.  Overall, I think they did a clever job with the sound. 

Characters: 8. What I really liked about the characters that they are trying to fight with all their might to fulfill their dream and at the same time hold a very, very strong bonds between their friends. I  also like that they express their emotion a lot (especially the girls, lol) with accident or things that has happened to them. I am very surprised to even see the guys cry so much. I mean how many times were there crying in this series. 20, 30? haha. But again this is to be expected in a shounen series, so I am not really that surprised. 

In addition, I liked that they made the character very open for the viewers,but at the same time left very many secrets (actually expect for one there weren't that many, lOl). They show us that they have strong emotion and feelings for each other. Shows us how strong nakama bonds can be.

One other thing is that Arima Kousei reminds me a lot of myself. How I act, my personality and everything else.  

Enjoyment: 9. Though I am not so much into musical anime, I truly enjoyed watching this series. I feel like it showed us with true friends or better said ""nakama""'s nothing is impossible. I loved how they showed that a depressed and sad character that have lost all of his hopes for something he truly loved, can come back and rise again. Do the same thing, in this anime playing piano, with passion and love like he never did before. 

Overall: 8. Overall I think it were a good anime. Though it had some plotholes and the story were pretty bad in some of the ep., I still think it were a great anime. I liked how they illustrated the strong bond between Arima and Kaori-chan. I also liked how music can purify a dark soul. This were beautifully portrayed though this series. 

Beside the ending of this series and how everything made sense with the last 10 min, this anime also made a huge impact on myself. I could watch this anime and compare many things in it with my own life and experiences. All I want to say is that I have been in a particular case as Arima-kun were, so I can feel with that poor guy. And since our personality is very a like, I can set myself in his foot steps. 


Hhaha, lol. If anyone have read my review (probably not) I recommend this anime to anyone that like to watch musical anime and the same time loves the shounen genre."

The show started strong in my opinion especially on episode 2 which made me like the anime but as the episode goes by my love slowly fades away maybe because of its over the top drama and its comedy( .

What I like about the show is the music especially when they play the piano or violin in Kaori's place. I also liked the OP from goose house the ending not so much.

As for the characters, they are your average Male protagonist and female protagonist, which I have seen from
                  ...
different anime or manga. I can also tell the same for the supporting cast.

Overall I give it 6.5 but I did not make it 7 because it's not fit to have it at least for me."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Long story short, if you're into heavy melodrama, heavily damaged MCs, Classical music/Good anime OSTs and/or great finales this anime is for you. However, this show isn't without its fair share of heavy flaws that keep it from being the absolute masterpiece many people seem to indicating with the score.

To start things off, YLIA's biggest strengths by far are its Art, Sound and its very bold finale. The characters are gorgeously designed, and many of the backdrops/scenery are absolute eye candy (i.e Kousei's first encounter with Kaori, scenery used during performances, Firefly scene). Although some of the younger characters and chibi-comedy moments detract from said
                  ...
score somewhat, the main cast is still very well drawn and the attention to detail is superb. 

The Soundtrack as a whole I find flawless, in both its ability to match the atmosphere as well as being able to convey the direct emotions felt at certain moments. The classical pieces are an added bonus with great interpretations of said pieces (along with some very crisp and realistic animation for the piano playing itself), and the OP/ED songs are very catchy and emotional (2nd half ED especially so). 

However, this is where YLIA's real strengths really come to a halt. The story and the characters suffer where the visuals and the soundtrack reign supreme; quality. 

While Kousei is a fairly interesting MC with great development and depth throughout the series, the way some of his issues are dealt with reek of 'asspull' and just flatout absurdity (even for an anime). 

Kaori's character as a whole is also fairly foggy and doesn't get much development until the end where the audience just gets walloped with  everything that should have been spread out through the 22 episodes.

*****Potentially slight spoilers ahead*****

For instance, his issues with playing piano are dealt with by just flat out bullying and telling to man up. And for some reason or the other, it works. Having a mentally damaged MC overcome their biggest trauma by inflicting said trauma on him over and over again isn't exactly the greatest way to go about things and makes you wonder how exactly its supposed to work. 

His trauma with his mother's RIDICULOUS abuse is also dealt with in 1-2 episodes with some happy-go-lucky childhood memories and a thought process along the lines of denial. And it works, somehow. 

***********************************

The side characters that Kousei encounters throughout the show also end up being largely irrelevant after their individual character arcs are over, and you just end up wondering what on earth happened to them. Takeshi, Emi, Nagi don't even really appear once they're done with their performances as the story shifts back to the dead and beaten horse of Kaori's condition. Watari doesn't even have much screen time at all for being Kousei's best friend, and Tsubaki ends up being pretty annoying (and cliche for that matter). 

Speaking of which, prepare for intensely long and almost pretentious sounding monologue about life, death, music and whatnot from middle schoolers. Amidst said monologues are jarringly inserted chibi-humor moments as well as repeated mention of Kaori's health. 

These things end up detracting heavily from the story imo, and bog it down into its horrendously dull-paced mid-section (more along the lines of the second half as the first half was done far better). 

The finale is strong, however, and is a great redeemer to the slugishness from before. The emotional impact is strong, even if it was predictable and it really is wonderfully bittersweet (almost 5cm per second level). 


Overall, YLIA was a very enjoyable show for the first half that suffered from a poorly paced second half, but finishing strong. The characters could have used some more work, and Kousei's issues could have been dealt with in a better manner. Definitely one of the better anime of the 2014/2015 but not without its fair share of flaws."

-Kousei Arima

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) probably had the greatest hype factor of any anime I’ve ever seen.  The countless gushing reviews I’ve encountered of the series made me initially reluctant to watch it based on the possibility I might be disappointed.  This is an anime about music, one that transcends the genre in almost every manner and one that will pull every heart string along the way until its brilliant final episode.  I was mesmerized from the first episode and I couldn’t put it down
                  ...
to save my life.  Join me as I recap this amazing 22 episode journey and be sure to read with an open mind.
NOTE-This review will contain spoilers.

Your lie in April begins with an introduction to Kaori Miyazono’s vibrant and carefree personality as she chases a cat around the neighborhood with a backdrop of falling cherry blossoms.  Some would call the setting rather cliché but I found it quite enjoyable.  Kousei Arima was a prodigy pianist until his mother passed away causing him to have a nervous breakdown during a performance in which he could no longer hear himself play.  Initially reading this synopsis had me turned off, it doesn’t even sound like a feasible thing to happen to someone.  However, the way it was executed in real time helped clear any doubts from my mind.  Kousei is a few years removed from playing piano and acts as a mostly normal middle school student, hanging out with his friends Tsubaki and Watari while trying to do well in school.  His world completely changes when he meets Kaori face to face during a double date in which she is apparently being matched with Watari.  The love square? that emerges between the four main characters is well executed, and never overshadowed the most important relationship between Kousei and Kaori.

Some might be quick to criticize the high maturity level in the writing of the characters within the anime.  Even I found certain adorations the characters threw in conversations to be out of character for someone their age, but it may be due in part to my own age.  A first love is a powerful one, one that shakes the soul like a feeble tree being robbed of its fruit.  And I can definitely imagine 14 year olds acting the way they did in Your Lie in April due to that fact.  That being said, the dialogue and writing in this anime is some of the best I’ve ever seen.  Each scene was flawlessly paced, no filler in sight and the buildup of the story arc was effortless.  I really enjoyed the flashback scenes where chibi versions of the characters were shown, and how similar they were to their grown up versions.  It was pretty cute.  

The emotional rollercoaster this anime took me on was one to remember for the ages.  As the relationship between Kaori and Kousei grew and the series progressed, subtle hints were dropped and foreshadowing was leaked in regards to Kaori’s physical condition.  As Kousei rehabilitated in the warmth of Kaori’s love, it was at the expense of her own degradation.  It was beautiful but heartbreaking to watch all at the same time, a story that punched you right in the feels.  The music elements were also incorporated well, and it didn’t feel like the series was anchored around it, it felt more of an added bonus to the overall story.  Most memorable for me were the last few episodes.  The lie, so subtle yet brilliant, makes this anime’s title all the more fulfilling.  I found myself looking for the lie in almost every episode, leading up to the big reveal in the final scene.  I was literally blubbering when the credits rolled, and I’m not ashamed of it.  This anime’s story lived up to all the hype for me, and I wish more writers will take notes from Your Lie in April.  Okay, end of gush session.

Kousei’s transformation from a timid and scared individual to feeling like he could conquer the world is fantastic and believable.  He had endless depth as a character, and his relationship with his mother reminded me a lot of myself and some painful memories.  He loved his mother because it was all he knew, and she lived vicariously through his robotic and prodigal piano playing.  This caused him to resent her, up to delivering the powerful line, “I wish you would just die already.”  Talk about a gut punch.  His progressing relationship with Kaori developed his outlook on the world, and he went from seeing monotone to seeing in vibrant color.  I think he was a well written MC and was a breath of fresh air from the typical “woe is me” trope.  Kaori added a nice balance to Kousei; she was playful and inquisitive, living for the moment.  This personality type was easily explained once you got a full handle on her condition.  Some of the scenes with her struggling due to the apparent atrophy of her muscles absolutely broke my heart, but left me so impressed with her ability to maintain such an energetic nature.  It kind of put me in her shoes, thinking of what I would do or how I would act if I knew I had a limited amount of time to live.  Her story and character was so inspiring to me.

The rest of the supporting cast was intertwined quite well.  Tsubaki didn’t just serve as the third side in a love triangle; her character actually had depth and a good-hearted relationship with Kousei even though she knew he loved someone else.  She kind of reminded me of Linda from Golden Time in the way she was patient and not obvious with her love for our MC.  Watari was seemingly nothing but a player, but even though he also had a love for Kaori he understood and embraced her and Kousei’s mutual love.  I actually really liked how ridiculous and spastic his personality could be at times.  Yuriko, Kousei’s mother’s friend also served as a mentor of sorts, constantly urging Kousei to play for what he wants to and spouting one inspirational quote after the other… not to mention that her daughter’s beady eyes were super adorable.  Emi and Takeshi served as decent rivals to Kousei, however I thought Emi’s love for Kousei was a tad exaggerated and detracted from her character slightly.  Overall, character development was done very well and characters seemed believable and refreshing.

The art style in Your Lie in April was cheerful and bright, with distinguishable features drawn into each character.  I thought the character’s ages were depicted accurately and Kaori’s character especially was beautiful.  The animation in general also had CGI incorporated into the player’s hands during scenes with the piano but they didn’t look out of place.  The CG added to the accuracy of each song being played contrary to other musical animes like Nodame Cantabile where CG was limited due to its time of release.  The first OP was absolutely addicting, and I found myself replaying it because I liked it that much.  In my honest opinion, the openings should have been swapped to add to the buildup of the plot.  The second ending specifically was beautiful.  When the series concluded and I found myself listening to it with a backdrop of pictures containing Kaori… it was a magical moment.  The rest of the soundtrack was great as well, and the piano solos were breathtaking.  Voice acting was great on all accounts, most notably Risa Taneda’s role of Kaori.

Your Lie in April was an addicting tale of romance and loss between two young kids with the first love of their life.  It spread my emotions thin and had me growing sad as my remaining episodes dwindled.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue between characters and the overall message the anime had.  Right down to the teary final scene, Your Lie in April had me captivated unlike any anime I can remember of late.  I’d recommend this anime to anyone, as it’s become an instant classic in my eyes.  Thanks for reading the review and have a great day!"

All I can say is that, the music reached the hearts of more than just three people. It reached the audience of thousands and beyond! Such is the beauty of how magnificent and amazing this story of a boy who ends up hating the music he had been playing for years due to something traumatic only to have it cured by a girl under a full bloomed cherry blossoms beginning to change the boy’s fate.

The story is about middle school kids, but it’s much more than that. It’s a story about the love for
                  ...
music and people, an emotional joyride that can’t be described in just words but all I can say is this. A child prodigy named Arima Kousie, who played the piano for much of his young life ends up losing the ability to hear what he plays. Later meeting someone who helps him get back on his feet and regain the colour he lost in his world. There are two other main characters aside from Kaori and Arima;  Tsubaki and Ryota who are Arima’s childhood friends who together with Kaori make up the four protagonists in this show. There is not much to say about the story without spoiling it and much of the premise is in the synopsis above.

The animation for this show is great. A-1 studios has been stepping up its game in the animation industry and although, it’s not as great as the Giant Madhouse, it’s still commendable for A-1 to be able to keep up with the animation it has with having over four shows airing in the season of Winter 2015. 

Music…This show is all about the music. The OST, the classical piano and violin playing is spectacular and tear jerking (yes I said it). At many times the soundtrack will make you cry, but that’s the point of this show. The music carries emotions that words just can’t describe. From sadness and anger to happiness and contentment; it’s all there and it’s all amazing. 

To wrap it up, personally, I started watching this show when there were already twenty episodes out already and I was expecting it to be like any other random love and music romance show, but no. This show was great beyond my expectations. It blew me away from just the first two episodes. There was a lot of depth to that I could personally relate to and was feeling throughout the start of this year. The uneasiness of not having your hard work paying off, the feeling of loneliness and sorrow, and after having watched this show, I calmed down and started thinking about life for all the colours it has to give because black and white isn’t all we can see. It is the full spectrum of colours and emotions that makes us human, and we should enjoy every bit of it with the people we care about and that is truly the gift this show gave me. It gave me hope, a bit of sadness but at the end of it, a light that will lead you out of that sadness and there is nothing more I could have asked from a medium I love so much. The story of You lie in April really shook me, because it’s nothing like your average romance, it was something much more than that, it was masterpiece in the making and I feel it truly deserves a…

Final Score: 10/10

Haven't watch any anime since Clannad, and thought I should see myanimelist top 20. I saw this rated highly so why not. It was great the first half of the series. I got teary eye watching Kousei struggle. But after that 7th, 8th episdoe, it went downhill for me. 

Story:
The story is great the first half because it present a problem for the protagonist. Fighting the  doubts and insecurity within himself. However, afterwards it just drags out with other characters insecurities. It was inconsistent to
                  ...
see comedic bits at bad timing. Hey I love a laugh that breaks the ice, but this laugh just wasn't for me. Understanding the artist was something I have to appreciate in this show. If it display more music playing without the melodrama, the plot would of been better.

Art:
Its about the only redeemable feature about the show. I can see sounds!!! But I thought it was strange to see non-important characters with black dots for eyes. You either think thats lazy or you implied that they didn't matter to have expression. I believe every person drawn should have personality. The comedic bits was strange art where it did get creative but still strange.

Sound:
For an anime about music, it didn't have that good of an OST. The piano playing of chopin just hits me ears first. And only one orginal track that was recurring in the ""im going to be better"" theme was very nice. But come on!!!! There could of been a chibi-remix of bach, chopin, mozart in there in the background, especially in the scenes of Kousei and Kaori.

Character:
Tsubaki? Tsundere!! Seen that a mile away. This is how I describe her: if she violently kicks your shins, she loves you. What kind of platonic love crap is that. If her character had other charms she wouldn't had needed her side friend Kashiwagi, to help clarify her character. Kaori was a bit tsundere, but it was moderately right. I rooted for her just like she rooted for Kousei. I really cant say anything good nor bad about Kousei, since much of it was plot driven. Tsundere Tsubaki, really made it intolerable to watch this show.

Enjoyment:
I watch ALL the first half, the second half I fast forwarded to the good parts (piano playing, key scenes, ending). If the characters had their own story instead of being revolved around Kousei I would of enjoy it a bit more. 

Overall:
It was alright, it had potential to be good, but not great."
Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"When this anime aired, I just lost it, really, I was busy doing other things, watching other things.

Now after I opened my profile here, someone that was a friend recommended it to me, as I asked for their favorite anime.

To begin with, this anime was spoiled to me over time by the very reviews here on MAL, but that's not a big deal I guess. I saw many fights over this, and I understand why. 

Here's the thing with this anime: It does have something to say, but it have so many bad things, like the beautiful art for instance, that while beautiful, looks like
                  ...
one of a thousand catchy animes, It lacks that subtlety that separates shows made with heart ( art ) from those made to be enjoyed by everyone ( pure business ).

It have great moments, and a one single significant thing on it's story, but it have way too many scenes that are just your average forced cringe pushing drama, and a constant attempt at humor that is one if not the worst cases of failed humor I've ever seen (really, no hyperbole here, it is that bad).

But the thing is, I don't watch animes considering why they were made, people need to make a living in the anime business, and here we have a kind of beautiful show, with some rare beautiful musical pieces, pretty bad everything else, and one singular point worth of notice, though made many times before with more subtlety and care.

It's an enjoyable one if you can watch it with your open heart, meaning to take what it offers for what it is, even if in most parts it tries so hard and fail that it is ugly to see. In the end, animes are a business, and while there is artistry in many, and in some points (even here) in all of them, some animes are made with a clear intent to be catchy, they have a clear demographic spectrum in focus, (this case being teens to young adults with artistic illiteracy, that are easily swayed), that while being made mechanically to appeal to that demographic, loses any real creative intent amidst the methods.

Bottom line: do you have free time to spare ? have you watched say... Mushishi, or Haibane Renmei ? If yes on both, and you are a bored and craving some cheap drama, try your luck with this, who knows, you might become one of those that gave a 10 score to it, further driving the anime industry into the pits of pure mechanical business, otherwise, don't lose your time here, and go watch those 2 animes I just mentioned.

The one that recommended this one to me for instance, is one of those. While I recommended him a rare gem of this artistic media we all love, called ""Simoun"" (watch that one and see if you can point me one anime that look or sound like that ^^) He, while badmouthing it, very calmly disclosed that ""he may come to hate an anime in spite of the person who recommended it"".... really, let that sink in gents so you can judge for yourself, the level of intellect of those that come here and give this thing a 10/10...

It's a show that at all times, ""tell the viewer what to feel"", and in such a poor and cheesy way, that it almost makes the whole thing lose it's value completely. 

... The thing is just disrespectful really, its like kicking a dog away then trowing him a sausage and watch him happily come closer to be kicked again...
It's just sad, but it is what it is.

Our lives are composed of moments. Moments that can be joyful and happy. Moments that can be painful and sad. And even when there are moments where it seems that nothing is worth it and everything is seen as monochromatic, a certain someone will come into our lives for just enough time to paint with colors that you had never seen before all over the palette of our worlds. Suddenly, everything is bright and saturated with beautiful tonalities. That is what they say love feels like.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (or Your Lie
                  ...
in April), is about retired pianist Arima Kousei and how his world acquired a whole new tonality, after meeting fellow musician and violinist Miyazono Kaori. Due to psychological trauma due to the death of her tutor and mother, Kousei isn’t able to hear himself play the piano anymore and retires from the fame and recognition he achieved in his career as a kid pianist. Meeting Kaori changes the whole way he sees the world, and she incites Kousei to play as her accompaniment.

Even though this series can be seen as a romantic comedy at the start, that’s not utterly true. Shigatsu deals mostly with love, loss, desperation, acceptance and moving on. The plot covers the truth about dreams and hopes: they all just not become true. All the characters got their goals, but soon come to realize that not everything is perfect. Even though that sounds as if it’s all drama and sadness, the plot has also a deal of comedy, which makes this anime really appealing to see, and that’s what I believe makes the plot really enjoyable, among the somehow realistic approach to the teenage years. Although a bit over dramatic in times, the plot is well structured and is not what a typical romcom is. 

All the characters have their own struggles and visions for the future, not to say your typical teenage angst: crushes, heartbreaks, the future, etc. They all got their problems and their own demons to fight with, which is compelling to see. The development of these characters feels a bit dragged out in the beginning, but it’s just the right amount to have them deal a better impact in the later half. The screen time that the supporting characters got was enough to make themselves presentable and to get to know them and their background, but it falls a bit short to get the most out of them. This comes from the high number of characters it has and doesn’t exactly mean a bad thing, since the principal characters were masterfully and realistically depicted and developed, thanks to the support of these other characters. 

The animation of this show is just magnificent. A whole lot of beautiful and bright colors fill the backgrounds and characters. It’s one of the key elements that help represent the general feeling of the show and it’s just mesmerizing to see. It can convey feelings from love and happiness to sadness and frustration, to name some examples.

Finally, the music. From the actual classical pieces to the background music used in scenes, the music depicts perfectly the emotion and general feeling of the scenes. Everything fits perfectly into the plot, from Chopin and Beethoven to the openings and endings. Just like the animation, the music helps represent the feel in general, and adds up to the quality of the anime. This, combined with the visual representation, makes a perfect mix for representing the tonality in general of the series.

In general, Your Lie in April starts feeling a bit dragged out, although it’s not without a motive. The development of the characters and the plot are just in the correct pace that is needed to wonderfully depict the elements that constitute this anime as a whole. Love, loss and depression are realistically depicted with the struggles that each character is dealing with - and with the use of stunning visuals and beautiful music, the series comes out with a solid plot that not only delivers teenage angst, but more profound themes of psychological trauma and chronic illness. Ultimately, Your Lie in April is the romantic comedy that I’ve searched for so long. It stands out as a deeper form of romcom, and teaches us how, amidst the pain and suffering, someone can come into our lives, even if for a moment, and reach us in a way we never imagined before, to change the way we see the world forever."

As I start this review, I find it difficult to really put into words what kind of impact this anime had on me. Perhaps you find it cliché to read such a phrase, or that anyone could truly have their real world life impacted by a 2D animation, but I am 100% without a doubt certain that this anime has changed me for the better.

Story: 8
As I'm sure you've read before, the story follows Kousei Arima, a piano prodigy who lost his mother
                  ...
and as a result had a mental breakdown on stage, rendering him unable to play the piano because he has lost the ability to hear the notes he plays. He sees the world in a depressing palette of monochrome, of black and white. There is no color, no joy, no excitement to be found in Kousei's world. He spends all of his days the same; going to class, transcribing music, and hanging out with his childhood friends, Tsubaki and Watari. This all changes when he sees a girl, named Kaori Miyazono, standing in a playground playing a melodica. As soon as he sees her, this strange, yet beautiful girl playing her instrument for a few excited kids, the world he sees begins to fill with color. The music she plays is wonderful, and as she barges her way into Kousei's life, he is set on a new course. From here the story is filled with an exploration of their relationship, the long process of recovery, battles between old rivals, and spectacular musical set pieces, among other things. Comedic and emotional scenes go hand in hand; there is definitely less comedy as the series goes on, but what is there is strong and pretty funny.

This isn't just a basic romance story with music thrown in for kicks though, as this anime goes deep. It delves into the idea of young teens dealing with adult topics, topics such as the idea of letting go, of moving on, of maturing, of stress and recovery, and of truly reaching someone, whether it be through your words or your music. ""Did I reach you? I really hope I reached you."" These topics are handled perfectly, and I'd be shocked if there was a dry-eye in the room come certain scenes. The conclusion itself is somewhat anti-climactic (in a good way), yet unbelievably emotional, appropriate and effective.

I don't want to talk too much more about the story, as I don't want to drop any spoilers, but rest assured that it is entertaining and very well told.

Unfortunately, it isn't all smooth sailing. There are some sections in which the story is repetitive to a fault, specifically involving Kousei's inner monologuing. Yes, it is important to the story, but it comes up so often in one sequence close to midway through the series, and lasts for such long durations, that it's hard not to be pulled out of the immersion and get mildly irritated that it doesn't just move on at this point. Additionally, it becomes fairly obvious early on what path the story will take, which may be an issue for some, as it lessens the surprise when big moments do happen. Finally, there are numerous misplaced comedic moments. In the middle of some emotional scene or conversation, there will be a completely random comedic interjection that ruins the moment. Granted these are still funny, I just think they're inappropriate where they are.

All in all though, this story is an intriguing and well told one, especially if you love music as much as I do. I have also not been this emotionally affected by an anime since I watched Clannad months ago.

Art/Animation: 9
The art direction and animation in Your Lie In April is extremely well done. Everything looks crisp, clear, and smooth. There are a couple episodes around the middle where the quality seems to drop a little bit, but you'll know why come the concluding episodes of the anime. The character designs are unique and well drawn, and everyone's design fit their character perfectly. Overall there are no real issues to speak of; only praise.

Sound: 10
Beautiful. Spectacular. Sensational. Amazing. Perfect. Breathtaking. Stunning. Fantastic. These are all words that could describe the sound in Your Lie In April. The first OP song is one of the best, if not the best, in all of the anime I've seen. I bought it on iTunes after hearing it for only the second time. The ED songs are very appropriate, especially the second one. And the original score? My god, I couldn't possibly write enough praise about the OST. Since I finished the series, I've hunted down all of the songs on YouTube and been listening to them near non-stop. Should I find the soundtrack on CD somewhere, I would buy it in a heartbeat. The emphasis on piano and violin, including classical music, is extremely refreshing. The ambient songs that play during the non-performance scenes are similarly fantastic; there is again an emphasis on piano and violin, with some light electronic elements thrown in to create such a beautiful blend of sound. If you've seen the anime, or are just looking for an example of the music which I can't adequately describe, look up ""Spring's Melody,"" ""I'm A Violinist,"" ""I'll Never Forget Today,"" ""A Presence Like A Little Brother,"" ""Again,"" ""My Truth,"" or ""Truth And A Lie."" I won't be able to hear ""Love's Sorrow,"" or Chopin's Ballad No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23 the same ever again. And the conclusion itself has quite possibly the best song choices I've ever picked up on. Following the conclusion of the anime, I immediately moved Your Life In April to my #1 OST of all time. Trust me, if you have any sort of appreciation for music in general, but especially classical music, you will absolutely love the music in YLIA.

Character: 8
I greatly enjoyed the characters in Your Lie In April. They were well designed, as mentioned in the Art/Animation section, and all very unique while playing their own important role in the series. They were charming, entertaining, funny, touching, and realistic. Kaori beating around the bush, Kousei's struggles to move on, Tsubaki's mixed feelings, and Watari's desire to be #1 whilst being there for his friends are all on display in full force. Kousei's mother, Kousei's tutor (Seto), his two rivals, Emi and Takeshi, and his student, Nagi, also all receive their own backstories. It's quite impressive that in a 22 episode run time, I genuinely cared for all of the characters, and they managed to not only include backstories for everyone, but meaningful development (going with the topic of moving on and maturing mentioned earlier).

Kousei by and far has the most development and backstory focus, which makes sense because he's the protagonist. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the story section, sometimes they will repeat certain scenes from his backstory, which gets old and repetitive. For the most part though, his story is well done. Other characters whom receive the better treatment are Kaori, Tsubaki, Kousei's mother, Seto, Emi, Takeshi, and Nagi.

Watari, on the other hand, gets screwed over. He's definitely a good guy and genuinely wants to help his friends, that much is clear. However, he gets next to no backstory (only really shown with Kaori and Tsubaki as kids, and even then he's in the background), and gets next to no development (aside from a brief scene in the final episode and one other scene midway through). His backstory and development were definitely lacking, which was too bad as he was a character I wanted to get to know more.

Aside from Watari, the characters were well crafted. As mentioned, their backstories and development were intriguing and helped the viewer to connect to them in a personal way. They all had noticeable flaws and weaknesses that were key in said developments, and watching the characters work to overcome their flaws and weaknesses and truly grow as people was a delight.

Enjoyment: 9
Do you like music? Do you like character development and delving into emotional back stories? Do you like crisp art and animation? Do you like enjoyable and relatable characters? Do you like a well told, emotional story? Then you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you dislike melodrama, perhaps you should stay away, but we're dealing with late middle schoolers here; it's expected.

I loved the story. I loved the art and animation. I loved the characters. I was blown away by the soundtrack. Your Lie In April was a highly enjoyable, relatable, and emotional ride, and it's one that I'll be taking again and again in the years to come. This is certainly one of the season's best anime, if not the best, and deserves a spot on anime forums and ""top lists"" for a long time to come. I know it will be on mine, and I know that I'll be recommending this to all of my friends. It's hard to say goodbye to a series I enjoyed so much that I had to binge watch the entire thing in under 24 hours, but I have the soundtrack to bring with me wherever I go, and hope that this review has helped you in some way in your decision to watch Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or Your Lie In April.

Overall: 9/10

A lot of people seemed to enjoy this anime and think of it as a masterpiece. Personally, I think it's a (lovely) rip-off and typical Dramaromance-Kit of every.single.Drama. 

Story 

After the first episode, you literally know how this anime proceeds and ends. If you're experienced with anime like this (Romance, Drama, stuff) you also know all the intermediate steps. After the first Episode. basically, you dont need to watch the other 21 episodes, because you're right, that's exactly how it goes and ends. YLIA does over a long stretchtime nothing to surprise you, instead rattles down his Dramance-Model kit with twists and
                  ...
turns you can see coming miles and miles before. That's not necessary bad, because many Dramance-Anime do this. Difference is, they do it in a creative way somehow. YLIA isn't creative or entertaining in his copying. It feels like you're watching something you've watched a thousand times before. In fact, you did. 

Characters

Nearly all of the characters are shallow and/or stereotypes, with some rare exceptions on the side-characters. The protagonist is the quiet, traumatized genius, introverted and overall not really social, no outstanding personality-traits, allthough there's at least a development through the story. not a big one, though. Tsubaki is the typical Childhoodfriend-character, and I say this by ALL MEANS. It doesn't take more than her first appearence and you know what she feels. She's a rude tomboy, cheerful and of course, wont admit certain things until the end, eventhough the complete cast, including us, knows better. Kaori basically has no personality. She's hyperactive, cheerful, innocent and overall just a plot-device to produce drama and make kouseis boner glow. She has no development and there are no deeper insights in her personality, which is actually a shame, she could have been a good character. rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning, a brother-worshipping girl, competition-focused teens for Kousei, his rude, brutal, female mentor, the cool, icy  friend of Tsubaki and so on. YLIA is a picture book of old, discarded stereotypes. at least they're not annoying, and that is a really good point. Not a single one of the characters is really annoying over 22 episodes. Most anime dont manage this, so even if no character is interesting, they're not terrible either.

Art

The art is kinda good. Nothing marvelous, nothing extraordinary, but well-done over the progress of the anime and with some nice artworks. If I can say a bad thing about the art, then that it's boring, maybe. Nothing outstanding in the mass of averageness. 

Sound

Naturally the best part of the Music-Anime. While the OPs and EDs are all boring, clichéd and uncreative scrap, the classic (piano-)music in the series itself always hits the tone and is worth to get listened to. The Soundtrack is memorable, especially the maintheme is a likeable piece you wont forget so quick, but aside from that... again, kinda boring. nothing really intense, nothing outstanding. still, your ears are well-threated in YLIA. 

Overall

I have to admit I didn't enjoy watching Your Lie in April for a single moment. I think of the 22 episodes as a waste of time, but there's a high chance you'll disagree. If you dont mind knowing the complete plot and all characters from the first episode, and watching 22 episodes of a drama-anime-kit you already watched 4000 times before, you may enjoy this shoal, peaceful anime who takes much room for the insight and feelings of his characters. If you liked Clannad, you'll definitely love Your Lie in April. Funny enough, I loved Clannad. Just... dont expect any surprise. Or you will get disappointed. Promised."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Mixed Feelings,"Re:Zero truly wanted to be something. It shoots for the stars, it tries new things and throws the characters through so much torture and misery that the fantasy-world they are living in resembles more a hell. They boil in this hell, fuming with anger and regret, any shred of happiness they find fading almost immediately to nothing. 

But Re:Zero isn't something. It reaches for its dear, dear life, but remains in the end wholly unremarkable shounen fare interested more in shocking the viewer with gore and theatrics than in telling a genuinely meaningful story. Re:Zero may not be terrible and irredeemable, but it certainly struggles
                  ...
throughout most of its twenty-five episodes to demonstrate that there is more to it than this. What is there in Subaru's tragic story that the audience can take with them at the end? What does it want to say? Not a whole lot, to be sure. Re:Zero is ambitious in mediocrity, notable only for its perverted sense of drama. 

(Minor spoilers will follow from here, as it is near-impossible to discuss an anime like this without revealing anything.)

I have seen many people compare Re:Zero to Steins;Gate in the months since its airing. This is a great disservice to Steins;Gate. Where Steins;Gate spent nearly half its runtime developing the setting and its characters before asking the audience to empathise with and feel for them, Re:Zero does so immediately and does not ever ask for consent. It never develops its setting in any meaningful way-- about all you know for the duration of the story is that it is generic fantasy-land where people hate witches and bad things happen all the time-- and it throws death and gore at the viewer from the very first episode, when nobody even knows or cares about who Subaru is. It is shocking to see major characters die within the first episode, to be fair, but it no longer feels shocking the second, third or eleventh time. 

If there was any consequence to these events, it is immediately brought to nothing by the show's contrived gimmick of rebirth and time-travel. It doesn't really matter if someone does die, as time will conveniently bend backwards for Subaru's sake-- never to the beginning, and always to the last major event in the story. There is no cost and no meaning to anything that happens. Subaru's mistakes are immediately erased upon rebirth, and he can go on about his day with nothing but his own guilt holding him back. He is the God of his story and the world is his playground. 

What Re:Zero does to compensate for this is killing its characters off in increasingly brutal ways. They will lose their limbs, be hacked to death by chains or tortured to the point where they no longer resemble a human being. It is violence without meaning, as artificial as can be, extreme and over-the-top to the point that it can almost at times resemble satire. Everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong for Subaru and friends, long before you are given any reason to care about their fates„ÄÄin the first place. The fifteenth episode is easily the biggest offender in this regard as it is nothing more than one massive slaughterfest, intent on making you feel bad for Subaru and his many waifus, him screaming in rage and gurgling on blood like it is some sort of torture porn. It is entirely possible for fiction to contain elements of death and gore without it negatively affecting the story, and in some cases it is even necessary, as it is for stories focused on issues such as war. Death is an entirely natural phenomenon, and humans are evidently not above committing acts such as murder. The issue with Re:Zero is that its death and gore exists for itself. It exists to shock and enrage the viewer, rather than serving as a product of the setting or as a vehicle for more substantial themes. For some people, this works, and throwing a character through a hurricane of awfulness is enough to instil sympathy. That's great, and I don't hold any ill will against these people. If anything, I am envious of how easily they can feel emotion. What actually bothers me is how effortless this method of storytelling truly is, and the audacity Re:Zero has to pretend it is something profound and on-par with film, as it did in the credits of the fifteenth episode. Re:Zero is visceral and sensually striking, and yet ever so empty. 

""Empty"" can easily be used to describe the characters as well. Emilia, for example, exists as little more than a personification of the average anime fan's ideal woman, similar in many ways to Asuna from Sword Art Online, and lacking in any meaningful characterisation besides her occasionally getting upset at Subaru. It's even more baffling that Subaru chooses her in the world of romance when she has done very little to win over his affection or  help him, aside from giving him a place to stay for a couple days. She may as well not even exist-- the only reason she even does is to create more senseless tragedy for Subaru. 

Rem and Ram are much better characters, as they actually have legitimate characterisation, backstory and development over the course of the story. The issue with them, particularly Rem, is that this development occurs so suddenly that it feels more like a complete change in character than an extension of who they really are. Rem  goes from hating Subaru's guts to being so completely in-love with him that she is willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth and sacrifice anything for his sake. To be fair, there is reason for this abrupt change in personality: Subaru is one of the only people who has ever shown her kindness, and he did so selflessly, on several occasions, without regard for his own safety. He does a great deal to win over her trust and respect. But the extent to which she loves him, especially when she was still cursing his name just a couple short episodes before, is so extreme that it feels less like a natural progression of her feelings and more a way to instil feelings of love in the viewer, to make her palatable to otaku, an ideal girlfriend of sorts, a ""waifu"" much as Emilia is. It is very hard to convince me that her feelings are anything more than a fleeting puppy-love when merely showing her a bit of kindness is enough to immediately turn Subaru from her most-hated person in the world to her most-cherished one. It feels fake-- it feels like a lie, as many things in Re:Zero are revealed to be.

Betelguese, as creepy a bastard as he is, is by far one of the most obnoxious presences in the entire show. He is there, presumably, to create a sense of horror, as he will bend his body in unnatural ways, chew off his fingers in anger and bleed from his creepy little eyeballs, among other things. In reality, he is so loony and ridiculous that anything he says or does feels immediately silly, destroying any of the supposed horror he was supposed to generate. See, the thing most anime get wrong with horror (and indeed even most fiction in general) is that a truly terrifying character is not a raging lunatic, but rather someone totally ordinary and conscious of their actions. Hannibal Lecter is scary. Betelguese is anything but. If you want me to feel scared, do so in a way that resembles a reality humans can actually relate to, rather than a fantasy made of the likes of ghosts and goblins and bowl-cutted priests who eat their fingers for no reason. 

Most of the side characters are weak and one-dimensional as well, as they either serve as more empty harem material (with flat-out catgirls and lolis), are defined by a single-trait or  catchphrase (as Beatrice and Roswaal are), or are there as a weak attempt to instil more horror, like the stupid kid on the carriage (whose name I forget because I was too busy being angry at his annoying voice and how dumb the scene was) who completely breaks character and turns into a raging lunatic in another shallow attempt to push the story in a dark direction. The one main exception is Wilhelm, whose backstory and motivations truly do feel meaningful and justified. It is just a shame that he is immediately thrown to the benches again once this backstory reaches its quick end, serving afterwards as little more than some old dude who is skilled with the sword. 

This leaves our buddy Subaru. I think, without exception, he is the factor that determines one's enjoyment of Re:Zero. If you can put up with his utter stupidity, you will find it possible to empathise with the trauma he goes through and his mental breakdowns that follow. If you are annoyed and disgusted with his presence (as I regularly was), it will be virtually impossible to care about most of what occurs. Subaru is the difference between being a fan of Re:Zero and being someone who actively dislikes it.

In many ways, he resembles a typical shounen hero. He is hot-headed, makes frequent out-of-place jokes (which I never once found funny, by the way), and refuses to ever think things through in a logical process, preferring instead to jump into battles he cannot win or to lash out at innocent people merely because his pride and fragile ego are called into question by his own mistakes. He thinks he is the coolest dude in the world, that he can save everyone through his own power, and the mere presence of someone with more skill than him offends him right to the very core. He yells and cries on a regular basis and seems incapable of having a normal conversation with anyone. Subaru is a child, and without any doubt one of the more infuriating characters I have witnessed in perhaps ever. There were points in the story where his characterisation legitimately made me angry and made me want to stop watching the show. Some moments were honestly baffling, too, such as how he switches from being completely mind-broken during the events of the fifteenth episode to being totally normal (albeit with a desire for revenge) in the next. 

I say all this, but the eighteenth episode is actually one of the best episodes of anime I have seen in quite some time. 

Let me explain. 

Where the first two thirds of the anime spent its time showcasing unnecessary gore, Subaru's stupidity and empty characters who exist for little more than space on hug pillows and other creepy merchandise, the eighteenth episode redeems the anime and gives meaning to all that has happened, even if it doesn't erase its mistakes. It is an episode dedicated entirely to characterisation. It is a single conversation where Subaru shows remorse for his actions, recognising all the mistakes he has made and why he kept making them. He understands that he is a deeply flawed, broken person incapable of saving anyone or indeed even himself. It is at this moment that Subaru becomes aware of who he is. And you know what? I stopped hating him as a result, even if I still fundamentally disagreed with his actions and his character. He showed himself to be a human being for the first time in the entire story.

I have great respect for scenes such as these. It's not often we get entire episodes dedicated to something as ordinary as a conversation. Re:Zero didn't need to use gore and death to identify its characters or make us care - it did so merely by giving Subaru a stage to speak. This leaves just one question: why didn't Re:Zero do this from the very beginning? 

It's a bummer, as there was actually potential for a great anime. The pieces were there, and the writer and the staff behind the anime demonstrated that they had the talent to execute things in an effective and honest way. The music is excellent, complimenting Subaru's struggles without ever going overboard in sappy piano pieces and cacophonous orchestral pieces as many shows of its type tend to. Its visuals look totally fine, maintaining a consistent quality despite the longer-than-average episode count and abundant battle scenes, while the facial expressions, if occasionally a bit excessive, are undeniably effective at demonstrating the characters' pain and anguish. Re:Zero is very much a well-produced anime; you can tell that the people at White Fox truly wanted to create something special. 

I think this is why, even if I was bothered by most of the things I witnessed during my viewing of Re:Zero, I don't think it is a truly awful anime. It may not be a good one, not by any means-- its mistakes cannot be so easily erased-- but I do think its consistent effort and its eighteenth episode do at least redeem it to the extent of being a passable anime. It's why you see me giving Re:Zero a mediocre rating in my review rather than a poor one. I dislike much about Re:Zero, but for that one episode, I was a fan. 

I have a feeling I am in the minority here, as opinions on Re:Zero almost seem to be split into a dichotomy.  It is the best anime ever made for some, a life-changing adventure packed with emotion, and for the rest, it is a pile of irredeemable refuse aimed at the lowest-common denominator. To be perfectly fair, I am far more critical of Re:Zero than I am supportive of it. Its issues are certainly more numerous than its good points, and having one great episode can only take things so far when the other twenty-four vary from terrible to merely OK. But I'll be damned if I said it wasn't worth putting up with all the nonsense to get to that one point in the story. I just don't know if others are nearly as patient as I am, and I do have my doubts that future material will ever come close to that level of quality again.

Chances are, you'll have a better time with Re:Zero than I did. Many anime fans aren't looking for anything especially profound or complex in their entertainment, and I do not say that to be arrogant or dismissive. It is perfectly valid to watch anime for its entertainment value-- I do it as well, and so does just about anyone who is honest with themselves. 

But this is a review and not a fan-piece. I am here to share my opinions and to judge the anime with a critical, yet fair eye. Re:Zero has a great deal of issues when viewed under these lenses, and none of them are insignificant. No matter how emotional its copious amounts of death and suffering made you, it would be quite hard to argue there is much more value to Re:Zero than its spectacle. It is a master at manipulating the audience's feelings, and while it succeeds at entertainment and has one special little moment, Re:Zero fails at making the case that it is anything more than lavishly produced, yet cheap theatre.

The question is, is that enough for you?

It wasn't enough for me."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"*Re:minder - This review contains some light spoilers*

From my perspective, we are living in a time where well crafted anime with a myriad of originality and detail are unfortunately being released at a frequently declining rate. Because of this, many in the anime community are constantly on the lookout for something new and creative. So naturally, when an anime like Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu airs, a show that boasts morbidly unique twists on the popular but overused fantasy/game world genre, it gains a lot of popularity and is generally well received in the anime community. However just because something is innovative doesn't mean that
                  ...
it is a good show overall. No, there are other characteristics, such as a detailed plot and a well developed cast, that can elevate a show from being simply different to something great. So is Re:Zero a great anime? I honestly believe that it is.

And not just because there's a totally badass adorable maid in it who fulfills the desires of every man's heart besides the romantically challenged main character who blatantly rejects her feelings for him. What a heartless monster!

Plot: 9/10

I never thought that any anime would be able to effectively combine dark psychological elements with an upbeat fantasy setting. However the genius behind Re:Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki, was able to expertly mix the two seemingly incompatible genres together, and the results are quite impressive. The show begins with our protagonist Natsuki Subaru getting suddenly transported to a fantasy world after leaving a convenience store. Being an otaku who has probably dreamed about something like this happening to him for years, Subaru is naturally excited to be in this new world. However, to his dismay, Subaru quickly learns that he doesn't have any special abilities or powers. Or so he thinks...anyway, he encounters the beautiful half elf Emilia when she saves him from a group of thugs. Thus the two of them start their adventure. This beginning seems quite clich√©d, however everything changes dramatically when Subaru soon finds himself dead.

Well, that was unexpected. The protagonist dies before the first episode even ends? Really? Well we soon learn that Subaru actually does possess a magical ability, called return from death. However this power only works when Subaru dies. When this skill activates, Subaru essentially travels back in time to a certain checkpoint to relive that part of his life in order to change it to a future in which he successfully completes a certain objective and lives. Being a fan of shows involving time traveling, I was excited to see where Nagatsuki was going with this, and I wasn't disappointed with the result.

I was initially worried that Re:Zero would end up getting boring with the protagonist constantly failing and traveling back in time to relive the exact same scenarios over and over again. However with each new life, the progression of the story alters, sometimes dramatically, and many new elements are revealed to Subaru which were previously unknown that help him to solve the problems he faces and move on. This kept the anime fresh and exciting since something different happened with each life. Also, with every passing arc, Subaru's situation seemed to become substantially more dire, which lead to an increased intensity in the anime that kept me constantly entertained.

One negative aspect of the show that I've noticed is that Re:Zero seems to rely and focus on Subaru's ability a bit too heavily. This consistent emphasis on return from death takes away from other things, such as the detail revolving around the royal selection. This is seemingly an important plot point, but it is significantly overshadowed by the constant focus on Subaru and his continuous retakes at life. The anime spends an episode or two describing the royal selection and emphasizing its importance in relation to the characters only to practically drop it and hardly mention anything about it throughout the rest of the anime. There are some other similar occurrences present in Re:Zero as well. This resulted in the loss of plot points that could have made the anime more well rounded.

Art: 7.5/10

The character designs are very lovely. They are usually rather detailed, especially their facial expressions and features during moments when their faces are zoomed in on. Vibrant colors also help to bring the characters and scenery to life. Unfortunately, like many other shows in the industry, the animation dipped in quality as the anime progressed. The most notable example would be the fight scenes. Those showcased in the anime's initial episodes were highly detailed and well executed. However some of the later battles seemed more sloppy and not as well animated. Also, the CGI used on some background characters was utterly appalling. Luckily the use of CGI is very limited in this show. But hey, at least the female characters still maintained their lovely features throughout the entirety of the anime, and that's what really counts, right?

Sound: 9/10

I was excited when I learned that Konomi Suzuki and Myth&Roid would be performing the theme songs for this anime since I enjoy music produced by both of them. Overall, I think that the theme songs are rather good, with my personal favorite being the first ending, Styx Helix, by Myth&Roid. The soundtrack was successful; it played upbeat and relaxing songs during lighthearted scenes and transitioned to dark and distorted themes during psychological moments. Subaru's seiyuu, Kobayashi Yuusuke, does an excellent job at vocally expressing the character's utter pain and misery through his voice acting talents.

Characters: 9/10

At first glance, many of the characters in Re:Zero appear to fall into generic character categories. However as the anime progresses, the cast seems to evolve from their seemingly average state into much more dynamic, unique, and sometimes even lovable characters. 

Subaru surprisingly isn't some overpowered MC who can unexplainably beat every other character at practically everything. In fact, his only ability worth noting is return from death, which, while being extremely useful since it gives Subaru multiple chances at life, is the main source of his psychological trauma. Although he initially acts positive, Subaru slowly cracks and falls further into despair and insanity as the anime progresses. He is one of the few characters I've seen that, for the most part, actually acts like a real life human would in the dark situations that he finds himself in. Of course, this may mean that you'll want to punch him in the face sometimes when he acts all cowardly, stupid, and obnoxious, but you have to understand what the poor guy is going through. Plus he redeems himself in the later portion of the anime.

Emilia is a beautiful, kind, and lovable girl; in other words, the type that many view as great waifu material. However the thing that I like most about her is the fact that she, unlike so many other female characters like her, can actually live WITHOUT the male lead. During one point she actually decides that it's best for her and Subaru to go there separate ways. I find this to be rather admirable, since it shows that Emilia can be an independent person who doesn't need to rely on others. There's not much else to say about her since she hardly gets any screen time in the second half of the anime.

Rem surprised me the most out of all of the characters. In fact, I believe that she's much more developed than the ""main girl,"" Emilia, and is simply a superior character. The first few times that we see Rem, she humorously makes fun of Subaru with the assistance of her sister Ram. However as the story progresses, we get to learn so much more about Rem. I don't want to spoil any particular moments, but I will say that she has a badass yandere mode where she slaughters practically everything with her spiked mace in an epic fashion. Rem also develops feelings for Subaru, who she becomes admirably loyal to and saves numerous times, that lead to some really adorable moments between the two. Rem is also super cute and she just looks stunning, especially when she smiles. The sexy maid outfit is also a plus. Re:Zero really showcases a rare gem in Rem, who is the best anime character that I've seen in awhile.

Re:Zero also boasts a strong supporting cast. This group of characters includes the cute and sarcastic maid Ram, the adorable and magical loli Beatrice, and the utterly insane and slothful antagonist Betelgeuse. While obviously not as much as the lead cast, many of these characters receive adequate development and possess unique personality traits that make them more likable and entertaining to watch.

Enjoyment: 8.5/10

This show combines the best aspects of different genres to create something that is very entertaining to watch. It has fun characters and settings that kept me entertained. I was constantly on the edge of my seat in excitement hoping for Subaru to succeed and tensely waiting to see the repercussions of his failures. Cliffhangers were effectively used at the end of multiple episodes that left me craving more, though they were a bit excessive. While some episodes focused on dialogue and lacked any ""excitement,"" I still enjoyed watching them because they helped to flesh out the characters and gave me valuable insight on the characters' emotions, thoughts, etcetera. My main issue is that I feel like the anime peeked at around episode 18, and while the final portion of Re:Zero remained pretty good, it didn't quite reach the level of greatness that the mid episodes had. Nonetheless, this was definitely an entertaining anime from beginning to end.

Overall: 8.6/10

Re:Zero impressed me. This anime wasn't afraid to take an overused idea and combine it with a myriad of originality that resulted in a very well produced show. While there are some minor errors (then again, what show doesn't have any flaws?), Re:Zero managed to succeed at being both an unique and a well executed anime. This is a show that I would most certainly recommend watching."

What I'm sick and tired of lately, which will probably never be stopped, is reviewers or fans comparing shows to other shows. It's a huge anime circlejerk that people are really adamant about. Honestly, it could be said about a lot of things. Video games are a very good example, but that's for another time.

Let's start off with my initial reaction. I usually pick a few shows to watch each season and continue from there. When I watched the trailer, I was immediately reminded of KonoSuba. It wasn't off putting, but I was just surprised to see an almost identical setting so soon. Of course, people are using 'isekai' as a description, but I never really heard of that until recently. Where a character gets transported into a world, etc...

I ended up only watching the first half of the hour long opening due to time constraints and it was kind of a ""whatever"" show to me. Big mistake. I took this for granted and ended up with friends on social media blabbering about the show weeks later. Around episode 14 or so.

I asked one of my good friends, who I'd actually say is pretty hardcore into anime (he's been using MAL for years and has a very strict rating guideline and watches almost every show that releases), what the concept of the show was. Remember, I didn't bother to look into this show at all. He basically just told me what happened at the end of the second half of the season premiere and I totally regretted my decision that night. I'm a sucker for that device- being able to start again or go into the past. I may have a bias on that genre (please don't look at my favorite shows... :) ), but this show executes it very well. I ended up binge watching until 15 and it was totally worth it. Since then, I've been trying to make the first thing I do every Sunday morning is watch Re:Zero.

Story: 10/10

Beginning with the story; it is wide and vast, but at its core a very deep, and emotional heart string puller. I'll say it here: I read a bit of the web novel a few weeks ago because my mind could not wait. I do like to spoil myself sometimes, but that's exactly what this show made me do. I did the same with Erased, and Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Because there was so much information I wanted to know that I feel like the show could not explain with a few episodes left. And albeit it is disheartening that they exclude some crucial information regarding characters or story, it does not take it away from the show at all. That's why I said it is wide and vast.

At initial glance, it seems as a very typical ""otaku/neet character gets transported into a different world..."" (as mentioned earlier), but it gives it a twist with strong character development along the way, which I will explain later. Being able to ""start again from zero"" is a common trend recently, but I honestly will never get tired of it. We all wish to be able to time travel or start things over, and it fills my need by watching these shows. This executes the concept incredibly well. It's hard to talk about the story without the characters, because they really are the backbone than the story rather than the lore of the world. 

The main protagonist is Natsuki Subaru, and it's very much his story. I hate him. I hate him a lot. Many people actually do, but it's not a bad thing. Why do we hate him? Because he makes horrible decisions and does things we do not want, at all. He is...very real. Many viewers and other anime fans like characters who have crazy magic powers, look super cool, wields some badass sort, or something along those lines.

There's nothing special about Subaru. He's definitely no Sora from No Game No Life. He also didn't have the luxury Kazuma Satou (KonoSuba) had being able take Aqua with him and join a guild/get a job.

We hate this guy. He's a crybaby and practically useless. However, that is what drives this show. We get to see him evolve into a better person. He treats his adventure like a game, and gets punished for it. We realize the struggle he goes through, and that is what we would go through if we were transported into a world like that. We play it off like a game that we see or know, but it's not a game, it's very real.

Subaru doesn't start off as some overpowered character that can trump the bad guys or continuously one-up them. He literally dies- over and over again. And he still doesn't learn his lesson until he deals with love. The love for Emilia. When it gets that deep, we're already attached. He'll do anything for her, and makes us feel the same way. Also, he doesn't automatically attract this ""harem"" that people seem to think he has. He earns it. He gave up blood and sanity to learn these people and they became a part of his life in this world.

For 25 episodes, we don't see the finish line straight ahead, but we wish we could see the course from above. Obstacles have been overcome, but there are a more to come, and some block in the roads as well.

Character: 9/10

There are many characters to love in this show, hell, Rem is already tons of people's waifu. What makes her that though? Her personality and determination is what all of us want, but not Subaru. She is everything to him, yet he stays faithful to Emilia. A lot of fans also have this as a reason to hate him; rejecting the perfect girl for someone who doesn't even feel the same way for him.

What is the fun if everything went the way you wanted? Of course- that's what we want in our heads, but not doing what we want creates tension, which is completely fine for this kind of genre. The last thing you want to think about is that it is a silly harem/comedy. It really isn't. It has twists, turns, loops, you shouldn't be wanting something, you should be wanting to know what direction is coming ahead.

Let's talk about the cast in general. It's great, just like I rated it. It's hard to find a perfect set, but they're close to being one. Everyone that gets air time, for the most part, has a developed background and importance in the show. They all mesh well together and have some sort of connection to Subaru. Characters that simply might be thought of ""side characters"", may have more than a meaning than you think. The feeling this show makes when Subaru gets so close to someone and have them dying off, and seeing them in a different timeline alive again is eerie as hell. You feel the realization that they were just dead- you became really close to them, and now you are back at the point where you just met them. There are some characters who get a decent amount, but are still unexplained in the show, but will be eventually...hopefully.

You want to look through the eyes of Subaru when looking at the cast, since this is his story. There are people you are going to hate and it's perfectly acceptable, because Subaru hates them as well. The same goes for being attached. That's why this is such a great cast. And People hating Subaru? That is fine too, because he shows that he truly hates himself throughout the entirety of the show. He wants to do better and you want him to do better, but keeps doing worse, and worse. He then realizes his faults, and so do we. When he develops, we develop.

People would say, why wouldn't he just do or say this? We need to realize that he portrays a neet or otaku and thinks it's a game. He thinks he can get away with what he knows about that culture, but is completely wrong. His method and thinking is not the same as ours watching. Being there is entirely different and that's the way he went through with it. He thinks he's Kirito, but obviously he's just a random neet stuck in a fantasy world. He doesn't have good social skills. He's awkward and cringey.

But his willingness to learn and his determination he promised since episode 1 is what makes him strong. He does get it over his head, way over his head, but he learns and realizes his mistakes, which makes him an amazing character. Not many characters these days accept their faults and mistakes. They're just already the best person in the universe and can overcome anything. We see why Subaru is able to do that in the end.

I can go over the other main characters or lead support characters just as much as Subaru, but I'm just going to shorten it here and say that Emilia is the X-Factor of the show. She pretty much preemptively decided Subaru's fate. I mean, she IS the main female protagonist. Rem and Ram help build his character, and I say this in the least descriptive way possible to keep this review shorter so I don't bore you with reading. They are the main support characters. And to make it generic, they support him pretty damn well.

The other characters, they beat him up (both mentally and physically), but he learns and builds from it. Every character he has a moment with is important to him. He learns to use his past knowledge about people to help him get through the world. They're not just people to him. As mentioned, at first, he completely naive, and we hate it, but we should stay in our seat and watch as his flaws become traits.

Art 8/10

No need to get into too much detail about this. The design and visuals great, but the random CG background characters really take it away from me to be honest. Like especially when there are drawn background characters mixed in with CG background characters.

The character designs aren't anything to be in awe about. I mean, Subaru is in a track suit for Christ's sake. Emilia's outfit is cute, Rem and Ram are just in kind of skimpy maid outfits. I do like the outfits the knights have.

The settings and locations are incredible though, like the city, mansion, forest, and open fields. Great variety colors. I'm not too keen on art, but in the end, it's all great except the super obvious CG.

Sound: 10/10

The background, fighting, and setting music aren't really memorable to me, but they're not bad whatsoever. There wasn't a time where I felt as if the music was off or anything, so it was just fitting.

However, the openings and endings I really enjoyed. At first I thought the second opening song was a little odd, but it really grew on me and I actually ended up wanting to watch the opening every time it came on, so that's good new. Myth & Roid is cool.

The second ending is fantastic. Like, when the episode would end and that song would play without the actual ending being played. It's kind of a slow and sad sounding song, so during intense moments it really brought out my emotions even more.

The voice acting, oh let me get started on the voice acting. So there's this bad guy named Petelgeuse/Betelgeuse. Just look up some clip and try to guess who the voice actor without looking him up.

-Yeah, it's Matsuoka. The guy who voices Sora, Soma, and Kirito. He does an AMAZING job differentiating his normal tone and voice. Even Subaru's voice actor does a breathtaking job. You can feel the anger, angst, and struggle with his voice. He's portraying an insane villain and has some crazy lines and phrases that are unforgettable. 

Enjoyment: 10/10

Uh, maybe by this review and its score you can tell if I enjoyed it or not. :) I binged this show like 15 episodes straight and was wanting more every week. I could probably say I enjoyed it, a little. It's a ride that I want to keep staying on. Ups, downs, loops, turns, jumps, you name it.

Overall: 10/10

With the individual scores, it comes to about a 95%, which I rounded up to a 10/10. So in actuality, this show is a 9.5. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

However, the only thing I would have to say is that I'd only recommend this show for people who have already watched a few shows already. I wouldn't say it's a good first show to watch if you're just new into anime, as good as it is. You kind of need to have background knowledge of other shows. Even though I say not to compare, but to just be aware and see the difference it really has to other shows, or that it takes in different aspects and genres to create this wonderful show.

Thanks for reading guys."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Not Recommended,"Ahh, the reviewer. The first line of defense to quell the flames of irrational thought and often the bearer of bad news for those of the general public. They're the Buzz Killingtons that take it upon themselves to blow the ""no fun"" whistle and send the partygoers back on the hype-train that they rode in on. It's a thankless job, one that doesn't reward anyone besides the smug satisfaction of the man with the whistle, tipping his top hat and waving ""adieu"" at the fanbase, outraged that someone had the audacity to bring an analytical lens to the ""totally bitchin party, bruh!""
And as the seasonal
                  ...
lineup ends and the hype-train chugs on to the next destination to start the cycle all over again, the reviewer, Mr. Buzz Killington, slaps his final verdict in the form of a nasty wall of diatribes, as he carries on his endless crusade to educate would-be viewers, one party foul at a time. 

Now, before I go any further, I'd like to put all my chips on the table. I don't plan to campaign for Re:Zero's public standing, nor will I bastardize its name for the sake of winning the appeal of dissenters. What will be written from here on out is simply one man stating his viewpoint. If that means dispensing the full-range of my vocabulary like a snobby know-it-all, then so be it. As long as my assessment is clearly understood, whether you choose to sling mud at my remarks or practice diplomacy is of no concern to me. 

And without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, weeaboos and pseudo-elites, I, ZephSilver, will serve as your Buzz Killington for the evening, as we take a tour through anime's latest mistake, Re:Zero, or as I like to call it, Re:packaged goods. 

Writhing in pain it doesn't understand, with paint-by-number personalities that desperately try to express it, Re:Zero is a gaudy, yet entertaining, blowhard that stumbles upon an ingenious formula for mainstream success. In a cynically calculated ruse, Re:Zero combines snippets of set-pieces from other works to create a Frankenstein that's built to be a surefire hit, regardless of how much manipulation is required to keep the circus act up. By capitalizing on the ever-increasing demand for MMORPG inspired settings, time-travel narratives and well... a gratuitous amount of shock value, it captures the general populace's attention with ease. And really, who could fault it? The anime industry has within its grasp a foolproof method to gain the public's ear. A method that's figured out, down to a science, thanks to countless trial and error. It just so happens that this 'foolproof' method is predicated on sales and popularity, whether it receives critical acclaim or not is secondary. Dangling its bait right after the success of works with similar setups, it was inevitable that many would bite. Re:Zero offered many fan-favorite arrangements all in a convenient, one-stop package: a smorgasbord of goodies to satisfy a wide range of palates. And if that wasn't enough to seal the deal, it marketed a premise that potentially subverted the MMORPG formula into something dark and decrepit, capturing any stragglers that might have avoided the bait in disinterest with the promise of something ""re:freshing.""

The rest was simply a matter of word of mouth. The match was lit, and all that was left was to sit back and watch the wildfire burn. With viewers exalting Re:Zero as ""smart,"" ""bold,"" and ""enthralling,"" ignoring this show's existence became nigh impossible. An anime that was built to be popular. An anime that was predestined to become the centerpiece discussion of every anime-related thread during its run. A wonderful monstrosity concocted in a lab by a board of executives, perfecting their latest endeavor to siphon money out of people's pockets, without so much as making the intent noticeable. I know we all want to hold an optimistic view on this situation but I advise that we take a step back before purchasing the snake oil. 

Re:Zero is to White Fox what Kabaneri was to Wit studio: a proven investment, disingenuous or not. 

Seriously, think about it for a moment. What were White Fox's most successful outings so far? Akame Ga Kill, a show about gruesome deaths in a medieval fantasy world, riddled with the underpinnings of political intrigue, a setup that deviated from typical shounen fodder, and a broad range of colorful personalities that inhabited its universe. And Steins;Gate, a show about time-travel being used to save your loved ones after a conspiracy was discovered, forcing the protagonist to revisit key events to find the best path to save everyone. Putting aside how you may feel about those shows individually, the fact remains that Re:Zero meshes these two appeals in a fashion that seems far too perfect to be simply a case of coincidence.
When you look back at the shows that garnered the most attention in the last handful of years, how could you not feel that Re:Zero is a product of the machine? There's being at the right place at the right time, and then there's simply casting your fishing line after analytical charts and focus groups indicate that the waters are ripe with hungry prey.

So after stating all this, it may surprise you to know that I fully recommend this show to anyone that confronts me about it. Why may you ask? Well, to be honest, it's pretty entertaining. Whatever my stance may be regarding the title, it cannot be denied that the show is easily digestible. With plot twists at every turn, bloody fatalities being dished out at a moments notice, and cliffhangers guaranteeing your return for more, Re:Zero is a binge-worthy viewing experience. However, my reasons for full-heartedly endorsing the show are probably not the reasons that the creators would probably like. For now, just hold on to that thought, we'll discuss why later.

And with that long-winded preface out of the way, it's time to continue our tour. 

Stepping out of a convenience store in modern day Japan and being transported to a medieval fantasy world for no more reason than the writers saying, ""We need to start the story somehow,"" our main protagonist, Suburu, enters Capital City; the epicenter of commerce for this foreign land of Lugunica and the place that would mark his burial ground on several occasions to come. After he comes in contact with a mysterious silver-haired girl named Emilia, he finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, hidden mysteries behind every corner and a bad case of groundhogs day that's marked with the end of his life. 

And so goes the rest of his journey, constantly being respawned at key locations similar to game save checkpoints until he conquers a life-threatening obstacle. Death, birth, repeat. A rat churning cream to avoid drowning and hoping its efforts would create butter, allowing for solid ground to escape its entrapment. Some might refer to this as ""torture porn"" or a snuff film in animated form. And while I might find these sentiments to be a bit overstated, I still can't help but feel like there's an underlying truth to that way of thinking. 
There's always a feeling that gnaws away at your subconscious when you watch the show. Something that many viewers may not be able to pinpoint but that they know is there, like the nuisance of a small object stuck in the sole of your shoe or a lingering thought that's just out of reach. I believe this feeling derives from the way the show presents its ideas. Themes that are supposed to be profound but end up taking on a whole new meaning when highlighted in neon lights and announced over a loudspeaker. 

Suburu doesn't just die; he's butchered in the most gratuitous way imaginable. A newly gained tactical advantage isn't just implemented; instead, it's buffered through excessive expository dialogue. Character arcs don't just happen naturally; they're highlighted with drastic presentation changes and streams of confetti. In the words of Urban Dictionary, Re:Zero has no chill. 

Re:Zero falls victim to sensationalizing things that it thinks would be considered poignant, as is the case with most shows that are said to 'subvert' the formula they're a part of. And by doing so, it indirectly counteracts that notion. A narcissistic protagonist being humbled by the realization that life doesn't revolve around him isn't a great revelation if the show goes out of its way to constantly point it out. Being mentally exhausted from the toll of dying constantly isn't eye-opening if the show literally has to tell you it is. Subtext ceases to hold meaning if the creators have a habit of making its intent obvious. This is the problem that many high-strung shows have, where they don't trust the viewer to pick up on the clues themselves. 2001: A Space Odyssey wouldn't be praised as a sci-fi classic if it had its ideas being pointed out with Blue's Clues paw prints. Se7en wouldn't be a great mystery/thriller had Dora the Explorer show up as a movie guide. Point being, good subtextual content is only good if the creators don't over-extend their control over how easy it's discovered. 

Like Erased from winter 2016, Re:Zero's attempts at something far beyond it only backfires when this issue plagues every facet of its existence. It's trying to be symbolic; it's trying to interweave motifs; it's trying to create intrigue; it's trying to tinker with psychology... but, it's doing so in the most ham-fisted way possible. It fully rejects the idea of subtlety in every aspect imaginable, instead choosing to holler everything in an ostentatious display that's borderline masturbatory. A premature celebration of its accomplishments that's mired in the stench of hubris. 

Setting tone and forcing tone aren't the same things. You can't give birth to natural reactions by simply pumping your content full of steroids to make it blossom faster. Anything worth having should come to fruition on its own merits through the course of the narrative. Re:Zero is simply too impatient for proper grooming, and as a result, we get villains that are essentially godforsaken hybrids of the Joker, Batman V Superman's Lex Luther, and the wacky waving inflatable tube men located outside of used car dealerships, snacking on their fingers like crispy chicken tenders. We get characters that deviate from common anime tropes to simply fall victim to yet another trope instead. Re:Zero's biggest enemy is itself, a show that can't be subdued even if it comes at the cost of its own integrity. 
But what about the people that don't see these issues? What about those who are genuinely enthralled by Re:Zero's efforts? Those who, despite the obvious blare of ‚Äòtrying-too-hard‚Äô fireworks, don't pick up on the show's underlying meaning until further inspection? What about the people who push the agenda of the show being ""smart,"" ""bold,"" and ""enthralling?"" The foot soldiers that perpetuate the show's self-worth, finding depth where others see beyond it? Surely they're not mistaken. What do they see that others don't? As it turns out, the real question isn't what they see, but what they choose to give the show credit for. 

It's the interesting themes that Re:Zero flirts with throughout its narrative. The outer shell that masquerades as in-depth concepts. If there's no prior contact with the ideas that Re:Zero presents, this kind of perception is easy to understand. First exposure to something that insinuates a deeper layer could cause any viewer to wax philosophical. And there lies the difference: those that have seen the laminated copy, as well as the genuine article. When the same concepts are seen done right, suddenly that laminated copy starts to become all the more noticeable. And so is the case with Suburu's supposedly ""broken psyche.""

Like the case for Gakkougurashi of summer 2015, another show proclaimed as a 'deconstruction' of its genre, Re:Zero also takes pleasure in tinkering with delirium, but refuses to dive truly into it. It glorifies the main character's mental breakdown, turning it on and off at the whims of the scriptwriters. With something as easy as a pep talk and hug from LoveInterest#2 being all that's needed to make things better, it's really hard to justify the ""psychology"" that Re:Zero boasts about.

Want to truly show a mentally broken state? Then have the line between past existence and current life be obscured with each reincarnation, and don't fix it. Just imagine how amazing it would be if the memories of all respawned events were compressed upon each rebirth, to the point where Suburu is no longer aware of the difference between them. It would truly demonstrate the anguish that Suburu suffers through by making the consequence something that's not only visual for the viewer but also something that implies that deeper layer that the show so desperately seeks to obtain. Instead of simply being the laminated copy, it could have been like other animated works that truly dive deep into this concept, such as Satoshi Kon's Millennium Actress and Perfect Blue. Both featured films containing women who slowly lose their minds and grips on reality as they descend further into a fever dream of delirium and jumbled memory. It didn't just carry around psychology like some fashion accessory, but it made it a very real thing for the viewers looking on and the characters that took the plunge into the never-ending spiral of irrational flatlining. 
See that the protagonist suffers a loss that he can't simply fix with a jump off a cliff. Have stakes. If respawning to checkpoints is the only way to advance the narrative, the very least the creators could do would be to place Suburu at the crossroad of a decision that would allow advancement only if someone else were to perish. Let there be permanent blood on his hands, not just a never-ending clean slate. Don't resolve psychological trauma like it's just some phase people get over after a few days. Don't just wave around psychology like it's a toy. People don't simply undo damage because the plot demands a rational mind in a given scenario. This shouldn't change even for Suburu. Embrace it fully. Let go of safety nets if you truly want something that's ""deep"" and not just another copy of something other creators (Satoshi Kon) have proven is possible to achieve. 

And really, this is just covering one aspect the show chooses to claim as its own. The same level of commitment is expected for every aspect of Re:Zero, not just some half-assed effort. With these nebulous concepts about redefining a protagonist's importance and exposing inner truths that felt entirely too heady for something as simple-minded as Re:Zero to muster up in any meaningful way, the only chance that the other half that doesn't see the show as ""smart,"" ""bold,"" and ""enthralling"" could buy into it, is if the show stops trying to find compromise that's easy to live with. It may seem ""smart,"" but it does so with an air of smarminess while also over-pronouncing its efforts. It may seem ""bold,"" but it never takes any risks that could be seen as irreversible. It may seem ""enthralling"" for advocates, but for everyone else on the other side of the aisle, it's just dumb schlock-entertainment.

And if there was anything that made this half-ass commitment more apparent, it would have to be the presentation that it was given. 

Re:Zero is that kid that just learned a new 3-syllable word and just spews it out at every opportune moment in a sad attempt to appear intellectual. There're some elements here that demonstrate some semblance of writing chops, I would give the show that, but the way the writers flaunt their ability to come up with said ideas comes off as conceited, especially when these moments wallow in content that's tantamount to idiotic orchestral displays. It's a proud peacock, flaunting its ideas, while strutting around with toilet paper stuck to its ass. As it navel-gazes, everyone else looks on in amusement. 

When I said it points things out with neon lights, this is what I mean. 

‚ÄúHey, the camera is shaking excessively. Hey, we're giving Suburu a manic expression, one step away from having him foaming at the mouth. Hey, we literally added a 10% darkness opacity filter to Suburu's color scheme. Hey, all of these scene compositions literally bathe Suburu in a constant shadow. Hey, his eyes are big and bulgy. HEY, HEY, HEY!! Do you get it yet!? Hey, are our actions to paint him in an obscure light after a big altercation with Emilia not made clear yet? Please reward us. Please tell us we're smart. I learned a 3-syllable word today! Please applaud my efforts!‚Äù

Evil can't be expressed without outlandishly warped expressions. Happiness can't be felt without copious amounts of animated tears, a gust of wind, and painted on blushes. Insanity can't be expressed without darkened eye bags, manic expressions, and rape faces. Everything is calculated. A stage play executed with no blemishes. A play that remains a play. Art that imitates the art of others. Re:Zero wants to be a real boy, but its growing wooden nose tells the truth it doesn't want to admit to itself. If the warped face of anger looks forced, then guess what: it's forced. If the happy moments felt a bit too inflated with random rose peddles flying around and kawaii-level faces, then guess what: it's inflated. If sadness felt unauthentic with instantaneous waterworks and elastic expressions at the drop of a hat, then guess what: it's unauthentic. You're not interpreting it wrong. That pang in the back of your head that tells you this is kinda overkill isn't ""just you."" Deep down you know what you're seeing is over exaggerated, and after time has settled and you reminisce about key events, that would become clearer than ever. Re:Zero is a novelty act that blinds you with flurries of action and plot twists, but the moments the spectacle is over, what would remain is the realization that what you held dear was nothing more than snake oil sold by a quick-witted businessman. 

Even things like auditory cues can't help but feel like the show signaling excessively to get your attention, an example being a high pitched hum, like angelic beings from a choir taking a laxative-laced shit. It could be seen as ""chilling"" to some, or you could be like me and think it's the angels of heaven passing a kidney stone in orchestic unison. Point being it's played only to signal a disturbance. And seeing that the show is all about disturbances, it just ends up exacerbating a problem that didn't need any more highlighting than it was already getting. 

What needed more attention, however, were the characters and environment that the story took place in. For a show that's supposed to be genre defining, it does very little to prove it. 

We get characters whose defining personality trait is being a loli with a speaking habit, I suppose. Beatrice and the rest of the loli cast could fuck off, I suppose. But I suppose since half of Re:Zero's main cast is lolis, getting rid of them would leave very little, I suppose. Stereotypical roles don't suddenly become better by simply switching them to another stereotypical role. A visual novel maid character doesn't gain depth by making her ‚Äúwaifu-bait‚Äù contestants. And this extends to every other character Suburu comes across on his journey. They're all just there to fill in expected roles, like a bunch of NPCs that are brought to life.

There's no sense of culture. No ethos to pull from. Nothing that defines the world that Suburu is tossed into. Just snippets of ideas cobbled together to serve as yet another medieval fantasy world that draws from the same well as any other. Were Re:Zero the only anime to tackle high fantasy, this wouldn't be a problem, but sadly for it, Escaflowne exists. Rage of the Bahamut exists. Berserk(1997) exists. Moribito exists. There's nothing here that defines Re:Zero. Even trainwrecks like Akame Ga Kill had a better-thought-out universe. And for whatever it does try to establish, it's either extremely overbearing or missing things that could be attributed to half-assed resolve. To go into specific cases would require spoiling some events, so join me in the spoiler section to go over them if you've already seen the show. As for everyone else, skip past for final thoughts. 

**** brief spoilers****
(scroll down to avoid)

Naita Aka Oni (The Red Ogre who Cried), is a popular Japanese children tale that teaches kids the cost of assimilation and what it means for loved ones left behind to gain it. This is shown with a red and a blue ogre. Re:Zero attempted to use this story to insinuate the relationship shared between Ram and Rem. But like everything else that the show highlights unnecessarily, this parallel drawn was also made blatantly obvious, with Ram and Rem's hair color being pink and blue, which obviously alluded to the red and blue ogres, respectively. This wouldn't have been a big deal had they kept it at just that, but like I've already stated, the show doesn't trust its audience to pick up on the subtext implied. Instead, we get the arc with the inclusion of both sisters being superimposed with a symmetrical balance of pink and blue at every turn. It beats you over the head with the symbolism it's trying to present. This also included Suburu stating to the sisters that they're ‚Äúfanatical like demons‚Äù with their reactions indicative to their origin as literal demons. It's this kind of obviousness that shows like Erased demonstrate when they highlighted everything in red to insinuate danger. Attempts at cleverness that's just painfully juvenile. And now this same kind of forcefulness is being carried over to Re:Zero. 

And 17-minutes into episode 11, Suburu states, ""You know, Rem, you keep putting Ram on a pedestal and undermining yourself‚Äî,"" while the camera unapologetically focuses on blue and pink flowers, both literally sitting in a vase (pedestal) of equal height. These are the kinds of things that Re:Zero does repeatedly that demonstrate its lack of restraint. Constantly drawing attention to your symbolism only defeats the purpose of it, to begin with. Symbolism and motifs alike are supposed to be discovered, not spoon-fed. And this is the problem with this show: it can't simply let things be without intervening with forceful resolve. 

And then you have ideas that are used only to add detail to the universe or serve as a new plot reveal to keep the story exciting, but that are never properly thought out. 

Like the battle against Moby Dick, a beast with the ability to erase the memory of people's existence consumed by its fog. We get an example of this when Rem sacrifices herself to save Suburu and is immediately forgotten by everyone who knows her. But yet, when this incident occurs again during the heat of battle against a battalion in episode 20, the powers don't work the same way. Where in the case of Rem her very presence and existence was erased, in this battle, soldiers only forgot the names of the soldiers lost in the mist but are still aware of the fact that people are missing. So how do people remember a whole platoon going missing during battle when they're consumed when prior cases of the whale's mist made it clear that you wouldn't even be aware of the lack of anything missing? This is just one of many small plotting issues littered across the show, and the only conclusion is that the creator needed another plot twist to hook viewers in, but fell victim to a plot hole later on when it no longer served a purpose.

Suburu is said to smell like the witch to a few people, yet, from all accounts, no one has ever encountered the witch face to face, so how do they know this assessment to be accurate? So the statement:
""Do I smell like the witch?""
is no better than saying:
""Do I smell like the thing you've never seen or come in contact with in your life?""

The entire show is just built on one unanswered question after another. How did he arrive in this world? How does his respawning ability work like a save point? In episode 24, he was shown to restart after getting past the whale and into the mansion, but then he could conveniently go back to the point where he defeated the whale as a save point after he dies at the village? It's obvious that this was done only to bypass having to reset the progression he made with Rem in episode 18. A moment where the show bends its own rules by going beyond simple retconning, instead, rewriting the very nature in which the resets work. 

How could he speak their language and be understood but not write their assigned text? It's minor things like this that demonstrated that they wanted to appear insightful, but in actuality had only half-baked ideas‚Ä¶ half-baked ideas that gave way to a show riddled with plot inconsistencies. 

And then there're just scenes that are supposed to be tragic but just come across as ludicrous. Episode 15 contains the biggest culprit that comes to mind. This is where we met joker-inflatable-tube-man, who proceeded to break Rem's neck and limbs, and yet, somehow, she crawls over to Suburu and uses magic to free him‚Ä¶ and this is supposed to be tragic? Nothing about this moment makes any sense whatsoever. And to top it off, it also demonstrates a moment where the writers switch Suburu's mental breakdown on and off whenever it suits the story. This isn't some ""deep"" moment; it's bullshit. 

Re:Zero doesn't know the difference between mental anguish and parading characters around for personal amusement, nor does it understand that tossing ideas and lifting entire passages from other folktales don't mean it would work as a cohesive piece. There's a reason there's no cohesiveness between arcs; all it does is pattern storylines from works that proceeded it. A fairy tale whose identity can't exist without leaching off of others, and whose attempts at something different result in the aforementioned problems. 


*******end of spoilers*******


When Hayao Miyazaki said that people ""don't spend time watching real people"" with industry, in-house anime creators being ""humans who can't stand looking at other humans,‚Äù this is what he's referring to: shows that can't find inspiration outside of their own anime tropes because the people working on them don't see anything beyond anime. Re:Zero is a self-indulging anime with no worldly influence to speak of. Shinichir≈ç Watanabe, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Yoko Kanno. What made these industry giants well-known was their ability to draw inspiration from influences outside of anime. They brought something new to the table, a claim that shows like Re:Zero can't prove. It's a product of its environment. Anime feeding into anime. It's Ouroboros incarnate. 

Remember that thought I told you to hold on to, as to why I still suggest this show, regardless of how I feel about it? Well, this is the reason why. This is what it all boils down to. Re:Zero is an embarrassingly pompous try-hard that's fun to gawk at. It's a show that has proven to be a source of entertainment for those unconcerned with the finer details and who simply want to be amused for 20-minute intervals, as well as a comical mess for those who do see beyond the smoke and mirrors and enjoy dissecting silly shows for purposes of discussion. It's a show that takes itself dead serious while being oblivious to the fact that it's anything but. It's the Elfen Lied, the Mirai Nikki, the Akame Ga Kill, the [insert your own example here] of 2016. A show that could appeal to everyone, regardless of how they view their entertainment or how much thought they place into the pixelated images flooding their peripheral. It's the ""M. Night Shyamalan"" of animated works, a name big enough to fill in seats on opening night, but consistently funny enough for critical thinkers to jump in knowing they'll experience something amusing, even if unintentional.

Everyone wins. The studio heads make their profit; the majority get to be entertained, and the critics get a new punching bag for their inner circles. The world needs titles like Re:Zero. Titles that everyone will see. Cynical cash grabs will always come and go, but if I'm given a choice in the matter, I at least want my price of admission to be a show that's still entertaining. And with Re:Zero, that's what I got, a good ole dumb time. 

Re:Zero is a great show if you don't care for subtlety, think 2-D waifus are laifu and are impressed by characters emoting in boisterous ways. But in terms of actual quality, this is an anime that puffs its chest out, holding its breath for as long as it can, with the slightest release exposing it for what it truly is: hot air. 

I could count on one hand the number of shows I've ever used the forbidden ""pretentious"" word on without so much as second guessing my stance and I would unequivocally state here and now that Re:Zero became one of them. A show that strong-armed me into using a buzzword that I promised myself I would use only as a final ultimatum. And in a way, I guess that could be seen as an achievement. So congratulations Re:Zero, a show where only the cheapest blow every self-respecting critic dare not to resort to, could be the only appropriate response left available. But in this case, it's worth it. No other shows I've seen in recent years deserve the rare honor more than this. Take the mantle Re:Zero. You‚Äôve officially become the most conceited MMORPG-inspired anime to date.

Re:Zero is spray-on tan psychology with peel-off sticker-tattoo themes. It's the kid on internet forums who are constantly saying ""90's Baby,"" with a 1999 birth certificate. Its out-of-touch executives googling anime-related search results in an attempt to assure their product is ""totally dope.‚Äù It's an anime that's rallied in on a stage sponsored by corporate suits, with ""best waifu"" pillows and other merchandise already pre-made upon launch date. Re:Zero is shallow, plain and simple. A skim off the surface of whatever topical events stick their noses out far enough to be noticed by those too busy counting the zeros in their bank account to dig any deeper. 

But you know what? That's fine. I watched it, laughed and had a good time. And if people could cherish the laminated copy with the same vigor that others do the genuine article, who am I to stop them? Shows like Re:Zero will always come and go; you could either fight it or say ""fuck it"" and simply kick back and enjoy the nonsense on screen."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Imagine a show that repackages some of the most recurring themes in anime today and make it into a fantasy thriller. That‚Äôs what Re:Zero essentially is. Adapted from the novels of the same name, the show is more of a darker fantasy story than most people may be familiar with. It‚Äôs not exactly like a show where a character is stuck in a world and they try to find a way out. Or is it making a parody of the show itself. Rather, Re:Zero (Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu) is a fantasy thriller that has some delirious complexity.

Early impressions of Re:Zero may trigger viewers‚Äô comparison
                  ...
to series such Steins;Gate, Erased, or even the live-action movie, Edge of Tomorrow. What do all these have in similarity? It‚Äôs the idea of time travel. The ability to loop back from the present to the past is a fictional theme we‚Äôve all heard of before. It‚Äôs nothing new and Re:Zero essentially portrays that with Subaru, the main male protagonist and his reset ability. The ability ‚ÄúReturns by Death‚Äù allows return to a ‚Äúsave point‚Äù after death with all memories intact of the original user. Basically, Subaru gets a chance to fix mistakes so that consequences can be avoided. The key word here is ‚Äòchance‚Äô as it‚Äôs not always guaranteed that Subaru can change the future. By adapting this idea, Re:Zero‚Äôs early plot developments shows how Subaru uses his ability to make a difference while trying to live his new life in this unfamiliar world.

From that world, we meet a variety of characters. One of the most recognizable character in the show is Emilia, a half-elf who has a mysterious origin. Her identity is similar to another infamous character in the series so others sometimes mistaken her for that. In the meantime, Emilia is a friendly girl although can be commanding and sometimes childish. The relationship between her and Subaru is important as they grow to understand more of each other. One of the important dynamics about their relationship is that Subaru acknowledges her as a good person. This feeling coupled with Emilia‚Äôs growing trust of Subaru establishes a bond between the two. Two other characters in the series (Rem and Ram) are also introduced whom Subaru gets acquainted with. In the later stages of the series, Rem shows obvious feelings towards Subaru that grows into love. Similar to Emilia, Subaru acknowledges Rem despite her shady past. And because of that, Rem grows to care Subaru as one of her closest friends.

It‚Äôs hard to really ignore the relationship principles of the show. Subaru forges many important relationships including a contractor, a female knight, and even a guy that once humiliated him in front of everyone. From the get-go, Subaru really isn‚Äôt a guy that is afraid to take risks. This sometimes leads to irrational decisions with disastrous consequences but he is also able to learn from his mistakes. In addition, Subaru is an idealist and firmly loyal to those he cares about. He is also clever and uses trickery (possibly from his real life skills) to get what he wants. On paper, Subaru is generally portrayed as a kind man but not afraid to show his tough side either. In essence, Subaru is the most ‚Äúhuman‚Äù character in the show. He makes mistakes like humans do and tries to correct them. What I do find irritating about Subaru though is what motivates him for his decisions. This can also lead to other fans of certain characters they‚Äôve grown attached to. Because let‚Äôs face it, Subaru has flaws and the writing of the series shows those flaws.

On the other hand, Emilia is a character that I find less appealing. Quite frankly, we just don‚Äôt know her enough and it‚Äôs hard to understand her in general. Her relationship with Puck and the other characters aren‚Äôt fully explored. Furthermore, her personality is hard to get attached to even as they are shown from pieces to pieces. To be honest, the female character that stands out the most in the show would be Rem. She has a background story that is explored including with her twin sister, Ram. The relationship development between her and Subaru is quite memorable as they risk their lives for each other. And furthermore, Rem has her own reasons to help others (in particular Subaru) that viewers will easily understand. Anyway, I think the point I‚Äôm trying to make is that between some characters, some just stand out than others. For instance, a breakout character in the show would be Wilheim as we learn in depth of his motivations to fight a giant whale. On the other hand, there are other characters that is just plain replusive such as Petelgeuse from the Witch‚Äôs Cult. 

Despite the dark fantasy style of Re:Zero, the show still remains lighthearted on many occasions. As a light novel adaptation, you‚Äôll probably find many standard tropes ranging from the generic jealousy of certain girls to childish antics of Beatrice. Subaru also tends to make himself look like a fool in front of others which can be irritating to watch. Still, the comedy of the show on most occasions is properly timed to balance out the darker themes. The fan service comes mostly from violence rather than the skin. In retrospect, Re:Zero deconstructs its fantasy themes and twist them into a darker direction. From an adaptation perspective, the show is faithful to adapt some of the most important elements. However, the series is considered incomplete as there are certain plot elements that are unresolved. The way the director adapted the series seems to focus as much as content from the source as possible while keeping the story credible and on point. 

White Fox adapts the animation style and Re:Zero is mostly well crafted. The character designs gives the feel like they are from a fantasy world. Characters such as Emilia, Beatrice, the twin sisters, Felt, etc has their own unique presence. The monsters in the series such as the White Whale and Mabeasts also look intimidating. In fact, the Re:Zero world is something you‚Äôll find in any fantasy tale with the lustrous landscapes, dense forests, or medieval-like castles. As you probably know by now, the series has a lot of violence so expect characters such as Petelgeuse and Elsa to showcase that. Most of is censored as White Fox goes out in attempt to make it credible. However, it‚Äôs still perfect although I heard the BD/DVD releases will feature more violence.

If there‚Äôs also something else that deserves recognition, it would be the soundtrack. The thrilling OST portrays well for a show that has such an eerie feel. The heroic moments and climatic segments are also made memorable with the show‚Äôs instrumental choreography. OP and ED theme songs are well crafted with the talent of the singers and producers. In the meantime, I think character voice mannerism also deserves some praise especially for characters like Rem (who can express human emotions quite) and Puck. And while Petelgeuse is quite an unlikeable character, one has to admit that his voice stands out as a villain.

By the time you‚Äôve finished watching Re:Zero, you‚Äôre probably asking yourself if the journey is worth it. The deconstruction of a typical fantasy show is evident as each episode progresses. We get quite an adequate amount of characterization on the main cast. And many times, I think it‚Äôs easy to find yourself anticipating what may happen next with the numerous cliffhangers the show offers. Indeed, Re:Zero is less of a ‚Äòtrapped in game‚Äô style story but more of a fantasy thriller. Every episode offers something the fans will hunger for. And if that‚Äôs not enough, then you‚Äôre watching it wrong."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"A final review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 
(Re-updated; it may contain some spoilers, so be aware of it):

================================

""If you are suddenly summoned to another fantasy world without any kind of preparation, what will you do?"" 

Some of the reactions of other people is that some of them would really panic and do not know what to do... but on Subaru's case (the main character of the story), he is 'trying' to rationalize his situation even though he experienced different kinds of despair and other negative emotions about his current situation and trying to adapt to his new environment. At first, he is trying
                  ...
to stabilize his mental state and too desperate about what will happened on his situation. After that, he gradually gained some information about his current situation. On the later scenes, he met this beautiful elf girl named Emilia who saved him on a unexpected pinch situation; more like a boy-meets-girl situation, and then... the wicked-like fantasy adventure of Subaru begins and how the lives of other important people who he met throughout the story that could affect his decision-making on his unfortunate situation. How can he survive?

This show, Re:Zero is one of the most interesting anime shows premiered on Spring 2016 that exemplifies the life of a certain boy named Subaru in a fantasy world and how he could adapt to his new environment. It would surely enjoy most of the viewers who like fantasy-themed or 'isekai-themed' anime shows to watch this kind of show because it seems 'not usual' to other similar-themed anime shows; it is filled with action, comedy, drama, and some thrilling and unexpected time-traveling and dark-themed scenarios... Wait... Time-traveling? Dark-themed?! How is it possible? Well, he noticed that he can not use any kind of magical powers but later on, he realized that he gained an ability called 'returns by death' when he was on a pinch situation. As the skill name itself, he can go back to a certain time and place where he could start again his adventure. Later on, he discovered that he has this kind of 'shadow(?)' magical attribute. Those mysterious ability and magical attribute are really helpful in his situation but also somewhat makes his situation more complicated or pain-in-the-ass because of its 'unknown(?)' origin. At first, the story-line seems confusing, depending on the viewer's perspective but it really gives dark/mysterious-vibe and cliffhanger scenes which surely gives us viewers more hype and thrills in this show! Generally-speaking, this anime is not the best but it is definitely one of the most interesting shows of Spring 2016!

Moving on, the multimedia and other aspects of this anime show are good, specially the character designs that really emphasized the unique traits of each characters in the story. If you know about the animation studio called White Fox (the animation studio of this anime show), it would really show that it has similarities on their animation style and forte on making their own style. If you know those similar anime shows they created, it would really increase the impact towards the entertainment of the show. In my opinion, there are some quality flaws in other animation stuffs like CGI and other designs on some episodes that are not really well-fitted or blended to the show. Nevertheless, those are not really a big negative factor to the show and does not really affect the quality and the development of the story-line. On the positive-side, I really like the animation stuffs like the point-of-view angles they emphasized on some scenarios on some episodes and it really follows the concept of the story. 

The opening & ending songs are so great and also fitted to the theme of the show (e.g. the lyrics and the style of the songs), which I also like in this anime show. I did not expect that pop punk-ish(?) OP theme song was performed by Konomi Suzuki, and I do not know what would be my reaction towards that since her usual J-pop anime song styles are really not like that. In my opinion, the new anisong artist MYTH & ROID's mysterious-and-futuristic-style J-pop theme songs of this anime is better in this anime show compared to Konomi Suzuki's opening song. In addition, there are no really obvious and noticeable errors on the multimedia aspects of the show like audio timing etc. The voice actors and actresses are also very talented that they really portray to their specific character roles. Some of them are newly popular with the anime fans like the CV of Emilia (Rie Takahashi) and the CV of Rem (Inori Minase), which can contribute more to the audience impact of the show. In addition to that, they also performed some of the OSTs, therefore it really shows their professionalism towards the show. The BGMs are really great and it and fitted to the action and other scenes of this show, which also mainly contribute to the impact of the show.

The storyline of this anime show is one of the greatest factor that mostly contributes to the impact of the show, including those amazing plot twists in every episode. Even though the story was rushed, I really like how this anime show would try to show some important plot contents from Re:Zero's light novel, which the animators/creator(s) of this anime really want us to fully enjoy the every 20-min episodes. The characters are also great because they provided great character designs that could somehow adds to the entertainment value of the show. Personally-speaking, the light novel is a 'must-read' to those fans who want to fully understand what Re:Zero's plot is all about.

In terms of the character traits, it was somewhat positively contributed to the audience impact on the show that later on, it creates that 'waifu' war between cute and loyal demon/maid girl named Rem the beautiful elf girl named Emilia or called EMT by Subaru and the fans. Furthermore, most of those characters have their unique lifestyles like the like Subaru who has really unique traits and 'realistic-like' personality compared to the other main characters out there; he is more vulnerable and has this kind of 'irrationalism' that makes him more 'human' compared to other common and overpowered main characters with god-like powers that were mostly existed on other popular anime shows, therefore it creates a different kind of twist to the story. The supporting characters like Rem & Ram, Puck, Beatrice, and other villain characters are also very important to the development of the story; they have their own character developments and big involvement throughout the story, therefore they are also somewhat popular to the audience. 

In terms of the show's entertainment value, some people would not really enjoy/appreciate the concept of 'moe' characters, un-emphasized development of other important characters because of limited time, some clich√© elements like the concept of 'isekai' or other world with fantasy setting, and the unusual main character's behavior that were integrated in Re:Zero's story. It is because it ruins the seriousness of the story or it somehow deviates the norms and concepts of an usual fantasy or other related genre to the theme of Re:Zero. Despite of that, it is still interesting because of its uniqueness and somehow entertaining to the viewers.

With all those double-eged critics/controversies/rumors we've heard, this show is very interesting and breath-taking in each episodes, which is a big proof that this anime show is one-of-the-best anime of Spring 2016.I really hope that this review would encourage someone who does not any or little idea about this show to watch this!

You will never expect what's coming if you just base your opinion on its premise or art style.

Moving on, if there is just one thing that I had to choose to say why Re:Zero stands among the best of the best, it is the realistic take on a fantasy world MC (Subaru)... and the character growth (read suffering) that he goes through. Some arcs were just plain depressing and disgusting to watch. How pathetic can the main character get? Well, that's where this anime outshines most others. This makes
                  ...
the final redemption arc all the more satisfying to watch. And it's not just Subaru, there's Rem! Right from her initial reaction to Subaru to the culmination of everything beautiful in episode 18, it was perfect. Same goes for Emilia. From the kinda uptight girl that saves Subaru in EP1 to the conclusive finale where she goes through an emotional release (in a good way), her character, while it didn't develop much, grew to be more open. I can keep on talking about the other characters, but I think Tappei (the author) did a wonderful job here. So characters? 10/10.

Animation - 9/10
Kudos to White Fox for doing such an amazing job. Lots of wallpaper worthy shots.

OST - 9/10
Again, White Fox did an amazing job here plugging in the songs at very appropriate times. Not a big fan of any of the OPs. But the endings, goddamn. Episode 18 stands out as one of the best use of a song ever ~ (Wishing by Rem). And that title drop gave me goosebumps.

Story - 10/10
Ever watched an anime that just the perfect mix of action, adventure, comedy, romance, mystery, drama, tragedy, etc? You haven't yet, if you have not watched Re:Zero. Right from the delightfully comedic interactions between Rem/Ram and Subaru at the start to Subaru's distressing and pitiful redemption arc, it was just so wholesome and complete. However, the story was not perfect. Some decisions the MC makes, make no sense whatsoever. But they can be overlooked when you think how good it integrates the different genres.

And finally, I'm going to add one more category for the rating - Community. 10/10.

Watching an anime episode after episode on the day it airs might be frustrating sometimes. But in the case of Re:Zero it just made the anime all the more enjoyable. Thanks mostly in part to r/anime, r/Re_Zero, twitter, MAL and also /a/. Having a community to share the meltdowns and good moments with, is something that cannot be put in words.

So, just go ahead and marvel in the glorious suffering anime that is Re:Zero, while I sit here wishing I can start this anime, again, from Zero.

Season 2, WHEN?"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Re: Zero was an anime that I thought wouldn't be very good. I started watching the episode expecting to be dissapointed that it would be a generic ""other world"" anime. I thought this up until the last scene were the main character is murdered. Soon afterward he ""respawns"" at a fruit stand in the market, this is what hooked me. I realized that this anime is doing something no anime has done before. It made me care about the characters, and even become sad when they died even though I knew it would just be reset when Subaru dies.

Story 10/10
The story wasn't just a love
                  ...
story, it was a journey of drama, loss, friendship, and enemies.

Art 10/10
The art was beautiful. I wasn't dissapointed with it at any point. It gave a great atmosphere for each situation and made sure you could take in each detail that was presented. 

Sound 9/10
The openings and endings both fit the anime very well. The music playing in the background set the atmosphere very well, but there wasn't very much variety.

Character 10/10
The characters were amazing. They all had some amount of importance and are built up so you care about them a certain amount. 

Enjoyment 10/10 
I was kept in the edge of my seat throughout the whole anime. There were times of calm between ""respawns"" that were used to build the characters, but that didn't take anything away from my enjoyment.

Overall 10/10
This anime wasn't prefect, no anime is. Any part that might've been disappointing was made up for the next episode."

Contain so many similar elements from several anime, adapted, and executed perfectly. Even with so many similar elements from different anime mixed there, Re: Zero is still very original series in a sense of taste.

There's been some kind of weird mocking to some of the heroine in this anime in several forums, and that's been driving people straight to disinterest with the series. I hope there's nothing like that happening again in the future. Re:Zero is a great series, and people shouldn't be so disinterested with it because of cancerous community.

There's some aspects that I love about this anime:

1)
                  ...
Main Protagonist's change of character.
People tend to hate a character with unsightly attitude in some event in anime or manga. But for me, it's something beautiful to see. It's stronger than seeing character that found new power. Some good character attitude development is really hard to pull since writer have to know, feel, or even experience some event that can trigger ones character. In this series, Subaru is one that have solid characteristic development in attitude.

2) Literally got one set of attractive Heroines.
I can't deny that I'm really attracted to Rem after watched Episode 18. Emotions flows like roller coaster from hate to love. I really like the strong toddler magician that stays in her mansion to keep it safe. There's less of Ram involvement in that series so I can't make out any good impression of her so far. And of course, Emilia is one charming main heroine, but I hope there's more of her if there's ever a 2nd season, cuz I still enchanted to Rem more than Emilia.

3) Interesting Story (of course it is but I just have to point it out)
There's been some anime that has same kind of setting where the main protagonist trapped or goes to another world or dimension, the main protagonist can go back in time to change things better, set in kind of a medieval time. But Re:Zero really meshed all of that into one beautiful romantic fantasy.

I really recommend this anime to you who loves series like Stein's Gate, Guilty Crown or GATE."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"This is quite though anime to give insights on. There are a lot of part from this anime that I really like, as much as parts that I didn't really like. But I did enjoy this anime a lot and it is worth for overall 9.

What I dislike:

- Story coming in and out without proper prologue and ending. Why Subaru got suddenly sent to the fantasy world, what is his relation with the Witch, and so on. It will be exciting turnouts if audience got explained those things. I am truly expecting a longer series instead of 25 episodes. Something like HxH where in the
                  ...
end (perhaps) Emilia became the Queen and Subaru getting strong and defeat the Witch which is in the he became the King. Nice End.

- Second! This is the one of the worst part is Subaru. Yes, for me his one of the worst main hero, he acting over-stupid & childish almost the entire series, not to mention he is weak af. He stayed too many episodes with that kinds of character and it really frustrating and exhausting to watch him doing stupid thing, acting irresponsibility, and helpless all the time. Seriously...when I start watching this anime I was REALLY expecting he is somehow awaken a specialised strong skill (other than keep on dying and repeat) but as the episodes gone one by one, he is truly not moving up in terms of strength (only got that stupid shumac). Although he did getting strong mentally, for Godsake...that was after die at least 3 times for the same events. I have seen a long anime series like HunterXHunter which is the character developed very well the entire series. They have up and down, but they are progressing in all kinds of way which Subaru doesn't have.

- Betelgeuse Romanee Conti. Really the most annoying antagonis in anime. He just simply a psychotic and to make it worst, he out-powered the main character (Subaru) by far. Seriously, why it so hard just to give him death. I prefer character like him die once and then Subaru met the witch. Conti really psychotic and an antagonis without charisma.

- Last! The series is again...TOO SHORT. I am really expecting for second season with a proper finishing episodes. Not hanging like this. When the story start we have TONS of characters introduced on each arch. Not to mention Felt! She is suddenly brought up from slump to the kingdom but then that's it. She doesn't make any difference in the story at all in the end. It will be nice also that each candidate have their own arch story (just like Wilhem got for himself, his romance story when he was young, a background story to be precise) 

What I like:
- Rem. Yes Rem. And maybe most of other audience does. Rem is one of those character that progressing REALLY WELL in the story. You can see how she change throughout the episodes. how and why her relationship and feelings for Subaru growing strong. She is strong and yet you can find a soft spot in her character.

- The romance conflict. I might say the romance conflict is really nice. Emilia is loveable, Rem also loveable, Subaru have a strong will and he is really expressive (too much most of the time) and all the romance conflict is relevant to each individual background (Emilia being a half elf silver haired witch, Rem being a half devil, Subaru being stupid and helpless but strong will) Not to mention that Subaru forbidden to mention his Reset ability which is make the case even harder. But what I think audience need to get is that love romance doesn't developing faster than the series and ended up hanging (as I said before it need a longer series to make it a complete story and finish)

- Wilhelm arc story. It is beautiful imo and it gives a different wind to the story. I was hoping if there will be the next season for Re Zero, they will come up with more background story (just like Wilhelm story) like the story of each kingdom ruler candidate history and side story. (We don't even know Emilia and Subaru background story for Godsake! We don't know who they are, why Puck tagging along with Emilia and kept on saying Emilia as her daughter etc, where they come from, how do they got into their current character they are) I am seriously have no idea why the author doesn't make it an agenda to make proper introduction on each character. Which is will help to make a greater emotional connection for the audience with each character.

- Emotional connection. I got pretty nice emotional connection with Rem since she got introduced quite a lot to the audience. But somehow I despise Subaru and technically don't care with him, which is actually bad thing since he is the main character. I just hope he doesn't hurt Emilia and Rem more than he does.

Arts:
The art is cool. I love the coloring, the face construction. Art always been kinda priority for me before continuing the series and Re Zero doing great. Emilia is so loveable, Rem, and most any girl in the series. The man varies from bishounen to shounen. The environment really rich in colour and details. But I have seen better in Kabaneri, Inari konkon, bakemonogatari series, so I will settle with Score 9 here in arts.

Sound;
I love the ending and opening which I find it suited with the anime theme and all. I just hope they make instrumental soundtrack during the scenes instead of the full voice music. Styx Helix really bring a strong atmosphere of romance and battle, Paradisus Paradoxium also. Myth & Roid really fit into the anime so well, and the way the music mixed really match with the weird theme of Subaru got summoned to another world with reset ability (or curse). 'Stay Alive' in contrast is a soft spot in the series that really fit all Emilia x Subaru x Rem in term of romance. But for 'Redo' I don't particularly find it fit with the anime but still I like this anyway (don't know if it because I love the anime that I then love the theme song or vice versa)

Overall:
As I said in the start, I have like and dislike but in the end I enjoy the anime a lot. I enjoy and quite hopeful with the next episodes since the first episode. But then they leave me hanging with that episode no.25. 

I DEMAND 2ND SEASON! I DEMAND EXPLANATION & I DEMAND A PROPER ENDING!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,RecommendedSpoiler,"This review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is solely based on my personal views and overall enjoyment watching the show.

Story: With the influx of all these anime shows about a protagonist being transported into a fantasy world/game, this specific show, Re:Zero, certainly doesn‚Äôt sound like anything special. In fact, when I first heard about the anime announcement for this show, I was pleasantly surprised but not at all hoping for anything that would blow me away. To me, I was hovering around the idea that if anything, I would enjoy watching the show because ‚Äì while not original ‚Äì it might end up being
                  ...
something fun. This is coming from someone who only briefly skimmed through the manga and had no true prior experience with this series from the light novel or web novel before watching this anime.

After finishing this show, I really had a hard time figuring out how I wanted to say what I wanted to say about all the things that happened, all the things that I felt while watching Re:Zero. One thing was sure, Re:Zero‚Äôs story was anything but special. But I feel like the point was, that while it was only average in terms of bare story, how the author developed the story ‚Äì and characters (which I‚Äôll get to later on) truly made Re:Zero something special to me.

Characters: Where do I even begin? This show has some better character development I‚Äôve seen in a long time. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but that‚Äôs just how I felt. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm right, but I‚Äôll go into a little detail as to why I think so. One particular character that receives a lot of hate for what he does and how he acts is Subaru, the protagonist of Re:Zero. I can understand how people feel, but the self-reflection and growth that Subaru had by the end of this series was truly something unique. 

I know, I know - this is a fantasy setting, but how realistically portrayed the feelings of each of the characters is depicted really sold it for me. Obviously not every character had the same ‚Äúgod-tier‚Äù character development as, let‚Äôs say Subaru or Rem (I won‚Äôt go into them anymore than I already have, I don‚Äôt want major spoilers), but something that I found myself doing was actually caring about characters - characters that weren‚Äôt necessarily the main focus. I actually was interested in characters like Wilhelm and his quest, and cared about him enough to hope he was successful. From the friendship of Subaru and Julius, to how Felis felt doing something he didn‚Äôt want to do, I actually cared about the characters and how they felt. All these moments were what made this show much more than I could have ever asked for.

Art: There really isn‚Äôt much for me to say about the art. It fit the show. There were certainly moments that I thought the CG looked off, but for the most part, they did a good job with consistency. And I have to give them props for not using CG for some major scenes with big creatures flying around in the sky. (I‚Äôm sure you guys know/will know what I‚Äôm talking about after watching the show). 

Sound: What can I say? White Fox did an outstanding job setting a mood with the right music - or a lack of music to really emphasize the scene. I felt so many emotions that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have felt if they hadn‚Äôt went the extra mile with the right background music, or the right ringtone in a scene. The amount of effort that White Fox put into each and every detail in the sound department was award winning in my honest opinion. They made the scenes that were already great, exponentially better because of how they used the score/OST. Also, props to the voice actors/actresses. Some of the VAs must have worked their asses off to pull off the voices we heard in the show. I honestly have nothing but praise for the VAs and sound department working on this show. They did one hell of a job.

Enjoyment: Obviously, as enjoyment is subjective from person to person, I won‚Äôt expect you all to agree with me on liking this show. Some people are more critical. Some people want to hate because they didn‚Äôt like how the show‚Äôs direction went. It could be because two characters didn‚Äôt end up together that you really ‚Äúshipped‚Äù together. Or it could be because you didn‚Äôt like the main character and how they acted. But in the end, my personal enjoyment is pretty important as to how I rate a show. And while there were moments I didn‚Äôt like as much as others, it wasn‚Äôt like I didn‚Äôt like the show. Those moments, where I didn‚Äôt like a character, or direction, honestly was just a byproduct of how invested I was in Re:Zero and its characters. 

Re:Zero is a ""deconstruction"" (üôÑ) of your every-day, generic transported-to-a-fantasy-world-esque show, and I certainly think the show does a pretty solid job at what it set out to do. But what it really is, at least to me, is a story about growth and hope towards the future. It defied my expectations and went the extra mile in so many categories - the sound department for one, but especially the characters. It made me feel connected to not just the main characters, but to many of the side characters, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve felt this invested in a show and its characters for a long time. Now, after reading this far I'm sure you know where I stand at least in terms of recommendation. Would I recommend Re:Zero? Yes. I really would. Do I expect everyone to like it as much as I did? No. Definitely not - after all, this show wasn't perfect - it's far from it. But I personally feel like it‚Äôs worth giving a watch.

Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Ahh Re:Zero, the anime that is in my opinion looking to be the best show this year (beating erased). The anime that actually inspired me to write my first anime review, despite me being a lazy fk. 

Apart from having excellent art, soundtrack, story, voice acting (especially voice acting) and direction (pacing) there are several underlying themes and messages (sometimes subliminal/hidden ones like in its OP). This is a show that will go against all of your preconceptions, judgements and/or expectations of a trapped-in-an-another-world type anime and will present to you something that feels entirely original somehow. It's one of those don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover type shows. 

There
                  ...
are many things I could talk about this show that would take too long to express, so I'm just gonna stick with presenting some plus and negative points.

+ Interesting story about a shut-in neet suddenly appearing in fantasy world and has a strange respawn ability 'return by death'. With no purpose/reason for his summoning he has to cling to those around him and deal with things that will challenge his very sense of self. My synopsis might seem cliche and uninteresting but since I'm lazy I cbf going too much in-depth (I'll probably spoil it anyway). The story however is surprisingly the strong point because I consider the world-building in this show to be top-notch. Even though it has a time-travel attribute, it is not similar to Steins;Gate (which casts a shadow of expectation over it). It is a fantasy story first and foremost, and a very well made one at that (not the harem/romance type or Lord of the Rings type fantasy, it's more like a 'follow the journey of the MC through the world' type fantasy). It certainly isn't predictable, cliche or boring to watch (except the first few episodes). 

+ Soundtrack is very good. It doesn't simply have catchy OP's and ED's but impressive orchestral music and also utilises the sounds of objects, breathing, movements to really set the tone of the scene and your expectations of what is about to happen. Episode 15 is a good example of this.

+ Right off from episode 1 we see very good art/animation (but not so good during some slice of life scenes). It manages to be fairly consistent throughout each episode and does give off the feeling of watching a well-made show. Character designs are also top-notch, with characters that actually add to the story being drawn well enough to be memorable; almost all characters/creatures were unique looking as well. I don't think there's a single character that looked boring, plain or weird. 

+ The biggest selling point of this show is its constant sense of mystery, foreshadowing and the whats-gonna-happen next factor. Unless you've read the light novels for this show there is no way you can predict what happens next, even on a minute-to-minute basis. It was almost a 'one cliffhanger per episode' situation going on. Although this is fairly what you'd expect from time-travel like plot, the plot twists and cliffhangers don't feel off-putting, outlandish or just plain weird (think Mirai Nikki's weird ending). Instead they actually do what they are supposed to do - shock and hook you, get you hyped and make it hard for you to stop binge-watching. The best comparison to this feeling is watching Game of Thrones. 

+ Main plus point for me was the fact that RZ took an overused genre, flipped it on its head and excluded nearly every character and plot trope that makes the genre so hated. Although its not blatantly presented to the audience, there were several central themes that were strongly developed that were in my opinion quite meaningful. Primarily, the deconstruction of what a true hero/protagonist should be was a key reason why I rated the show even higher than I might normally do. 
Although it happens a lot in anime, the dialogue, execution and specific way the show demonstrated this theme, was quite unique (chiefly that its 'unlike' most shows) and outstanding. For the sake of brevity, I'd suggest watching the show to judge it for yourself but I think one would at least somewhat agree with me on this. 

Despite having many other +'s I could talk about I'm just gonna skip to the negatives cos this is getting TL;DR.

+/- Main character Natsuki Subaru does not follow that standard behaviours you'd expect from a protagonist. Although he isn't made into a sort of anti-hero or villain like Light Yagami (death note) he certainly isn't a great person. This show is really self-aware of the kind of things a protagonist should do but it instead illustrates a MC that doesn't necessarily always do it. In short, the MC isn't made to be appeal to the audience's expectations (he, like the other characters in the show, feel poly-dimensional), so often there are cringy scenes/dialogue/inner thoughts around Subaru that can really make you dislike him at some points, but you can be rest assured that he does end up redeeming himself. He becomes the protagonist we all want in the end - starting from zero hehe. Essentially his character could decide whether its a plus or minus point for you. If you don't take the time to understand his character, and pay close attention to the show, it's likely you'll think he's dumb, over-dramatic or whatever (which is what most critics try to argue); which is a shame because he is actually very well-written. 

- This does not affect me personally but there are some hard-to-watch scenes, blood and gore so it might not appeal to everyone. I certainly don't think its done to the point where you'd just want to drop the show but I can say that it doesn't hold back at trampling over your heart lol. In other words, there is plenty of shock value but there is always a 'weight' to the gore, unlike Tokyo Ghoul where there is literally blood/gore everywhere all the time and you don't feel anything, its more like that feeling when you first watched Attack on Titan and you're just there like 'WHY? OH WHY?'

Overall it doesn't matter if you think its good or bad at first, I would recommend just diving into it because regardless of its plot, it is definitely one of the best shows this year. Most of the hate the show receives is pretty much coming from people who want to de-rate it because they weren't that impressed, or they completely missed the meaningful points the show presents etc., and they end up using nit-pickery arguments or misrepresent/misunderstand/over-exaggerate some of its negatives. Trust me, it's not nearly as bad as any negative reviewer would make you believe. 

Re:Zero is a fun show to get hooked on. It doesn't primarily concern itself with being philosophical, something really deep or trying to be a masterpiece - although episode 18 and some other episodes show potent and interesting digressions of human nature. Its not the best thing ever, but it definitely is above average. 

You can really see how it is a passion project and that White Fox has put it in a lot of effort into it. It's definitely a must-watch show. Although it does have some flaws (mainly near the ending of the show), the cumulation of so many amazing moments and the dramatic, fun and interesting ride that I went on while watching this convinced me to award it a 10/10. 

P.S If I had to rate it as objectively as possible I'd still give it as least an 8/10 but it just doesn't feel right. It simply excels in every department I can think about (or care about anyway), exceeded my expectations and was just too enjoyable a show to give it an 8."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"This was hands down one of the best anime I have ever seen, The story, art and soundtracks fit together like pieces of the same puzzle giving off - Depending on situation - A feeling of happiness or despair. It will keep you at the edge of your seat craving for more, and that's exactly why I waited for it to finish airing in order to start watching.

For the first time I've sort of connected with the main character, and lived through the ups and downs of the story, felt happy at the heart-warming moments, and cried at the desperate ones.

This anime proves to us
                  ...
that an MC doesn't always have to be Overpowered in order to look cool or be a true hero! Unlike your typical ""Transported to another world"" series, this one was truly a masterpiece unlike others, and didn't succumb to the stereotypical ""POWER LEVEL... OVER 9000!!"" idea that most Main characters transported to another world have.

But don't get me wrong, one doesn't have to be special, have unparalleled mana or Saitama-leveled physical power at all! This series shows us that willpower is enough in order to turn the tables, and to the point where even a weak human can become a hero.

If you put aside the fact that it's a fantasy anime, it won't get any more realistic than that! In my opinion the producers tried to make us understand something: You might go through lots of desperate moments, might lose people dear to you, make the wrong choices and despair, but that's exactly what it means to be human, we all make mistakes, a lot of them, but we all have the ability to fix them, and that is exactly what you'll witness in this series. And as I always say: ""If you try to move forward while looking back, you will -Without a doubt- trip and get hurt.""

I'm not a fan of long reviews so I'll end it here, even if you know that it'll get a happy ending, YOU WILL GET HIT BY THE FEEL TRAIN! And dozens of times at that, but it'll be one hell of a ride and an amazing experience! It might sound weird saying this but even if it's an anime, you'll definitely get something out of it.

And last but not least, the one thing we shouldn't forget: #RemBestGirl2016!!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"I'm pretty sure some of you are thinking that Re: Zero is another overhyped anime that isn't nowhere near the hype it deserves. Well, let me just say it now: Re: zero deserves all of that hype and score, or at least most of it. It is an exceptional anime, composed of many different kinds of elements that elevates the anime even further. The entertainment (and despair) it manages to give every single episode is astounding, and paired with great characters and great animation and music, makes this anime truly a must watch for any anime fan.

You probably have already seen this kind of a
                  ...
premise before. The main character living in a normal world, suddenly gets dragged into a completely different world. And also time travel. It is not the most unique premise by any means, but time travelling as a genre has been one of the more difficult ones to work with. In anime, time travel might not make sense, create gigantic plot holes, and can potentially halt any kind of character development. Unfortunately, Re:Zero does have some small plot holes regarding time traveling, but that's to be expected since the story is not yet completed. However, Re:Zero still brilliantly manages to weave in the time travelling aspect of it so that it still manages to be entertaining and bring a good development.
I also feel like that this anime is a great example of how to make every single episodes. It doesn't drag, nor feel boring. Each and every episode is just so fun and makes you want to watch more and more of it. Another awesome thing to point out is that, Re:zero sometimes likes to omit openings and endings in some episodes, giving it even more minutes to work with, which was awesome to see, as one thing I feel like most anime need more of is time. (This is not saying the openings and endings are bad in any way.).
One unfortunate thing about this anime however, is the fact that the adaptation isn't close to finishing yet, so we are left with a lot of unanswered questions. Lot of things like the essence of how Subaru is able to go back to a certain checkpoint or the fate of the bowel hunter is still unclear. 

The animation is also fantastic. It doesn't have clunky movements nor uncomfortable lighting. The fight scenes are great to watch, but the best parts for me were those lighting touches in the background which contrasted well with whatever the scene given. Sometimes light, sometimes dark, it just affects the mood of the scene so well. Some episodes, the animation is done so brilliantly that some scenes almost feels like a movie.

The sound section is great as well.. The soundtracks are really nice to listen to, the standouts being the ones with choir,  and they accompany the scenes really well, especially in episode 15. It isn't a standout of the anime, but it is definitely worth noting, as it manages to stay consistent throughout the episodes. The voice acting in Re:Zero is amazing. The seiyuus, especially Kobayashi Yuusuke (Subaru), bring out some amazing emotions from the characters, which obviously is a must have in a despair-inducing anime like Re:Zero. Also, who can forget Yoshitsugu Matsuoga's unbelivable performance on Beteleguese? The voices aren't annoying, the soundtracks are great, and the OP/ED are one of the best of the season. It is just a really solid aspect in the show.

Now the most important part in any anime: the characters. First thing is, I see a LOT of hate for Subaru. Granted he isn't strong and is sometimes frustrating to watch, but I personally don't think he's that bad of a character. We see him struggle, fight against the seemingly impossible, and eventually develop as the series goes on. He might not be the most pleasing MC to watch at first, but I feel like this is what Re:Zero is all about: Natsuki Subaru's development. You first see a guy, cocky and arrogant, who runs into hopeless despair, so useless, yet trying to do everything by himself, transform into a guy who willingly seeks help from others to save Emilia and many others from the horrible fate awaiting them. 
There are also a lot of other diverse characters in the show. Rem, for example, is easily the most likable character in the show. Her strong willed determination and great fighting prowess is a shining light to Subaru in many ways. We also have Emilia, Suabru's love interest and a half elf trying to ascend the throne although being discriminated by others for being too similar to a witch. The relationship between her and Subaru, although at times cliche, develops throughout the series, along with Subaru's personality.
One thing I like about Re:Zero is that it literally has everything in terms of characters: Struggling MC, powerful woman beside the MC, maids, lolis, traps, knights, psychos... everything.

To sum it up, Re:Zero is definitely a must watch show from the year of 2016. Its intensity, suspense, plot twists, and development makes the hype completely justifiable imo. The awesome fights and dramatic cliffhangers all add to the anime. Though the story itself is might not yet completed, the questions might still remiain, these unanswered questions only further serve as a good reason to watch the next season of this great anime."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Re:Zero is the story about Natsuki Subaru who is summoned to another world, a magical world. He befriends or more like falls in love with a half elf girl who saves his life from hoodlums so in return Subaru wants to help her finding her lost insignia. He and the girl are killed by another person while looking for the insignia. Just then Subaru finds himself alive back to the moment when he came in this new world with the memories of his death and everything that happened. And so starts the great journey of Subaru.

Now Speaking of Subaru he surely was a good main
                  ...
character, well he was cringy sometimes but dude was a gentleman and likeable unlike other trap in another world anime MC *cough Kirito-sama cough*. Characters overall were mostly good Our main heroine(don‚Äôt know if telling her name will be a spoiler) is really kind, beautiful and strong lady and no tsundere characteristics thats a win right?. She doesn‚Äôt get much time in second half but the person who gets that time is REM!!!!! Yes the best girl, The Ultimate waifu material!. OK that is not really how I think about her but she gets a lot of development than any other female character and she is quite lovable. Other characters don‚Äôt really get much time but its ok at least they‚Äôre likeable.

Another thing that I liked about Re:zero other than the characters was the amount of substance. There were so many events and it felt that the show is progressing at a fine pace. OH and the animation was great as well same goes for sound. Voice acting was really good especially the voice acting of the villain Petelgeuse. 

There were so many cute moments and then there were insanely brutal and heart-wrenching scenes. I felt bad for the Subaru when he was in pain, I smiled when rem did, it was just so nice.I cared for the characters and that‚Äôs another win

AND OH MY KAMI-SAMA EP 15!!!

Overall Re:zero was an amazing experience for me. I enjoyed the hell out of it without turning my brain off. Great characters, great animation and sound and heart wrenching moments, Its just great and I don‚Äôt think there is any need to find anything bad in it of course there might be some but I really recommend you to watch it. 8.75 out of 10

+great animation and sound
+loveable characters especially Rem
+A progressing story
-A slow start(truly slothful)
-still there is need for season 2. Can‚Äôt wait for it my head trembles!!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Hey there, do you enjoy watching a decent romance+drama+action anime with realistic characterisation that attempts and mostly succeeds in depicting the effects of a teenage boy seeing and even experiencing death over and over again? Well look no further, because if so, you have an interest in observing a mental breakdown and the subsequent road to redemption. Re: Zero depicts this fairly well.

To put it simply, Re: Zero has a distinct personality that is accused of being generic and edgy. Nothing quite screams generic as a character that makes mistakes and learns from them. It's almost as if he is human. If you never make
                  ...
mistakes or have an aversion to making mistakes and improving yourself, please avoid this show. 

A maturing male protagonist? Check. A mysterious female protagonist that raises more questions than answers? Check. Girls with washboard racks because such people actually exist, and where one of them may have feelings for the male protagonist because what is love? Double check. You have your average level of diversity of characters which allows a show to appeal to a wider demographic. Such characters include, the temperamentally affectionate one, the little people and the odd ""weird"" ones which definitely are indicative of a bland cast. Who wrote this?

The story is a melting pot of genres such as drama, romance, mystery, action and more which is a treat to watch in measured doses. Of course, i could compare it to another deconstruction such as madoka and point fingers all day accusing it of being a failed transplanted clone. I won't though. Who would do that? 

With elements of mortality (or lack thereof) as well as violence and time travel, your expectations are sure to be sated unless you have an aversion to life itself which has its share of serious and light hearted moments. If you have an aversion to anime which depict both the ups and downs of existence, please avoid this show.

I respect the characterisation of the male protagonist because he evolves from being a wide-eyed wannabe hero to twisted selfish person to knight in shining armour (minus the armour).
He is a boy of many identities; Selfishbaru, Sadbaru, Madbaru, Badbaru, and Whippedbaru.

Art was a little iffy for my taste but sound was satisfying.

Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Well I¬¥ve started watching Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu  not knowing what to expect.
I¬¥ve heard a lot of people comparing to other series such as KonoSuba or Gate, except a bit darker. During the first episode it seemed pretty casual, nothing really innovative, but at the end of the first arc I really wanted more. So, here goes my review for Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. IT CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST 2 EPISODES.

Story: 9/10

The story of Re:Zero is at times complicated, at times predictable. It is that contrast that makes it enjoyable. Of course, there are a lot of series with much more
                  ...
complicated plots, but they tend to be hard to watch. Re:Zero took a pretty simple story of a teenager somehow finding himself in this medieval fantasy word. Nothing new, right. Well, that is until the MC somehow goes back in time, after being murdered. That is one of the most important part of the story, as well the part which makes it less predictable. Some things will be going alright and then the MC just dies, and must do things all again. While I loved most of the story, there were a few episodes in the middle which felt a little bit too cringy and dragged out. Also, since it probably will have a 2nd season, the story left quite a few unanswered mysteries.

Art: 9.5/10

You can probably find quite a few shows with a fantasy colorful setting ( KonoSuba, as mentioned earlier), so what makes Re:Zero different. Well, this shows art and animation are fantastic in my opinion. The character have somewhat original faces, the background are usually filled with details, making the world seem more alive. The animation is nice and smooth, and they even managed to make big battles smooth through good 3D animations. Although some of the non-humans look too similar. 

Sound: 8/10

The soundtrack was pretty good. The ambient makes it a much more enjoyable show, even through the more story-driven parts of the series. The battle music gets you hyped up. The intro was good

Characters: 8/10

This show has a few very interesting characters, with good backstories. Our MC Subaru Natsuki is sometimes one of them. I don¬¥t what to spoil much, but if you watch the show you¬¥ll see what I mean. He sometimes acts very cool, other times he can be boring or even cringy. There are a few characters that will make you feel sad, some will make you hate them. MY main complain would be the sometimes appalling acting of the MC, and some other characters that were just dropped after a couple episodes without mentioning them anymore.

Enjoyment: 8/10

A cleverly written story, with a few twists, interesting characters, a lively world, a good soundtrack. It really feels like a compelling story, it can even make you interested in the history and lore of the world that it is set in ( Which is pretty good for a 25 episode long show). But I can¬¥t give it a higher rating then 8, because a few episodes in the middle were kind of hard to watch in my opinion.

Overall: 9/10

As I said already, it really a great show. A strong contender for best summer 2016 anime. If you like fantasy anime, i recommend it to you. If you like some soft-core horror anime I would recommend this to you. If you like romance anime, yeah I guess it passes. Maybe there is an anime that gives you all this and even more, and it really loves you and respects you, but I love Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu."

As of writing this, it will be my first, and probably only, review. To put it succinctly, this show is amazing. It was the show that made me get an account and write a review.

It starts basically as a generic Boy goes into an RPG. But it is so, SO much more. The characters are realistic. There is humor. There is also gore- it is not for the squeamish. The story is engaging. I guess a murder mystery would be the closest way to describe it. I have never enjoyed those, but my gosh- each and ever episode leaves you hooked,
                  ...
and indeed on a cliffhanger. Perhaps the best thing, however, are the characters.

The Main Character takes a little bit to get his power. This is understandable. However, he remains relate-able, for the most part, THE ENTIRE TIME. The Supporting Cast is all amazing. It's Episode Seven. They already have a fully fleshed out currency, a fleshed out backstory, a couple of fleshed out B plots, and a fleshed out setting.

The OP and ED are frequently skipped for MORE story. The animation is gorgeous but not the best. The VA's are INCREDIBLE. 
Story-10
Art-8
Sound-9
Characters-10
Enjoyment-10
Overall-10
I have only given one other anime a 10, and that was a 9.5 I rounded up, and before I found this place. This show is probably the only true 10/10 I've seen. It is simply amazing to me.

Obviously I am new at this review thing, so I will update it as the season progresses. Hopefully it doesn't peter out.


Update as of Episode 9-

The Characters get more and more complex, the sound and artwork is getting better not worse. I have little else to add, but I will bump Art up to a 9. So a 9.75, still a 10. It is absolutely great, an amazing show. But be sure to bring tissues, because for all the good stuff it's also incredibly sad at many many points.

And another Update as of 11-

No spoilers, but it gets better and better. I have now been spoiled, though it's a good thing as I know where it's headed. IT DOES NOT lose steam. It IS sad. I don't know whether to classify it as Romance, Adventure, Horror, or something else. It's a portmanteau of all three, but the Horror is far far more prevalent than the others.

Update as of 18-

All I can say is it keeps getting better. Some rocky cringe episodes. I HAVE spoiled myself at this point. But for those couple of bad episodes, well, this entire anime is adapting so little it's basically the prologue of a greater story. And besides those bumps, the train has no breaks. It's amazing. Arts moved up to 10/10, leaving sound the only 9/10. Again, I can't get enough of this.

Update at end- 

Welp, it's over. I gotta say, they cut a good amount of things I wanted to see. Especially at episode 25. However, that being siad, it was a show. They cut the OP and ED ALOT to fit in all they could- I can't fault them at all. It's still a solid 10/10, and I loved this show from the moment I started to the end."

I couldn‚Äôt find a good way to seamlessly write this review, because there are just too many things to talk about here. (Also I got really busy around the time I needed to write this.) So, instead, I broke it down into points. If you want to skip any of
                  ...
them, here‚Äôs a small list.

1. First impressions, and my general tastes
2. The main character, Natsuki Subaru
3. The other characters
4. The pRe:Duction (Art&Sound)
5. The story as a whole
5A. Arc 1
5B. Arc 2
5C. Arc 3
6. What I liked and didn‚Äôt like

Overall scoring is at the bottom. The subsections of #5 are kinda spoilery, so I recommend avoiding those if you haven‚Äôt yet seen this show.

1. First impressions, and my general tastes
First off, I like this new ‚Äúisekai‚Äù genre, this new type of series where some kid gets sucked into a fantasy world, game or not. I think it‚Äôs a fun idea that has a lot of room for exploration and offers a lot of freedom while carrying its own interesting ideas by just being a game or something. Unfortunately, a lot of shows like Sword Art Online and Overlord give this genre a bad rep for being shit, but I still think that this ‚Äúgenre‚Äù can shit out a good show at any given moment.
When Re:Zero started, I thought it was a fun time because the main character was a little bit like Kazuma of KonoSuba, which had just ended weeks prior at the time. Granted, the show was nothing close to KonoSuba due to its dark tone, but I still thought it was gonna be fun, and the dark twist in Return by Death was really interesting. I wasn‚Äôt calling it the anime of the season right away, but I did believe it had potential to improve. It certainly did, and that‚Äôs exciting for me.
I certainly recommend this for any fan of the isekai ‚Äúgenre‚Äù. And while it isn‚Äôt meta-busting like KonoSuba, the main character is a deconstruction of the typical main characters of these shows.
Which brings me to the next thing‚Ä¶

2. The main character, Natsuki Subaru
This reckless faggot has been a bit of a controversy throughout Re:tarded‚Äôs run, especially in the second cour. Personally, I enjoyed watching him. He‚Äôs a very flawed character, but for good reasons, and if you can‚Äôt figure them out then the show will explain them eventually. For example, one of Toyota‚Äôs most annoying habits was how excitable he was after reviving. In actuality, he‚Äôs just faking it because he doesn‚Äôt want to remember how fucking terrifying it is to die. The third arc is when Nissan hits rock bottom and his character goes from annoying to flat-out ridiculous and cringe-worthy. Re:Shit doesn‚Äôt explain that in this way, but it‚Äôs because he gets over-confident due to surviving the first two arcs, and also because he thinks he‚Äôs the main character of a video game. That‚Äôs kinda why Re:Overrated deconstructs the shitty NEET protagonists, because they‚Äôre always supposed to be the great OP hero who gets all the bitches, but instead Barusu is as much of a useless fuckwad in this world as he was in the real world, so he must use what little strengths he has to make a big impact. 
If you want an anime where the protagonist‚Äôs actions always have strong consequences and undergoes a large rise and fall, Re:Pleb has that.

3. The other characters
This is probably where Re:Crap struggles the most, as it definitely doesn‚Äôt have a strong supporting cast. Most of the side characters are heavily underdeveloped, especially the main not-best girl Megumilia. Or, just Emilia for short. She at least serves her purpose as Mazda‚Äôs love interest, but her general lack of anything noteworthy makes it a little hard to agree with at times. More on that in 5C. There is at least one major side character that got some good development, though, and that is Rem. If you haven‚Äôt heard that name at least 653 times within the last three months, then you must live under a very uncomfortable rock, or you didn‚Äôt lose your religion. But I‚Äôm gonna be honest‚Ä¶ Rem is not a very strong character. She‚Äôs not even the best girl of this show. Why? Because that‚Äôs literally what she was written to be. Rem‚Äôs entire character is ‚Äúbest girl‚Äù. Everything she says and does, even the way she looks, it‚Äôs all what you‚Äôd want from the ‚Äúbest girl‚Äù. Sorry, Rem fans, but‚Ä¶ she really is just a huge piece of waifubait. But at least it worked, I guess.
Anyway, that said, I didn‚Äôt dislike anyone from the show, either. REEEEE:Zero is still a fun show at heart, so there‚Äôs still a lot of energy with the supporting cast despite the lack of development. But if you really want a memorable supporting cast, then you‚Äôre probably gonna wait for the other 20,000 seasons or however many seasons this fucking long ass novel series is gonna generate. 
There‚Äôs still some good news, though: it‚Äôs not a harem. Yes, it‚Äôs a light novel with girls, and the main character is a guy. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a goddamn harem.

4. The pRe:Duction (Art&Sound)
It‚Äôs fucking great. Seriously, White Fox must‚Äôve put everything they have to offer as a studio into this. While many twelve-episode shows falter in animation quality after four or five episodes, Re:Budget looks consistently stellar throughout twenty-five. As an action series, this features some intense, well-choreographed fights that can even last multiple episodes with little downtime. Beyond that, some good direction with timely visual effects, facial expressions, and good shot compositions and lighting can make the non-action-y scenes interesting to watch. Even aesthetically, it looks great, with its massive capital setting, and some rather elaborate character designs that dip their toes into the land of fanservice, but not too much. If anything, I‚Äôm actually rather impressed by the lack of fanservice in Re:Fearow. The only thing that I can complain about is the use of CG for the background characters in the capital. Since it‚Äôs a big city, there needs to be a lot of people, or‚Ä¶ creatures. There are certainly a lot of them, making it look like an actual city, but they‚Äôre animated with some pretty shitty CG, which breaks the immersion a bit. Unfortunately, this is just a lose-lose situation for White Fox, because no one wants to spend a bunch of time animating useless characters in the background, but if they removed them or simply didn‚Äôt animate them, the city wouldn‚Äôt feel real. In this case, I‚Äôll just appreciate what they attempted. CG:Zero still looks incredible.
And this goes hand-in-hand with the outstanding voice acting. I don‚Äôt know who the fuck Yusuke Kobayashi is or how he got the role of Mitsubishi, but I‚Äôm glad he did. This character is intense and super emotional, with a ton of screaming and crying and all that edgy goodness, and he makes it sound completely natural. Someone give this guy a fucking cupcake or something. Similar praise can be said for Inori Minase, even though she once played Hestia, who still haunts me to this very day. But in this case, she played Rem, another edgy character who has a tendency to scream and cry a lot. There‚Äôs also Rie Takahashi, who plays Emilia. Her voice is adorable. That‚Äôs all. But my absolute favorite was Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, aka that one guy who voiced Kirito. Holy shit, what a performance he gives as Betelgeuse. I already loved him for his dynamic voice and quick timing, but this might actually be his best role yet. And that‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs had a prolific career already.
The first OP is one I especially love, and it‚Äôs not just because Konomi Suzuki can fucking sing. I also just love how the song itself dips up and down a few times before finally making a big landing. It‚Äôs very characteristic of the series, and the creepy, mysterious visuals that accompany it help. The second OP is by Myth&Roid, who‚Äôve only been around for a year but have already made some of my favorite ED‚Äôs‚Ä¶ including the first ED of this show. And also the insert songs in episodes 7 and 14, which are intense as hell. But back to the OP; it‚Äôs very mediocre visually, but the song is interesting. It had to grow on me, but it does a good job at setting the unsettling tone of the third arc. 
It‚Äôs interesting to note, though, that most episodes don‚Äôt actually play the OP or ED with their visuals. Sometimes you‚Äôll get one or the other, sometimes you‚Äôll get neither, and sometimes the ED song will play over a scene, making it very difficult to follow along with because I‚Äôm busy belting out ‚ÄúSTAAAAAAEEAAAAAEEAAAAEEAAAAEEAAAAYYY AAAAALIIIIIVE‚Äù like a fucking Muse, but there were only two episodes (8 & 20) that played both the OP and the ED with their visuals. White Fox, more often than not, will cut one or both of them out to make room for more of a scene, even if it‚Äôs only an extra minute-thirty. This isn‚Äôt revolutionary or anything, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen this method used so many times in one show before. It‚Äôs a pretty cool thing of them to do, as it makes the credit themes feel a bit more special.
Also, the soundtrack is good but is exceptional in its action themes and not so much in its in-between themes. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say because I spent a little too long on this section, probably.

Now I‚Äôll get into the actual story.

5. The story as a whole
Re:Stay/Night is an interesting take on the isekai genre, as the main character returns to a certain point in time upon dying, while also retaining the events that took place before his death. Obviously, he‚Äôll use this power to his advantage, with each life being a learning experience until he eventually clears some invisible mission and moves the checkpoint forward. I do really like how they play with this mechanic a bit, because it develops Honda‚Äôs character in several different ways. The power itself has great advantages, but can also be extremely terrifying, because‚Ä¶ well, dying probably doesn‚Äôt feel very good, especially when it‚Äôs from having your throat ripped out. 
This anime is very dark and edgy, especially in its third arc‚Ä¶ honestly, I think that‚Äôs for the better. Arc 3‚Äôs main villain is incredibly over-the-top and just utterly ridiculous, but it makes sense that way. Isuzu will reset everything, so what he experiences needs to have a heavier impact, so that he can erase the result, but he‚Äôll still be traumatized by it. 
But I do want to say that I don‚Äôt like Re:Edge specifically because it was edgy. I think the writing was pretty great at several points, and I love what was going on with Yamaha. I think episodes 11-13 and 16 are very underrated because they present some great drama that exploits his flaws to their fullest.

5A. Arc 1
There‚Äôs not much to say about this arc because it sets up the story. It hints that something darker is in the works, but aside from some gruesome deaths, it doesn‚Äôt tread that ground just yet. Instead it sticks to a more playful side to kinda let the viewer‚Äôs guard down, so that when it does finally get dark, it‚Äôll have a bigger impact. About half of it is just fighting, anyway. 

5B. Arc 2
This could actually be the least interesting arc, because it‚Äôs rather slow and presents a great idea for the story, but doesn‚Äôt follow through. Carjoke#9105 has to figure out who killed him as he lives with a bunch of weirdos in a dope mansion; with the Return by Death ability, it‚Äôs easy to set up a mystery scenario. But instead, that element is just kinda shrugged off and they reveal the killer without much leading up to it. It just kinda happens, but that‚Äôs not the entire arc. There‚Äôs more beyond that which I won‚Äôt spoil, but it ends with a long and exciting fight and features some good character development all-around, even if it‚Äôs still not a whole lot for some characters. 

5C. Arc 3
This one‚Äôs weird, because there‚Äôs a lot of good and a lot of not good. This section is also gonna be pretty spoiler-y. ...So, spoilers below.

This arc takes the story in a new direction by giving us a look at the political world. This is something I like, except‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs absolutely no point to it. After Balls goes full Balls, the story goes back to being a festival of madness, with no regard to all this political bullshit. All that can be taken from this big setup is that some new characters were introduced. Except they were already introduced by other means: Felis and Wilhelm came to Roswaal‚Äôs mansion, therefore leading up to an easy introduction to Crusch; that one bitch with the nice appas needed Subaru to handle her appas, etc. All of the story threads that come from episodes 12 and 13 could‚Äôve been drawn in a different way without changing the result of what happens afterwards. Yes, yes, this will all be relevant again‚Ä¶ in another season. Great.
Another big thing about this arc is the great Rem vs. Emilia debate, something that I like to call ‚ÄúWorld War III‚Äù. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, this isn‚Äôt another shitty ‚Äúrem best girl 2016‚Äù post, because I actually defend Subaru‚Äôs unbreakable love. Really, it‚Äôs not hard to understand why he loves Emilia. She‚Äôs nice‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs beautiful‚Ä¶ she has a great rack‚Ä¶ she uses magic‚Ä¶ she saved his life‚Ä¶ she has a great rack‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs voiced by Megumin‚Ä¶ she has a great rack‚Ä¶ she has a furry pussy, and so on. When you have your sights set on something, it‚Äôs hard to look away. But I get it, this is kinda like trying to swallow an apple whole, and that‚Äôs because Emilia has no personality beyond what I said. I wasn‚Äôt being that vague or simplistic, either, she‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a nice person. Rem is everything that you could get out of Emilia, but like thirty times better, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard for people to accept this ship.
And overall, I think this arc was super hype for a while, but episode 15 was the peak for sure, meaning the following 10 episodes weren‚Äôt as great. I still think it had a decent ending, though, disregarding anything that the light novel readers are saying.

6. What I liked and didn‚Äôt like
To basically summarize, I appreciate the ideas this show presents and often thought they were presented well. Other times, they weren‚Äôt exactly implemented badly‚Ä¶ they just weren‚Äôt implemented at all, such as the mystery in the second arc. 
Still, I didn‚Äôt mind the story‚Äôs fuck-ups so much because I still thought it had a really interesting story to tell, and some of the shit that happens just shook me to the core. Re:Zero really was one of the most enjoyable shows I‚Äôve seen in a while; it demanded my undivided attention, earned it, and now I walk away from it with a lot of respect. Though I understand it has its flaws, I‚Äôm here to appreciate what it did, and I‚Äôm very happy with what I got.
That‚Äôs all this review is about.

Also, Crusch best girl faggots.

Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=1,Recommended,"Re:zero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu is a kind of show that tries to be as simple as it simply brings the protagonist Subaru into another world,while at the same time tries to pull out a story that filled with many twists.Its a brave try,yet it works successfully.

Story:(10/10)(35%)
Unique and original story setting.We have ""respawn"",we have different kinds of species of creatures in the another world,all of that are all well drawn and described.

Some people may think the story is too simple but I felt in the opposite way,as the story filled with a lot of twists and climax.Once Subaru was arrived into the unknown world,he met
                  ...
a lot of events which causes him die a lot of times and all the events are all unpredictable,which makes me felt Incredibly excited and thrilled.

Also, Subaru made changes after each of the 'time travel',which made the story continue to move on.Meanwhile,as the story goes on,it introduces different personalities of each character.I think this not only make depths on the characters but also keep the audience stay tuned,which make me felt in love with this anime,make the whole content feels rich.

The story is well-connected with all of the other characters.All of the storyline is based on characters personalities and characteristics.For example,Subaru have desire on become more strong and willing to protect others.But on the other hand,he is over confident about himself,he feels like he is just an otaku in an fantasy world.The fact is Subaru actually has no idea or knowledge about how things actually works in the world,which cause him so many troubles through the story.He is also very unlucky due to many unforunate things bring to him and nearby characters.

Character:(10/10)(25%)
People may think Subaru is dumb and weak,which cause this anime a disaster.However,I think this is actually the highlight of the character development,as when weak people feel he is weak,that person will definitely make improvements.Also Subaru have positive attitude on 
protecting others and caring others.For example,when he first enters the world,he actually not 
afraid yet the first thing he do is to help others.

For other characters,such as rem,ram and Emilia,they all show their point of view when Subaru is tried hard on protecting them.For example,Emilia is first ignores Subaru,then have good impressions on him but then afterwards she was annoyed by Subaru's movement on which Subaru doesn't respect on others.They even being introduced on their back stories on their childhood life,which explains why Rem felt Subaru untrustworthy at first but felt trustworthy with Subaru when Subaru make changes after his death.

All of the above shows that the anime did a great job on describing each characters and able to make the characters individual.

However,since they focus too much on Ram and Subaru,Emilia seems to be forgotten from the show.All I know is Subaru is lovesick with Emilia but only because she is adorable and he wants to protect her but that's it,there's somehow no further explanation on that and the interactions between them is shallow,which the anime could be improved.

Though overall it's still really nice,so 10/10

Sound(includes music):(10/10)(10%)
Sadly,due to the length of the story,the opening or ending music is always being cut off,feel some kind of enjoyment being ripped off,singing in op sounds is a bit unappealing,but it done well on the sound effects,background music and voice acting during the fighting scenes,really could add emotional feelings to the audience.Even during conversions,there's some soundtrack playing on the back,which can fits the story efficiently.

Art:(10/10)(10%)
Outstanding,definitely meet my expectations.:D

The whole animation art looks realistic and the fighting scenes are absolutely exciting,feels like I'm in that world.

Even in the fighting scenes,there are many magic skills,movements and combat with strategy ,which I feels it is extremely rich and exciting.

Enjoyment:(10/10)(20%)

Full of unpredictable climax,plot twists,realistic animation art and nice sound effects and voice acting must kept you remain on seats.

The only problem is that episode 1 is way too long,although episode 1 is able to introduce the whole story background and some of the events occurred in that episode might affect Subaru's decision,the anime should shorten the length of episode in order to make it simple.

But since the good sides overcome the bad sides,it achieves a 10/10 for me.

Overall:10/10(M)<Masterpiece>"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"First of all before watching Re Zero i never actually read the web novels that preceded the series so the first time that i encountered the story, setting and characters was by watching the anime itself. 

Now lets get started. 

The story for Re zero revolves around the character of Subaru being summoned to an alternate world from the modern world that he had resided in. This kind of story is a common enough theme having been started by series like SAO. 

The character of Subaru is the main character of this anime . 
Subaru is your typical teenager and shut in that only cares
                  ...
about himself and thinks nothing of others. Subaru's character changes a lot as the series progresses so much in fact that it's surprises me enough times whenever it happens. This is affected by his love for the main Heroine of Emilia. 

In the beginning after Subaru encounters and befriends Emilia his attempts to impress her was funny but not that wise. This was his first personality. Gradually as he encounters and befriends more and more characters his personality changes and he shreds many of the weaknesses that his personality had and becomes braver, nicer and smarter and by the end of the series becomes a somewhat able combatant. 

Subaru's unique trait however is his unique ability which while sounding silly was actually quite remarkable and in my opinion really suitable for him. Unfortunately the series does not do a good enough job in explaining why and how he got this power. Another season will probably be able explain this. 

Emilia is the main heroine of the series and having seen a lot of animes since i started watching them she has to be the most gorgeous female character i ever seen. Emilia unlike Subaru is not completely defenseless in a fight as she is a mage and a rare type of one as well. Personality wise Emilia  is always willing to help those in need even when it will be easier to just let them be. This is exactly how she met Subaru in the first place lol. 
Her attempts at explaining why she does so despite not getting anything back in return always puts a smile to my face every time i hear her excuses. 

As a character and for the purpose of the story Emilia acts as the main love interest as a well as a motivation for him to survive. In this Emilia functioned pretty well as her personality and cuteness makes her both endearing and lovable. Because of this Emilia fast become one of my fav characters in the anime. 

Rem and her sister Ram are both servants of the lord that sponsors Emilia for the leadership succession race that forms the second arc of the anime. Both work as maids and bodyguards to the lord and to Emilia at the mansion that she lives in.  Rem is featured far more than her sister Ram and can actually be considered the second heroine of the series. While they have a normal relationship with Emilia their relationship with Subaru is the highlight. The relationship between Rem and Subaru changes a lot over the series and especially so after a major event that those that seen the anime would know. The interactions between the two changed after this and though i always shipped Emilia and Subaru a part of me actually wished for Rem to be with him instead such was how sweet they were together. 
In this Rem's seiyuu Inori Minase deserves no small amount of praise as she portrayed Rem's character and personality flawlessly. 

Beatrice is a mage that serves the lord that supports Emilia's claim to the throne. At first Beatrice did not have the best relationship with Subaru but as ever this changed during the series. 
I really liked her character as Beatrice spoke in a funny accent and yet she had a determination to  protect Subaru that she sees as something akin to a friend despite the fact that she will never admit this to him. 

Re Zero's story is another of the anime's strong points and it follows a standard three arc storyline . The story in Re zero is actually pretty straightforward and is relatively easy to understand and follow. Each arc introduces plenty of new main and support characters. Each of the story arcs are intermingled with each other pretty well. Out of the story arcs the succession arc and the witch cult arc was my favorite ones. 

The art and animation for Re zero was some of the best that i ever seen and i would say its something that is to be expected in a triple A anime like this. The character designs were well designed and i though that each character was well designed. 

The music for the anime was pretty good especially the opening and ending themes. The individual scene music was also good and was appropriate for the scenes that it was used in. In particular i enjoyed the insert songs that were featured near the end of the third arc and i have to say that Inori Minase is a capable singer in addition to being a amazing Seiyuu. 

One thing that i like about Re zero is the sheer number of characters that feature in it both main and support.   

Anyone that has seen the anime will no doubt have their own fav characters but for me mine will have to be Subaru, Emilia, Rem, Felt, Crusch, Wilhelm and Beatrice. Additionally the character of Theresia who was Wilhelms wife and though only a guest star was also a great character in small part due to her personality who was portrayed by the seiyuu Minami Takahashi of food wars fame. 

Voice acting for the anime was top notch featuring equal numbers of veterans like Mamiko Noto who portrays the killer Elsa to relatively new seiyuu's like Emilia's seiyuu Rin Takahashi and Rem's seiyuu Inori Minase. 

In conclusion RE Zero was a fantastic anime that had a combination of a fantastic story, excellent characters and excellent voice acting from some of Japans best and up and coming seiyuu's. This was definitely one of this years best anime and i can't praise it enough."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World (ゼロから始める異世界生活, Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu), is one of the brightest gems of the Summer 2016 season. While it is not something flawless, as one might think, this series is definitely doing its best to be enjoyable and interesting for its viewer. In my opinion, the fact that the creator of the series actually cares is very commendable. However, it is an open secret that trying to be fascinating and being fascinating is not the same thing. Thankfully, it is not one of these cases. Allow me to share my opinion on Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World, on
                  ...
the anime that is able to leave one speechless, on the anime that bullies you, and on the anime that shows you many events, which are absolutely impossible to foresee.

Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is a Japanese light novel series written by Tappei Nagatsuki and illustrated by Shinichirou Otsuka that also has three manga adaptations and an anime television series adaptation by White Fox, which began airing on April 4, 2016. The series tells us a story of Natsuki Subaru, a normal young man that lives his normal life in the modern Japan. However, one day, he is summoned to another world. Without knowing the person that summoned him, or the reason for being summoned in the new world, he soon befriends a silver-haired-half-elf girl, Emilia. Due to some unknown circumstances, the girl is being targeted by an unknown assassin. The assassin manages to kill the two and everything seems to be over. Yet, a second later, Natsuki Subaru awakens and discovers his new ability that he names ""Return by Death."" That new ability gives him the power to reverse time by dying; however, only he remembers the events of the previous timeline. Why was Natsuki Subaru summoned in this mysterious world, who gave him the power to reverse time? Find the answer by watching Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World now.

The first thing that might come to your mind after reading the description of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World’s story-line is that this anime is a mix of Steins;Gate, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, and Boku dake ga Inai Machi. And I must say that you will be right to think so. Of course, this anime has nothing to do with comedy, but all these four anime do have a few things in common. Anyway, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World reworks all mistakes of its predecessors doing its best to be entertaining and I must say that Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World manages to do it. It is an open secret that the most important thing for all story-lines is to be complex: one should never be able to foresee more than thirty percent of events that will happen in the next episodes. In case of the anime we are talking about, you might have theories on first, on second, …, on thirteenth episodes, but all your theories will be destroyed in an instant. That is, in my opinion, the best part about the story-line of this anime.

The animation of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is mostly top notch. There are many characters, they have sometimes unusual and sometimes very beautiful outfits, monsters, demons, some unknown creatures, and magic spells and they all are beautiful. At the same time, when this anime should become dark, it becomes dark. It is so amazing that it helps you to dive in the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World. Without a doubt, it is not flawless, but it is on the level, which is very important for all anime that have such a setting.

The OST is on the level, as well. From pop music to amazing orchestral pieces, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World even focuses on music, which some anime tend to not do. Of course, it is not that important, but the amount of attention this anime pays to its music only helps you to dive into the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World and to understand it better. I will not hide the fact that sometimes the music should have been more epic: when you see a good battle, the music should be epic very, but it is still able to make you have gooseflesh. Another part of this section, which is also worth mentioning, is the cast of this anime. All voice actors did one hell of a job making their characters vivid and lively. If it is a villain, you hate them with all of your heart, if it is one of the main heroes, you just wish that they succeed in everything they do and you cannot even imagine what you will do if something bad happens to them.

The cast of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World consists of the main characters, Rem and Natsuki Subaru, supporting characters, and villains. While I would argue that the main characters do not receive enough development, I completely agree with the fact that supporting characters should have received more development. However, I believe that the main characters and the villains compensate for it well, since Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World has the edgiest villains that you have ever seen in your life. Anyway, let us talk about the main characters: Rem and Natsuki Subaru.

Natsuki Subaru is the male protagonist of the series. On the way home from the convenience store, he is suddenly summoned to another world. He later discovers an ability that he names ""Return by Death"" that allows him to go back in time, if he dies. And the most interesting part about it is that only he remembers what happened and he cannot tell anyone about this ability. Natsuki used to be a hikimori, being absolutely useless, he has never done anything in his life. However, in this new world he should not only try to become more powerful, but also to use his wit. He will not be granted with the power to destroy the whole world, he does not have a guardian angel, or a harem of cute girls that will help him in every situation. He just has no other choice but to do everything alone, which makes him change himself. His character development is amazing and you just want to not see him suffer. Rem is the second main character of the series. She has a younger sister and both of them work at Emilia’s mansion. When Subaru meets her, she shows absolutely no signs of being interesting; however, as the story progresses, Rem stops being a doll and becomes a very interesting character.

The supporting characters of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World do not receive enough development; however, as I have already mentioned, the villains compensate well for it. You just want to see their death, you just want to see their sufferings, and you hate them with all of your heart. While I understand that it is impossible to grant enough screen time for all characters, I still think that all characters are very interesting to follow and it should be more than enough for you.

All in all, I cannot guarantee you that you will like this series and I am not going to do it. Personally, I like the fact that this anime tries to rework mistakes of its ancestors in order to not make them again, I like the fact that the characters of this series are realistic and not overpowered like in some other series, I like the fact that it is never possible to guess what will be shown in the next episodes, which is very important, as well. With every episode, you are trying to prolong your enjoyment and to watch this series little by little; however, it is simply not possible. You just want to know what will happen in the next episodes. It is, of course, not flawless, nothing is, but if you want to see something very dark, I would highly recommend you to give Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World a try. I hope that you will enjoy watching Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu!"

It has been recommended for me by at least 3 people and i started watching it because i didn't have anything better to do.
Now it's my #1 favorite of all time, the story is great, the music is very climatic and everything else is almost perfect.
The only thing i can complain about is some characters.
Like, not their character, but rather appearence, mainly Felis and Beatrice, otherwise they're fine.

Anyway, best anime 2016, go watch it, kthxbye"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"As you may guess, when someone gives a 9 to an anime, he isn't going to say it was a bad anime and I am no exception.

**This review contains really minor spoilers, if you don't want to know anything at all about the story or characters, you shouldn't read it**

Story (9/10) : About the story, you know it, no need for a synopsis, it's a few scroll away. Why do I think it deserves a 9?

- Well first of all, the surprise factor. The first episode is a double episode. And while the first part isn't really original, I mean it's a classic transported-to-another-world anime
                  ...
at this point.The second part, however, was really unexpected and definitely drags you into the story. Long story short, the first part is all happy-go lucky, with a cheerful main character that meets a cute silver haired half-elf. And the second part is pretty dark and sinister. That first episode could be compared to the surprise I had when I watched Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and I think it was amazing.

- After that, there is the ""Return by Death"". This is the center element of the story pretty much. Some people will see this as a lazy way to put ""gore"" into this anime when it's just a tool to deconstruct the main character, which is also a main component of the show. I'm the kind of person that don't mind seeing the same background and (almost) the same interactions through 4 or 5 episodes, if you do mind, you should reconsider watching this, if not, then you should be fine.

- The conclusion : To every story there is an end. Don't worry I won't spoil it, I'm just going to say that I think it was a nice conclusion imo. I know some people are really afraid of being disappointed by the end of the anime because it may ruin their experience (*cough* Death Note *cough*).

So, if you like some action here and there, some violence here and there, some gentle moment here and there, you should be fine with the story. Re: Zero offers a nice variety of emotions and plot twists. (As well as some magnificent cliffhangers)

Art 9/10 : Animation is great, colors are pretty bright, the character design is good (lot of people animated in the streets, good looking backgrounds). The direction is fairly good too, I mean artwise there isn't much to say really, it's just good.

Sound 9/10 : The OST is good, especially that little chorus you hear at certain moments, it's really brief but you'll know what it is if you watch it. OPs and EDs are really good too, I love the 1st OP so much.

Character 9/10 : Now, the part that's really important, the characters. Let's do it one by one, shall we?

Natsuki Subaru : Main character. He is transported to that fantasy world and his main goal isn't to go back to where he comes from but to save the half-elf girl. Why? Well, we do know little about his life before the sudden teleportation in this new world. But the first few minutes tell us that he is a shut-in NEET with no real social life and being a fan of video-games (most likely RPGs) this new world is pretty suited for his tastes. However, he'll be going through a lot during the anime, making him unstable at times. I think his evolution/developpment was well handled, now I think I should warn you that he is probably the main reason why people don't like this anime, so if there is one reason you may not like this anime, he is the one. But if you can bear with him, you should have a good time.

Emilia : One of the main female protagonist. She is the victim of discrimination because of the fact she is a silver-haired half elf (saying more would be spoilers). However, she has the opportunity to become the ruler of her country and will do everything to achieve that goal. So, you won't be seeing her all the time, and even if she is the main love interest of Subaru, her lack of developpment and screen-time throughtout the show may not be well received by everyone. But her time will eventually come if there is a season 2. For now, she is an interesting character that we don't know much more about but I would love to hear more about her past.

Rem : One of the main female protagonist. Compared to Emilia, she will receive some developpment. Why? Because she has a key role in the second part of the anime and that developping her is essential at this point. That's what I like about this anime, it develops the character that will play an important role in the near future and I like this way of proceeding. I can only let you discover this character, that you'll get to know thoughout the show.

Enjoyment 10/10 : The cliffhangers, the twists, the brutal violence, the beautiful and colorful scenes, the characters, the atmosphere. All of this make my brain trembles. It is one of my favorites of all-time. Now I'll tell you this, if you're familiar with  the term ""elistist"" I'm just the complete opposite, I don't need a lot to enjoy an anime, and I love the isekai genre. So there was no way I couldn't like this anime.

Overall 9/10 : In conclusion, don't get your hopes up or anything, I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but when it comes to watching anime I think that the less you know, the better. But if you're here reading this, maybe you're just too undecisive, and you really don't know if you should watch this or not. I think the answer is in the first episode. If you liked what you saw, you can go ahead and watch the whole thing. This show repeatedly fits 24 minutes of straight content and I think it's just a proof of the investment and the general quality of this anime."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"This series was amazing! I waited and watched every single episode as it aired. It explores Subaru's character development in the most awesome fashion ever! We see him persevere through all the shit that's happening and still manages to overcome his issues. The common theme gained is learning from your mistakes! 

Re:zero is definitely my favourite anime of all time! I am waiting for the second season and I hope white fox manages to continue this legacy and continue the Re:Zero series.

I have never watched an anime that has invoked so much emotions within me despite the outcome. That's how well this anime was executed."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"At beginning of the season no one was talking about this anime. I didn't even know it existed. I stumbled on it by chance and I saw the summary and poster and thought it was wack.

It was on a sunday night (In April) after watching Kabaneri of Iron Fortress which initaily was my pick as the top anime in Spring (didn't turn out too great). I got nothing else to do so I might as well watch a couple of episodes, and boy I was in for a ride. 

The show surprises in so many ways. The characters are so memorable and charming. The music
                  ...
is moving. Everything is on point. The lore, mystery, suspense, and the gore with a touch moe set it far and apart from other fantasy ""isekai"" anime.

The joy, suspense, tears, laughs, and thrills that came with the show is something that I've never experienced with any other show before. It's been such a ride watching this show from start to finish as well as discussing it with the community here. I love the Re:Zero fanbase. It's just amazing seeing it blossom into something this great and awesome. 

Finally, I feel very passionate about this show. I don't know how to properly explain it. It's like when you're proven wrong but instead of hating you're loving it even more. This show did that to me. It's driving me nuts in a good way.

Fantastic, unforgettable gem that YOU should watch in YOUR life time."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"So I only gave the story a 9 because there is a main part of the plot that hasn't been discovered enough for me, which you may be able to guess after watching the series.

Re:Zero actually started out pretty poorly, I thought I was going to hate the main character. So the first episode's pace is slow but once you can get through it there is 24 episodes of just pure original and brilliant story writing.

The characters are actually pretty unique, although we don't know much about why Subaru is there he actually is a really great guy. He is calculating and as high morals.
                  ...
He goes through a lot in this story and his character development was just the strawberry on top of a parfait of sadness, anger, regret, and tough choices.

Emilia who is the other main character is hard to describe, she is very kind and caring and at first I thought she was tsundere. It actually turns out that she REALLY wants friends but because of what she has gone through she keeps people at arms distance but still manages to be the cutest thing.

There are other characters that are introduced to us slowly but surely and out of all of them only 2 seem to have a trope attached to them out right, everyone seems to have actual unique personalities.

The character design and world design is actually really breathtaking too, I cant imagine where the inspiration is. There are many different races that wander around this land and I REALLY hope we can explore more of the world that Natsuki Subaru was drug into. 

There are nice political themes as well where Subaru has to make decisions to help Emilia going forward and reach a very interesting goal.

This anime had me on an emotional rollercoaster where I had to schedule a happy go lucky anime to calm down with afterward. ALL the characters make you fall in love with them and the way Subaru interacts with them all just warms my heart. This anime can be described as a well rounded anime.

Its Shoujo and light, its serious and has really dark and deep moments, it has gore and turns your stomach, it is super freaking sad at other points. I can't wait for the second season of this and I will be hunting down the manga version and the box set.

The music and sound effects are also really well done and unique, there are times where a certain tone plays and you know something just happened and it leaves you at the end of your seat."

An over all Review for Re:Zero
==================

Re:Zero is an adaptation of the Light Novel originally created by Tappei, being an adaptation can pretty much tell you the story is still ongoing and not fully covered by the anime, but it still brings a nice closure to the 3rd arc's occurrences.


Story-(8): This show deals with the [Time Travel] aspect where the MC is able to rewind to a point in the timeline in order to prevent a lot of sad incidents from happening. So are we going to
                  ...
grow tired from the repetitive tragedies as our MC is just gonna get it fixed? No, that's never the case with Re:Zero. Our MC has no control over the point he rewinds to, and he actually has to pay a very high toll, his ""Life"". When someone around Subaru dies he is forced to confront what they actually meant to him, and how much he is willing to go to save them, Going to very extreme lengths. I would also like to point out this isn't ""Endless-Eight"" all again, the MC faces a lot of different incidents while moving on with the story as well.So the fact that our MC can shape his future doesn't mean that the tragedies have no consequences because it is nicely used for character growth and get us to know more about the sub-characters.This perfectly sums up in a fellow's quote ”These kinds of events will never lose their emotional impact because it's never been about losing people; it's been about finding them.”.THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL FANTASY SAO-LIKE ANIME!!. It's dramatic and somewhat mysterious & dark-themed. basically, every episode ends with a cliffhanger that will leave you hungry for more. 


Characters-(9): Side-Characters get more than enough development in the show, and they actually have their great effect over the MC's and the story's overall progression since the story is mostly character driven in the anime. As I mentioned the time-rewind shows us a lot about the side characters and their past, how they lived on with their traumas carrying it all on their backs but finally managing to recover from it as the story goes. The psychological aspect of the show is strongly emphasized through the MC who constantly struggles, falling into despair and almost running away. Romance isn't one of the main aspects of the show but it acts as a catalyst to the characters' progression.


Art-(8): Moe Art style, but it never bothered me as it make the show's gore and depressing scenes easier to handle and characters even more likable.Although the art starts going low on quality at episode 24, I really respect WhiteFox for holding that long with the quality as they had to work extra time by taking off the OPs and EDs out of some episodes.


Sound-(10): Okay. 1,2,3... EPICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC!!!!!. *cough..cough*. Myth&Roid have really done a great job here, 2OPs & 1ED perfectly show what this show has to promise, the lyrics strongly convey the feelings of the show. White Fox seriously put a lot of work onto the OST and their insert songs that enhance the despair mode and scary vibe. They also leave out both the OP&ED during some EPs to add more content, this shows you how hard White Fox worked on this show.


Enjoyment-(10): Off to the “ My Most Favorite Anime” we go. The show is very captivating and breath-taking, it's packed with very intense moments that can (AND WILL) make you jump off your seat and bump you to death with adrenaline rushes ”Give me more!!!”.


Some Notes:
*) This is my first review ever so please forgive my unprofessional approach at some points and also my mediocre English skills.

 *) The MC may look like a “self-insert” one who got summoned here by chance. Although it's still vague but the shadowing that there is one of the BEST PLOT TWISTS ever waiting at the end of the story is so damn great you can't even think about ignoring it.

*) The ""8"" I gave for the story is mainly because the story isn't completed yet and I can't just judge it completely now, And that doesn't disregard the fact that this show is definitely the AOTY for me."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"ReZero as an anime comes in a time where ""time travel"" animes has been all the rage for ""great animes"", and as LA said in LA's Erased review, LA loves time travel animes and this once again is no exception that LA will love this series from the outset. But saying this is a time traveling anime is a bit vague, at best it's a dimension jumping anime due to the nature of the main protagonist's powers, but that a bit later.

ReZero being one of the more hyped anime to come out of Spring 2016 and really it did live up to it and no
                  ...
it's not because LA is biased towards time travel animes, people have been talking about ReZero ALOT while it was being released, LA has some praise as well as problems to give to ReZero, ok enough introductions, let's get on with this.

Now let's move onto the characters, more specifically, Subaru Natsuki. Subaru Natsuki voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi is by far one of the more unique ""heroes"" in animes LA has seen, sure he is severely obnoxious and very much love to do the entire white-knighting play in order to become the hero, however where his uniqueness comes from is his power, if it wasn't for him, he would have easily be a more downgraded Rintaro Okabe from Steins;Gate, his power is similar to a ""game"", where every time he dies, he gets ""reset"" to a preset instance, cool power right?, but where the consequences and mental trauma sticks from ""dying"" is where Subaru becomes something else entirely, do remember that Subaru is in a fantasy land where witches, elves and ravenous monsters will brutally kill you in the most gruesome way possible and don't LA even get started on the ominous Witch. Subaru's obnoxiousness and whiteknighting personality even gets consequences when he does too much of it. LA will say here and now, Subaru is NOT a deconstruction of the typical hero/otaku archetype we see in many animes we see, LA did say that Subaru is a bit like Okabe and that is pretty close as they both use time travel in some way in order to protect those they love and is utterly determined to save to the point of their brink of their sanity, but ReZero's take on Subaru isn't a deconstruction, it's being ""realistic"" with his ""gaming reset powers"" for both his ""strengths and weaknesses"" to Subaru, because of that Subaru though obnoxiously as he is, he not only evolves, he learns from his mistakes even to the point that his powers can't change due to the ""pre-reset"" limitations, because of that, you can contemplate his misery and goals in wanting to succeed and seeing a realistic yet reckless dimension jumping hero. Ok enough about Subaru, let's move onto Emilia, Emilia voiced by Rie Takahashi is also bit of a unique character, as she's a bit of character archetype (cept Yandere) and on the outset, she was a great ""kind"" character but soon becomes something like a badass in disguise but she has her own goals she wants to do instead of just wanting to be Subaru's love interest, again Emilia is unique for that, however for the ending LA has a small problem with her, but that a bit later. Next up is the twin maids Ram voiced by Rie Murakawa and Rem voiced by Inori Minase, who get their own arcs just like Emilia does and we do get to sympathize with the both of with their backstory and how they got their personalities, however later on Rem gets a bit more screentime than Ram with a bit more of a role and really Rem became LA's favourite character by the end of the series. LA will say that for the most part, the main cast who interacts with Subaru gets lots of screentime, however some characters do get the shaft once Subaru gets into certain arcs, like Beatrice voiced by Satomi Arai and Roswaal L. Mathers voiced by Takehito Koyasu however even this little complaint is easily mended as really some of the arcs in which these characters aren't there don't become important for certain arcs. 

If ReZero does something right is to execute the typical ""guy gets stuck in a fantasy world"" and ""plays against those tropes"" and sure it's plot structure early on fell on a slow yet ""tutorial"" foundation, ReZero later on makes that foundation as dark and violent as possible and utterly deconstructs the anime genre it is in ie. guy trapped in a fantasy world, and that really isn't a terrible thing, actually it's obviously refreshing with some solid writing, plot twists and great animation. LA will reiterate, the plot structure is a deconstruction of it's genre, Subaru as a character and his use of his power is being realistic with a dark undertone. 

LA will say that the plot twists work and executes well for the most part because of Subaru's power and the world building, though it makes sense, Subaru dying over and over again using different routes in order to find the best route would mean we get both world building and getting to know more of Subaru's limitation in power through this. Really because of Subaru's power, he makes leeway and hints to both world building and makes many of the plot twists work. 

The animation by White Fox, has by all means some of the best quality LA animation LA saw, well ""best quality"" isn't the best wording, more like the most consistent. From the colorful character designs to the poignant to fantastical backgrounding to the brutalized and bloody battles, the animation was pretty great, though LA would say that the blatant yet quickly unfocused CGI used sparingly was a bit annoying at times for the animation, though the CGI is and is really rare (be it just offhanded lizard-carts etc.), nonetheless, animation was great even with the awkward CGI...though it felt like te animation took a small dip near the final 2 episodes in some rare scenes. 

Voice acting-wise, the entire cast is pretty well done, with many VA's such as Inori Minase as Rem, Rie Murakawa as Ram, Rie Takahashi as Emilia, Satomi Arai as Beatrice and most especially Yuusuke Kobayashi as Subaru. If anything both Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase would be LA's favorite voice actors in this anime, mainly because the both of them went into the far extreme range in this anime, from dramatically intense to shouting their god damn lungs out to just trying to be genki and ""moe"". The only other voice actor to note is Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti's voice actor Yoshitsugu Mastuoka, well talk about playing against the type, from voicing typical generic heroes *cough* into voicing this eccentric bundle of madness...if it wasn't for Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka might have been LA's favorite voice actor.

If there were any flaws to this anime, would to be put simply, Subaru's powers to resolve everything by the end of it, he always find the right route to do it, be it physically or mentally, he finds a way to resolve matters. The other flaw LA would say is that, the solution or even little hints aren't shown until they are shown leaving us little room to actually make us think on how they are gonna resolve or ever will, but for flaws such as this, LA can easily say there are lots of defense for these kind of flaws due to how well written and executed this anime is that even with these flaws, ReZero can ""get away with it"". As such, Subaru resolving matters does take him more than once and dying in brutalized ways along the way, not to mention Subaru's resolution most of the time has both need help from others (as to be perfectly honest even with Subaru with this power, Subaru is by far the most weakest physical character in the anime) and that his passion and courage to get to his goal in admirable to say the least. The only time this flaw is shown and LA utterly hated is during the penultimate episode as Emilia is shown her moment of resolution with her villagers due to her discrimination as a half-elf and gave Emilia some GREAT character resolution, her badassness was just a bonus!, HOWEVER what with what happened later on it becomes moot comes the next timeline and Subaru effectively ""TAKES THAT RESOLUTION AWAY FROM HER"" just so that he can save everyone including Emilia and she is taken to the sidelines instead of her more badass and touching conclusion to her character, when Subaru gets top billing ALL THE TIME was what LA was annoyed and can justify this flaw as ReZero stumbling with it's compensation for the ""happy ending"", which wasn't good enough compensation that LA. The other flaw's defense can be summed up as due to many of the little hints given only gives the major villain of this series the ""Satella the Witch"" all the more reason to be feared as to what Satella does to restrict Subaru (or heck, even the Witch Cultists are something to be feared by sheer lunacy). ReZero gives us proper clarity (and solid writing) so that Subaru can't just do whatever he wants to AND so that he can't get away with the easiest route, thus makes many of the flaws in this anime as a very minor point. Well there was one more flaw LA noticed, which was that with this huge cast, it was to be expected that the screentime for some of the minor characters are small like LA said on the character section, even some of the main characters kinda get this besides Subaru, he IS kinda the main protagonist and that is the only other flaw that kinda irked LA as there were some main characters LA wanted to see more of *cough* the rest of the candidates to be King in the last half like Felt, Anastasia and especially Priscilla *cough* Rem in the last quarter *cough*...but LA did see why, they just weren't needed during those times and cramming those characters in there just wouldn't add up considering the situations here and there.

If there are STILL people who hate this anime because of Subaru, be sure that ReZero makes sure that Subaru go through hell and back in very physically torturous (and the fact he dies VERY often in horrific ways) and mentally draining moments that can make any sadist who dislikes Subaru grin. As for the typical narmy villains, typical character archetypes in this anime genre and token love interests for character flaws, LA will say that...welll...uhhh yeah LA can't put a defense for those flaws (well besides the narmy villains such as Betelgeuse and Elsa Granhiert, LA utterly loves the pure insane villain) besides the fact that ReZero ISN'T a harem and a more adventure based-dimension hopping anime and to a certain degree with the biggest character flaw going to Emilia, yeah she's a unique character with no character archetype but she's subjected to being bland due to her lessening screentime by the later arcs and for the love interest flaws, Rem outright for LA eclipses Emilia for best girl mainly because of Rem's character and romance development being much more developed than Subaru's whiteknighting romance to Emilia. What LA is being honest.

The ending well if you read the ""flaws of ReZero"" section, you'd know that LA got a bitter taste from the side effect of the penultimate episode had, however it slightly carried over to the actual final episode where Emilia essentially became a damsel in distress and although the final battle was slightly downplayed comparing to some of the other fights, it was decent. Really as much as LA was satisfied with this ending, the method on Subaru trying to get to this ending was slightly on ""easy mode"" besides the final battle. The ending did finally resolve the tension between Subaru and Emilia, however the ending still had a few loose plot threads left here and there ultimately saying to read the manga (unless there's a second season?) but still...as LA said before even with these small flaws in the ending, the ending was still satisfying.

ReZero for LA for it's technical prowess of it's characters and plot is one of the best animes LA has seen in 2016 and LA knows that this anime may not cater to the detractors from the obnoxious main character to the dark and ""edgy"" plot under the typical ""magically transported to a fantasy world"" but LA just can't help but like this anime, ReZero's strengths by far outweighed it's weaknesses."

Amazing story and plot.
Fun and interesting characters.
Good animation and sound.
Felix.
The main characters at first will look like the typical harem-like main character but as the series progresses you will see that thats not the case. In the start of the anime he acts like a self entitled prick but soon sees that that attitude will not get him very far in this world. He is the most humanlike character i have seen, he is not some overpowered guy that will
                  ...
beat all the odds, or someone who gets god-like powers that equal those of the villians. He is an average fit guy.Thats it. He cant go toe-toe with most characters in the series and will get completly destroy if he even tries to. But as you know ""knowledge is power"". Using the information that get got on his previous life he will beat the odds. You might think that this power is OP, but thats not the case as you will see. He fears death,it hurts, at times he feels and seems powerless, its only throught the friendships that he has made that he pulls through. Overall my favorite series of 2016 and easily in my top 5 animes ever.
According to the creator the web novel is only half way there. So we can expect 3 more seasons ( of course only if they are greenlit). So with that in mind i would suggest you watch it ASAP"

Re:Zero is an anime that packs together sorrow, happiness, horror, joy, suffering, and satisfaction into a rocket ship of entertainment. The main character, ripped from his home world and having to start from zero, faces a great deal of adversity throughout the story. As opposed to other stories where the main character is either naturally skilled or somehow surpasses expectations with no degree of difficulty, Subaru must overcome his failures. 
...

Hardly anybody likes to fail. Failure, especially after you've exerted a great amount of energy, can sometimes damage one's self-confidence. Humans, being as imperfect as we are, are also prone to errors. It is not our failures or our mistakes that define us, but the actions that we take to make a change after we've recognized our shortcomings.

Re:Zero does a brilliant job at capturing this essential ingredient of human nature: allowing the main character to fail (perhaps more than he succeeds) and at times succumbing to the overwhelming emotions that pain a person after a profound loss. Although the conclusion of the series might have some loose ends that were never completely tied up, the story is still this series' strong point. There were times of laughter, tears, and utter shock, as Re:Zero pulls the audience in with relatable characters, a stunning original sound track, jam-packed action sequences, and several moments of deep horror. 

The character development was strong in such a way that it was easy to relate to multiple characters and watch their relationships solidify throughout the series. Whether it be the main character overcoming his trials or the relationships between a handful of characters, there is definite development and it is implemented in a beautiful way. One of the best performances of the show was done by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, who plays the character Petelgeuse. While some people are of the view that Petelgeuse was over-dramatized, I am of the view that this super-villain makes the Joker from Batman look cute and gentle. All episodes featuring Petelgeuse sent a shiver down my spine and accomplished something that few other anime have been able to pull off.

Although the animation quality is not of the same grade like what you'd see from a ufotable production or of Madoka Magica caliber, the animators without question paid attention to details and did an outstanding job with the action sequences. There were of course some errors that I could nitpick -- ranging from some ""copy and pasted village characters"" to blood being on a character's face one moment and then disappeared the next -- the errors are trivial and the animation as a whole is good.

Where the animation might lack at times, the sound more than makes up for it. The sound director and sound effects definitely deserve a lot of praise here. Featuring a rich OST, the songs are the type that stick around with you for days after watching the anime and the effects are executed to near perfection.

As someone who adores Steins;Gate for its thrill, Spice&Wolf for its character dynamics, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni for its horror, Madoka Magica for its dark deconstruction, Clannad:AS for its depiction of overcoming adversity, and Kara no Kyoukai for its dark action scenes, it should be clear just how much I enjoyed Re:Zero. One could argue that Re:Zero successfully borrows each element from the previously listed anime -- some of which people consider masterpieces -- and it is for this reasoning why I have rated Re:Zero so highly and among one of my all-time favorite anime. 

There are of course some flaws that should be pointed out, as nothing is perfect. As the series stands and without knowing if there will be a second season, the viewer as an ""anime-only"" watcher will be left with a handful of questions relating to the overall storyline that were left unanswered. If one has followed the source material and has read beyond the anime, some are likely to be dissatisfied with how Re:Zero ended as it currently stands. Although it is understandable that discarding an important scene toward the end of the anime can leave the viewer feeling disappointed, White Fox adapted the source material on the whole faithfully. 

If one can overlook some minor flaws in the animation and the story, it is very easy to rank this anime highly alongside the other gems out there. I will definitely be voting with my dollar and supporting Re:Zero in every way that I can in hopes of seeing a Season 2 adapted someday. 

Overall, I would highly recommend Re:Zero to anyone looking for a combination of an adventure, thriller, fantasy, action, comedy, and romance. It's a great show that is definitely re-watchable and I look forward to owning the blu-rays."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! These words and I'm sure plenty of other words have been used by me and other viewers to describe our feelings for this show. There is in my opinion NOTHING else like this show in how it paces and draws the audience in through a captivating story, the immense dynamic relationships between characters which challenges societal norms, and ultimately a brilliant yet subtle intertwining and overarching plotline. I'm going to go over 5 reasons why this show has become my number 1 show of all time. (fyi this is long, analytical and has spoilers)

1.) The Plotline

Originally, Re:zero was written
                  ...
off as a generic ""Mmorpg new world"" type of anime. It tried too hard to be funny like Konosuba in its first two episodes and lacked the same punch and light-hearted ironic tone that Konosuba did so well. Yet what we see on face value is not what actually develops over time. Re:zero is NOT like any spinoff we have ever seen and in fact, is possibly the most successful adaptation of this ""mc in new world"" genre. 

(SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD) - With a very basic summary, Re:zero is about a NEET, Natsuki Subaru, who finds himself in a new world. Like traditional anime tropes, he believes he is the protagonist of this world and now must save the world from some sort of evil. He quickly finds out two things. First, that his enemy is ultimately the Witch Satella and her cults. Second, after meeting the main girl protagonist, Emilia, he has an obligation as the mc of this world to help her so she can fall in love with him and regain political power, in a different struggle to find a candidate to lead the kingdom. 

Pretty basic stuff. Yet what Re:zero excels at is creating such a generic plotline into a complex and realistic atmosphere. The twist here, is that the mc, Subaru, has the ability to come back alive to a certain point in his life before he was killed. Essentially, he can return by death to some sort of ""savepoint"" to change his future as a result of his knowledge and actions in his previous life. 

It is simply fascinating to see and understand how Subaru operates in this world as he tries to understand the rules, the mannerisms, and the customs  in order to fit in and be able to change the world. In a sense, Re:zero is a trial and error process for Subaru and with each life that he loses comes with both a benefit and a price. For benefits, Subaru gains another important set of knowledge that helps him in his next life to make better rational decisions to achieve his goal and desirable outcome. Yet, remember that death is not something to blow over. In fact, one of the big themes of this anime is how death actually would affect someone like yourself in real life. What type of psychological damage does Subaru incur? What type of emotions does he feel after having to rebuild his relationships back up every-time only to fail and have to do it again? How much mental-fortitude can you sustain before you break because your efforts have been in vain? These are the themes that Re:zero deals with quite effectively. White Fox does a great job in doing this both explicitly through Subaru's increase of rational and intelligent actions while also implicitly as we see a change in his personality overtime.

Another thing the show excels at is pacing and setting up an actual nuanced and intriguing plotline. Re:zero takes many of the generic plot devices (i.e. Seven Deadly Sins) and symbols and spins it in a way that keeps the watchers hooked. After each arc, more and more of the plot is revealed and shows how deep and involved the conflicts really are even in everyday life for commoners. Every episode is incredibly important in setting up the next one and each detail is important insofar that it comes back or relates to something else. Furthermore, this plot actually deals with and interacts with the characters in a meaningful and realistic manner. Racism and other discriminatory practices are blatantly shown as a primary incentive and impact of many characters. Like the real world, there are everyday conflicts between people and they have consequences. People don't just forget and don't judge in the real world. They do. Re:zero exploits this because often times other shows are unwilling to be bold and accept this truth. 

(Spoilers) As more of the plot is revealed, we begin to see how this story comes full circle a little bit at a time. The mc is here for a reason. Re:zero isn't simply a story about finding love and defeating the bad guys. It's about a story of self-discovery and change. When you see the nuances of the mc and his power Return by Death and how that is actually linked to the witch, the plotline inadvertently  becomes so much more fascinating. Is Subaru actually Pride and a part of the Witch's cult? Will he eventually turn against Emilia? Is Satella simply a manifestation of what is wrong with people? This is the narrative that Re:zero challenges the audience on and that is what makes this show so great. Nothing is as easy as it seems and nothing is safe. 

One thing to note is that during the last episode of the show when Betelguese is chasing down Subaru in the cart, he (Betelguese) says things eerily similar to Subaru. What we see is that while motives can be perceived good or bad by the audience, ultimately every character can be considered rational and relatable. In fact, Betelguese's emphatic love for Satella drives him to carry out her orders and do what he does in the name of love. Similarly, Subaru does the same for Emilia. She is his love and he will do what he thinks benefits her. This interplay and dialogue between the protagonists and antagonists actually reveals a far more intertwined plot line between the protagonists and the antagonists. I would personally love to see a season 2 that develops this even more.

I'm sure there are plenty of other things I can talk about that I'm not mentioning in this review as well as expanding more upon those that I did. But at the end of the day take away three things about the plotline for re:zero

It's engaging, it's nuanced/complex and it's realistic/relatable.

2.) Character Development

Three things I want to talk about in this review: humanism/realism, the cycle of character building and why it's so unique to Re:zero, the impact of dialogue as a mechanism of creating organic change. 

First on humanism and the development of relatable characters. I think what anime in general has a habit of doing especially in the genre that Re:zero falls under is provide a mc as well as supporting characters that is unrealistic (i.e. SAO, Log Horizon etc.). When you do so, you target the classic niche anime community (which hey is a corporate incentive) where typical NEETs can fantasize about. Everyone wants to be overpowered. Everyone wants to get the girl. Everyone wants to be the protagonist and save the world from evil. This isn't realistic. No one is the main character in the world and your actions when you act like one has consequences. People will not simply accept that you are better than them. You need to develop your image and reputation with one of respect and credibility for people to trust you. This is how the world works and this is the basis of how Re:zero operates. I personally believe that many anime are too afraid to challenge the norms and question the very way our reality works. This was a new and refreshing change of pace that ultimately worked effectively.

What does this look like? For the mc, Subaru, I believe that his actions and the way his personality has evolved over the show provides a reasonable picture of what would happen if I were in his shoes.  In the beginning after Emilia shows up, it's very obvious that Subaru believes he is the white knight. He has to save Emilia, win over her love, and save the world. Who wouldn't want to believe that after being transported to a realm that you have no clue about? However, after using his ability Return by Death, we slowly see the darkness that is in every human: fear, savagery, detest, jealousy, envy etc. Death is no simple thing. Often times, anime blows this way out of proportion and simply slides it under the rug. Death goes against every fiber of our living body. We are built to survive and ultimately to help ourselves. 

For every death that Subaru encounters, it slowly erodes his soul and his personality. The first major arc focuses mostly on how Subaru can use his actions to change the future in a ""parallel"" or different world. He learns and adapts quickly to the situation and in fact willing dies to reset. Yet, among this arc we see constant foreshadowing of a deeper problem ingrained in Subaru: his emphatic and sometimes unrealistic devotion to Emilia. In the next arc, we see the beginning of the ""true suffering"" - the development of the ""suffaru."" The 2nd arc primarily deals with the backlash and the psychological damage of dying. At the point where Subaru cannot express any of his emotions and his struggles to anyone in any lifetime, this burden ultimately is too much for one single being. This is realistic. Too many times, do main characters disregard death or their own abilities as inconsequential. They use what they have to change the world around them without actually questioning their motives or their sanity along the way. Re:zero explicitly shows the impact of what happens when a person goes through consistent traumatic experiences and how it affects you. This is what would happen to you if you were Subaru, an ordinary person.

Second on the cycle of character building. As mentioned already, Re:zero specifically focuses on Subaru and how his actions are perceived and interpreted by others. Recognize that Subaru is not the only actor in this world and that everyone else is affected by his supposedly irrational actions. Why are they irrational? Because he cannot talk to anyone about his ability, he has to assume to some degree that they can understand him somehow. There is simply no other way for him to stay sane. He needs to believe that they understand that he is trying to help them without actually conveying it to them. The problem is, is that one when Subaru never talks, no one actually knows his motives and intentions. This is realistic. Second, often times his actions seem irrational because he simply knows more than he should. Why does he want to take Emilia with him to somewhere else? Can she actually trust him? At the point in which Subaru gives no explanation, the only course of action is to psychologically break down. 

This is unique to Re:Zero. By episodes 10-15 roughly, most viewers hate Subaru for what he is becoming. He is becoming a detestable, selfish and loathsome mc which is unappealing to most audiences. However, I see that as a way that the story is challenging the standard narrative in these shows and in reality. Why is the show suddenly so cringeworthy and hard to watch? It's because it breaks down the facade that is society. Everyone puts on a good face but at its core we human beings have dark emotions. When the show explicitly presents us with a realistic adaptation of what would happen in these situations, we must confront ourselves. Are we like that? Or we are not? 

This cycle of building, breaking down characters only to rebuild them and remold them differently is extremely new and refreshing. Most shows take 5 steps forward, 1 step back (usually because of someone's death), and then another 5 steps forward. This doesn't always seem reasonable. At the point which death is probably the most traumatic experience one can have, the average person is probably far more affected than it is  portrayed in most shows. Subaru takes 5 steps forward, each a smaller step, falls and slides down and finally picks himself up again on a different more effective staircase. Overall, Re:zero is probably the only show ever to truly break down a character at its core after building it up a certain way only to remold them into a different person with a similar set of values. This sort of nuance is not any other show I've watched

Finally on to dialogue and why it's so effective in Re:zero. I think in most shows dialogue is rarely used realistically. If the main character is feeling down, generally someone comes up to him, says a few words about how it's not his fault and how he has to believe in himself to keep moving forward. And that's about how they solve any sort of internal crisis. Re:zero doesn't do this. Instead, they take more time in developing interesting and complex arguments that are realistic. During Subaru's breakdown with Emilia, their dialogue is extremely reminiscent of their previous actions. They explain themselves to the best they can just like people would. They understand their own incentives and motives. Putting a band-aid on a break in consciousness does not suddenly fix it. Re:zero resolves these issues in meaningful and realistic ways. The supporting characters are literally there to support the mc (i.e. Rem best girl). Re:zero dedicates almost 2 and a half episodes solely on the recovery of Subaru with the help of Rem. In fact, they spend a whole episode having Subaru talk with Rem over his problems. Their dialogue gets to the real crux of the problem and ultimately resolves the issue. 

Re:zero shows and tells. It shows you why and how people behave when they break and they tell you how you get back up. You don't get back up with a few words and a pat on the back. You get it after you have meaningful and long discussions about the root problems and how to fix it. 

3.)  The voice acting

Plenty of other shows have had exceptional voice acting and Re:Zero is no different. This show has been the only show in my entire life that I have watched both anime and Western tv series that has emotionally charged me to the point of getting chills. I have never resonated so much with anyone else and their struggles.

Yuusuke Kobayashi, the VA for Subaru, is perfect for the role. He exemplifies both the inflection and tone during crucial parts of the show. Particularly, when in episode 7 when Ram kills him and questions ""What have I ever done to you for you to hate me,"" in episode 12 or 13 when Subaru breaks down in front of Emilia, episode 15 when Subaru roars with anger to Betelgeues after he kills Rem, ""I will kill you,"" and finally in episode 18 when he talks to Rem about his feelings. Every scene that should be emotional is emotional because of the actors. Every action and word that should be charged with either sadness or pure anger is done so. 

Particularly Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, the VA for Betelguese, is fantastic. Despite being the mc for a completely different anime Shokugeki no Souma with a completely different taste, he absolutely nails the main arc 3 antagonist. The speed and inflection and the arbitrary emphasis on certain words exemplifies the insanity of Betelguese effectively. Re: zero is definitely not short on excellent VAs and they did an excellent job portraying humanistic elements and emotions in the show

4.) The animation/directing

Unbelievable. White Fox Studio absolutely nailed it. Everyone praises them for adapting the show accurately and it's true. They truly hit the mark on the spot. In fact, many times they were so dedicated in providing the material and the content that they eliminated the opening and ending or even extended the length of the episode to give the viewers the best possible experience. 

The animation is crisp and clean. I think the animators did a fantastic job showing the fight scenes as well as displaying scale (i.e. the White whale). Furthermore, much of the lighting and use of backgrounds is often used to foreshadow or to emphasize the mood of the story. There were no lapses of bad animation quality and it was consistent throughout the show.

Furthermore, the choice of words was super important in the show. When people say words like ""aishiteimasu,"" it has far more meaning than the english sub would make it seem. In english, I love you is pretty the strongest emotional words you can get. In Japanese however, there are many ways to say I love you. In fact, most shows say ""daisuki or ashiteru."" These are much less powerful forms of love in the sense that they are more casual. If you say ""aishiteimasu,"" to someone, you better be breaking out the ring soon. 

When the production studio explicitly uses language as means to achieve a certain understanding, it demonstrates the willingness to go that extra step. White Fox Productions is dedicated to this show and uses any sort of mechanism to further the plot and the characters. In this sense, the directors have a great idea of direction and how to get there in the most effective way possible. 

5.) The Music 

The music in Re:Zero is spectacular. The serious tones during the serious moments as well as the light hearted ones during more cheerful times. One thing that really stuck out was that the show used a variety of different types of music and styles. For example, at the end of episode 15, they use a very beautiful yet solemn elegy for Rem as the credits rolled up on the screen. White Fox was willing to experiment and see what worked and what didn't

Furthermore, they nailed the timing down for when to put music and when not to. The silences were extremely effective at bringing out the suspense and mystery. During around episode 21 and 22 when Subaru and company go off to fight the White Whale, the sound of the 1980s ringtone was incredibly eerily. White Fox productions literally went out and searched for the actual phone type and its ringtone in real-life rather than creating it inside its music production studio. This level of dedication is so unique and is really effective only in Re: zero

At the end of the day, Re:zero comes out to be a unique and refreshing experience. Its complex plot, nuanced characters, and challenge of societal norms provides intelligent discourse and conversations about what it means to be human and how can we be better? With the special attention to animation, directing, acting and music, Re:zero simply nails home the whole package.

Tl;dr watch the show. It's fantastic on all levels."

Re:zero is one of much anime which the protagonist is transported to another world. At first, I thought so, I didn't expect too much for this anime. I thought that, ""Seriously, Isekai again? This is boring!"" but I tried to watch this series because my friend recommended this to me. At first cour, it just like a common anime fantasy, the problem is not that big. It's just like a slice-of-live anime, with shit protagonist. I thought that his ability is cheating, he could revive from dead and change his fate, and I thought that in last, he
                  ...
will suddenly overpowered with power of despair. But then, I was wrong.
The second cour is great, it give me speechless. The problem is too big for him to handle with that weak power that he has, it makes me so curious, what resolution will be, what will he do to fix his situation, hi fails again and again, experiencing despair, and almost run from his situation. But then, the supporting character did her role as it should be. I never think that the first cour would give a very important plot to the story. And then, his resolution give me speechless again. This is so great! I recommend this for you!
Though, the ending haven't completed yet, but it's quite good compared to the cliff hanger ending in another anime adaptation. Well, it's because ... I Love Emilia!!

Firstly here is a brief summary of Re:zero

Re:zero is about male protagonist Natsuki Subaru (voiced by Kobayashi, Yuusuke) who is an 18 year old NEET who gets transported in to another world, (quite a common setting in a majority of anime however with a unique twist) after a visit to the convenience store, he is later saved by a beautiful silver haired elf after being mugged by a group of street thugs, he gets to know his savior who names herself Satella for a bit until they are both killed. However unknowingly Subaru has the ability ""Return
                  ...
by Death"" to go back in time and change the future event from ever happening.

Story(9): Now the story is mainly focused on Subaru attempting to save his savior(Emilia) from dieing and later on helping her achieve her goal however she doesn't really show much gratitude as Subaru is still a kind of stranger to her who she helped when he was in need, nothing more, nothing less, there is isn't a lot of sceentine for Emilia however she us seen quite a bit early on and definitely near the end.
WARNING!
There are many waifu's so be prepared for the MAL salt.

Art(9): The scenary in this anime is amazing in my opinion, every scene is appealing to the eyes and the art is overall spectacular though a few parts may look a bit low near the end due to saving budget for specific scenes but are still not really anything to be salty about.

Sound(10): This is one of my favorites, the music in this especially the OSTS are amazing, they all fit the moment and are perfectly used, the OPs and EDs are catchy and the anime has many soundtracks made just for a moment in the episode and are one of my favorites.

Characters(10): The character development is done very well and you can tell how much the MC, main and quite a few supporting characters grow, this anime focuses quite a bit on the supporting cast which is what i love, especially Whilhem Van Astrea, Felis and Crusch, the voice actors do a magnificent job especially in those emotional scenes, you can really feel the character's pain and suffering, Betelgeuse is the best VA of the year no doubt about that.

Enjoyment(10): I loved this series from start to finish, it did not feel rushed what so ever and i have already rewatched this series 3 times and counting. I would definitely reccomend this anime especially to those who love a dark fantasy thriller setting.
(According to LN readers this is only the prologue 10-15% of the story)
So expect a second season in a few years time.

Overall(10): Personally this have been one of my favorite anime's of all time, everything is done so well and im really impressed at how well the VAs have done, definitely in my top 3 anime of all time.

THIS IS NOT SAME AS SAO WHAT SO EVER!
For the people who relate this masterpiece to trash, i don't know what is the same or how it even feels the same, everything you here about this being a a generic harem with plain characters is all bs from the haters, i recommend ignoring them and for you to personally enjoy it, if you don't fair enough but don't be a troll like the others.

Thanks for reading, let me know if you enjoyed my first review, id be happy to do more."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"Every now and then, we, the anime community, are blessed with a gem.  A gem, shining ever so brightly in the sea of mediocrity that are the seasonal anime manages to blind the majority of the community with its seemingly endless blister into thinking that the title at hand is somehow special and praiseworthy. After a rather short period of time, the bright light the  gem once used to vividly emulate begins to flicker, until eventually fading away into eternal darkness and being forgotten. It's nothing new; rather just a byproduct of hype culture and the negative effect it has on entertainment media.
                  ...
The implementation of various anime databases and platforms like MAL in recent years make the anime medium in particular all the more susceptible to this horrible disease that seemingly spreads like wildfire. And for that reason, I will gladly presume the role of a firefighter. This one'll go in-depth.

Adapted from a rather lacklustre source material, the story revolves around our protagonist, Subaru. When Subaru one day decides to venture out into the wilderness that is the grocery store next door, he is out of nowhere magically transported into an unfamiliar fantasy world. Why / how / who / what was it that teleported him there? He doesn't know. We don't know. No one knows. Literally 2 minutes into the show we are presented with a plot device that sets the entire anime into motion. While definitely a negative, I don't particularly mind too much as it is a problem on a far lesser scale than in say Erased, where the plot device is something integral to the narrative. The rest of the plot is fairly straight-forward. In essence, the main character explores the setting, goes through various scenarios, meets a shit load of cute girls while going through individual arcs, etc. So obviously, it possesses all of the shitty traits that plague each and every light novel in existence, and if there was one thing that all of the people who share my general consensus on the show agree on, it would be on how generic it is. 

As if to counteract its' generic nature, the story constantly puts in a conscious effort to be as unpredictable as possible. It serves as a mostly-consistent source of entertainment and I truly do commend the author for that one. But.. where exactly is the line drawn? While plot twists can do wonders in the heat of the moment, Re:Zero tends to gradually overdose on them, often resulting in a faint sense of redundancy. No series is supposed to be this reliant on shock factor to keep the audience seated but apparently going in with the mentality that each respectful viewer suffers from extreme ADHD is the only way to make it big nowadays. The ""dark"" in the ""dark fantasy"" is emphasized on quite a lot, if not a little too much later on. This seems to be what most fans consider to be the driving force of the show, ultimately setting it apart from the typical light novel adaptation. However, a wise man once said ""A different approach does not guarantee a quality outcome"". The wise man in question happens to be your humble writer, of course.

Various anime in the past have thrived off of their dark element, but it is extremely important that you, as a viewer, are able to differentiate between shows that are completely reliant on constant edge and shows that are able to stand on their own two feet without it. I'm not implying that Re:Zero is completely reliant on its edge.. But yeah, I am. While most of the community seems to find it intensely gripping for some odd reason or another, I found most of the ""dark"" scenes to be outright laughable. This is not because I'm some kind of despicable shounen antagonist who has a preconcieved notion against the very fundamentals of fun, but rather the execution of said scenes being far too comical for their own good. Once in a blue moon I really was able to get invested in some of the grimdark stuff, but for the overwhelming majority it was just me laughing my ass off at the sight of villains that resembled an inflatable tube man outside a used car lot that would wiggle their arms and body around while being EVILLL. 

Something that constantly kept pissing me off is how the anime goes about presenting itself. The rough transitioning between dark and goofy makes it extremely hard to ever get fully immersed into the story as it is both completely off-putting and can easily ruin the mood that was in place just a minute ago. I know not every show can have the godsend that is Puck (the elf, not the furby) to ease things out in dire times but really, they could have tried a bit harder. You've got instances where one second the protagonist is casually talking with someone and not even a full minute afterwards he is frantically running for his life. Or even better, while participating in a deathmatch against one of the deadliest assassins in the land, the characters randomly start throwing jokes and snarky remarks at each other like their current life or death situation is a family picnic. It should be obvious to virtually anyone how something that feels so out of place singlehandedly ruins the tension and intense atmosphere that the show was trying to build up just a mere second ago.

Moving on, I'd like to cover what I consider to easily be the biggest problem of Re:Zero. While I could hardly fault a show for having crazy powers in a setting that is entirely reliant on the supernatural, time resets are one of the absolute worst writing tricks in history. ""Return by Death"", ignoring the lack of creativity within the name itself, is by no means an exception - Granting Subaru the ability to go back in time whenever he is killed AKA basically giving him a free checkpoint, returning him to the moment that suits him the most before the time of his death. In Re:Zero, it feels like this trick is implemented whenever the writer comes to the realization that the story is incredibly reliant and dry without it, and so time is reset. It's not a bad thing to spice things up every once in a while but chances are that it's either going to be Subaru constantly going back in time before everything was fucked and starting all over again from step 1 or have the said conflict be resolved by sleazy plot conveniences. ""Oh Roswaal-sama, I didn't see you there! How mighty convenient it is that you have arrived at just the perfect time to evaporate the gigantic demon-dog from the underworld that was about to devour my flesh in the span of two seconds!"" It kinda makes you wonder if the concept of good writing is really such a mysterious term to the people who write light novels.

Return by Death also works as a double-edged sword in the case of Re:Zero. I am taking into consideration the fact that when executed properly, it allows for a fair number of interesting scenarios to play out throughout the series which is something that shouldn't be dismissed. Putting that aside, it is almost guaranteed that the implementation of time resets will deal a heavy blow to any cast of characters that are unaffected by this phenomenon. By having the protagonist and the protagonist only be able to utilize this ability renders the development of the rest of the cast completely null and void, seeing as he will be the only person to retain his memories from the previous iterations. It sacrifices the very fundamentals of characterization while completely throwing the concept of development out of the window for anyone besides him and is the sole reason that stories which rely on time resets have difficulty reaching critical acclaim. I can literally think of a single instance in anime in which time resets are utilized successfully but I don't see Yuasa Masaaki's name under the staff section.

Lastly, it brings up several plot threads for a brief period of time before lightly shrugging them under the rug whenever it so pleases, as if they had never existed. While not inherently plotholes, they almost feel like inconsistencies within the overarching narrative and I'm not sure if they are ever explained in the novel, but briefly covering them in the anime and never touching upon them ever again is completely pointless and a waste of time. Stuff like: Does Return by Death have the ability to take effect on others around Subaru or did Emilia just suffocate to death from the peer pressure of his hug? There are also huge inconsitincies within the world's functions, which have no backbone to sit on as the theory behind them is completely amiss. Stuff like: What was it that triggered Subaru's transportation? Will we ever be given proper information on Return by Death? - ""But is explained in da light novEL! ! !"" is not a valid argument, sorry. It's also worth noting how inconsistent the story is in terms of quality between its individual arcs, namely with the final act of the series being utterly ludicrous in the worst way possible.

Through a long and careful process of deduction, I have come to the conclusion that to be a character of Re:Zero, you must poses at least one of the three mandatory traits. The traits in question are as follows:

Be able to appeal to the otaku audience in one way or another ✔
Be an easy to hate, psychopathic piece of shit ✔
Lean towards borderline insanity ✔

This lot can be applied to absolutely any character in the series, from Subaru to Puck with few and far in between. And what better way to start this section off than with the man who encompasses all three? 

Subaru is the very definition of a hit or miss main character. It’s not hard to decipher that at his very core, he is a self-insert who was brought into existence solely as a means of identification with your average basement-dweller, which is hardly surprising considering that this is a light novel adaptation. But while he does seem to inherit the “Nihilistic shut-in protagonist who’s actually a really nice guy on the inside” trait, he surprisingly has a few quirks of his own. In my eyes, he started off as the most hateable cunt in the known universe (Orange still hadn’t aired at this point) but as the series progressed, I was to my bewilderment able to actually empathize with his character. With that in mind, it still took all I had in order to watch most of his normal interactions with the rest of the cast when he was in his right mind so it really was a breath of fresh air when he went absolutely bonkers and stopped talking altogether. Of course this only lasted for a single episode because as we know, anime protagonists are immune to petty mental disorders. It took Kirito a year to overcome PTSD yet it only took Subaru an episode to recover his sanity. Talk about a hero!

Emilia, while supposedly being the main heroine of the story as well as Subaru’s primary love interest is a fairly mysterious figure throughout pretty much the entirety of the show. For some reason, she physically embodies the appearance of the Jealous Witch that is known and feared by citizens all across the land and unbeknownst to Subaru also happens to be one of the candidates for the throne. Her other attributes consist of being strangely sympathetic towards people she has never met before, having a pet furby and being fairly cute. That right there about fully sums up her character which is quite unfortunate as she's supposed to be the main heroine as opposed to being a side hoe, completely overshadowed by Rem.

""Only I'm allowed to sniff Subaru-kun!"" Rem is first introduced as one of the 2 maids that govern Roswaal’s mansion. When Subaru is hurt and taken to the mansion, she’s appointed as his caretaker along with her older sister, Ram. She initially seems like a cute and innocent girl up until her psychopathic tendencies come rocking in and she brutally murders Subaru in cold blood without giving it a second thought. No one really seems to take that into consideration when labeling her to be the best gurl of da century but it is what it is. Unfortunately, she’s probably the character on which the time resets took the biggest toll on as a huge chunk of her development was constantly being thrown out the window during the entirety of the mansion arc. This takes effect up until the premise of her entire character shifts to being Subaru's lovey-dovey, 2nd-rate love interest during the latter half of the series. Despite that, she still manages to take the cake for the best girl of the series due to an extreme lack of competition.

Produced by studio White Fox, the art and animation really don't present anything new to the table. Although, one thing that sticks out in my mind is how well they were able to handle the tonal shifts the show makes regularly, most notably by effectively switching up the color palette from the usual bright and cheery NGNL-ish style to a more dark and brooding one. The character designs don't have a distinct style but do include a lot of variety between the individual characters. Subaru is noticeably plain-looking and dull, while the citizens that inhabit the fantasy world come off as flashy, with bright clothes and hair in every color imaginable, almost serving as to further alienate Subaru from the norm.

If Re:Zero had a strong suit, it certainly wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it lies within its music department. Despite the fact that like any other sensible man on this god-forsaken Earth, I proudly despise pop music with every fiber of my being, both of Re:Zero's ending and opening songs are admittedly catchy with a handful of decent OSTs to the side. While varied, the voice acting was pretty consistent throughout and most of the seiyuu were able to kick their game up a notch whenever shit hit the fan. Nonetheless, there are still some performances that either managed to evoke mixed feelings or just left a lot to be desired, with Petelguese being the prime example. Episode 15 felt like a comedy skit due to his constant laughter and overly-exaggerated mannerisms, killing any possible tension. Additionally, there's a scene in particular where he is just frantically laughing while the camera slowly zooms-in on Subaru's depraved expression as he screams and drools all over himself.. What? I realize that scene alone tops 95% of comedy anime out there but was that really all it took to boost it into the top 30? Not to mention how all of his lackeys from the Witch Cult also share his exaggerated tone, making the so-called ""antagonists"" of the show practically intolerable.

Re:Zero to me is one of those series you can't help but enjoy no matter which side of the spectrum you've landed on. Even if you don't genuinely like the show, you can still get somewhat of a kick out of it for a variety of reasons. Because the paragraph I wrote looked extremely messy, I've summarized it in good ol' Rkpandey fashion (vote-bots are still in development, though):

Pros:

+ Semi-thriller
+ Subaru offing himself
+ Subaru getting killed
+ Overblown scenes and performances (enjoyable for all the wrong reasons)
+ Inflatable tube man

Cons:

-  Extremely repetitive plot-twists
-  Generic
- Subaru
- Character caricatures
- Subaru
- Laughable antagonists (not a positive)
- Subaru

Nothing is worse than an over-inflated sense of self-importance.

I don't expect nor want any diehard fans of this show to agree with me. The sole reason behind this review's existence is that you lot can hopefully understand where me and many others are coming from when thinking that Re:Zero is in fact not the second coming of Christ, as that is the best I can hope for when going against the norm like this. So in conclusion: Re:Zero is a torture-porn, flavor of the month show with an uninteresting cast and a bland, oversaturated premise far too reliant on constant plot twists in order to keep the viewer seated even after long passing the point of redundancy. It does a few things right and does try to deviate from the typical light novel adaptation by adding heavy emphasis on the dark fantasy setting it establishes early on. Unfortunately, most of these scenes are either too comical or far too overblown to be taken seriously and it holds no merit when compared to other dark fantasy anime like Berserk. On the other hand, the thriller appeal is still somewhat there until it goes off the rails during the last act and even then I'd be lying by saying I wasn't entertained while marathoning through the whole ordeal, albeit for all the wrong reasons."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Not Recommended,"Re:Zero- A Lengthy Yet Critical Dissertation

Well, I told myself I wouldn't review this, but I felt so disgusted while reading through the reviews of Re:Zero on MAL that I had to address the glaringly obvious issues with it. I binged 23 of its 25 episodes while sick at home with the flu, and by the end of it I'm not sure if that or the vomiting I did was worse. I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with this review, but I plead for you to take off your fan service blinders and tune in while I break down the psychological disaster
                  ...
Re:Zero truly is.

In essence, Re:Zero is a deconstruction of the fantasy/stuck in game genre, one I've never particularly been a fan of. Our ""noble"" protagonist, Subaru is magically transported to a mystical world where time travel is commonplace, the MC activates God Mode and chicks are all over his nether regions. Sound familiar? I decided to start the series based on a friend's recommendation that it was like Steins;Gate. I will tell you from personal experience that the biggest similarity between the two is the existence of a punctuation mark in their two titles. That or the fact they're the same amount of episodes. For the remaining episodes, writers cater to the libidos of pathetic teenagers by combining the worst elements of shows like Sword Art Online and other overpowered harem titles and do a fantastic job evading any responsibility developing intelligent plot lines. Non-cohesive potholes are disguised as ""psychological"" or ""edgy"" and the main character whines continuously like a three year old who lost his balloon.

One of the most notorious blemishes on Re:Zero's resume is the messy shifts its tone makes. It's one thing for a show to be edgy, but when there's no legitimate segway between a slapstick joke and an emotional gut punch, it leaves the viewer confused. Bunguo Stray Dogs has this same issue, which ends up making neither the comedy funny or the shocks effective. It's like watching someone comically slip on a banana peel cut short by an image of puppies being boiled in acid. That's not edgy, it's just a fucking disaster. It's feasible for a show to contain multiple genres, but they must be developed with finesse or else the viewer is left watching the equivalent of a bipolar teen not knowing what they want to be in life. The unfortunate part is how the majority of viewers are so desensitized to this streamlined method of script writing that it seems normal and acceptable. The writers could've benefitted from watching shows like Steins;Gate and HunterXHunter in order to learn how to effectively balance humor with serious or cerebral scenes.

The rest of the story seems as though it's being written week to week. Instead of taking the time to carve out an effective story, writers use sporadic shock value to trick the viewer into thinking what they're watching is good. Their adrenaline is pumping, and it almost creates a sense of tunnel vision in order to distract them from the real issues the anime has. Shows like Game of Thrones have shock value as well, but the superb writing, effective timing and added characterization separates it from phonies like Re:Zero. Unfortunately, unlike other shock and awe disasters like Akame ga Kill, Re:Zero fans will defend these contrived elements because of the time resets and other excusable aspects of the series. In that respect, the director achieved his goal of pure entertainment value. It appeals to the masses. I, like anyone enjoys a good cliffhanger from time to time. However, Re:Zero gives The Walking Dead a run for its money in the sheer amount of forced close-calls in its episode conclusions. It gets incredibly annoying if you're bingeing it, just like one of my few issues with Kaiji.

Initially I thought the time-resetting element could be incorporated effectively into the already entertaining first 3 episodes of the series. I was dead wrong. This aspect ends up existing as little more than a plot device to excuse weak writing and character development. Subaru screws up, doesn't atone for his mistakes and tries again a different way. I get that this takes place in a fantasy world, but what is the viewer learning from a kid that cries about ""they didn't do what I wanted them to do! Wahhhhh!"" He shows little to no respect for the world he gets transported to, and instead of learning from his errors, repeats them with somebody or something else. Since he's still a kid, this exists again as a cop out for writing legitimate character growth throughout the series. However, he probably acts close to how many other people his age would if they were thrown into a supposed ""game-like"" world... With blatant disregard to everything around them. In some ways, the writers really put off a pretentious vibe for the lack of responsibility Subaru has in his actions. It left a bad taste in my mouth and seemed as though they were sticking their tongues out at critics everywhere like ""I'm writing this and there's nothing you can do about it, nah!""

Of course, Re:Zero offers a plethora of eligible waifus to choose from. There's the emotional shy one, the lolli, the yandere and everything in between. Not to mention, they all end up falling for Subaru in the end. It IS 2016 people, recycling the same harem formula with duplicated generic tropes for characters got old about 20 years ago. No character in the entire show, sans our antagonist, is unforgettable, unless you're speaking from purely lusting reasons. Every time a new female character was introduced it felt like another nail in Re:Zero's coffin of legitimacy. Character development isn't formed from generating multiple cardboard-cutouts and assigning them to becoming romantically involved with our MC. Regardless of what you think you're interpreting as development, it all exists as a facade to promote its narrative... whatever that may be.

But what about our Lord and Savior, Subaru???

One important piece of a television series that can make or break a viewer's experience, is the ability for us to relate to facets of a character's personality or their cause for actions in the world. Unfortunately, Subaru exhibits neither of these. Throughout Re:Zero's painstaking 25 episodes he learns virtually nothing about his previous mistakes, and his actions towards other characters are unjustifiable or entirely belligerent. He disrespects others in the world, and thinks the best way to fix his blunders is to just rewind time again. If only it were that easy. Unfortunately, not enough intelligence exists on this planet for anyone to call him out for being an idiot. Everyone just goes along with his irritating behavior because he's an ""outsider"". Some would be quick to call Subaru a selfless ""hero"", but he blindly helps strangers he's known for about five minutes. This clearly isn't a reflection of his personality, but is out of character and exists to propel the story forward. He's helping people because ""he's supposed to"" and continuously bites the hand that feeds him, and always seems to come out scott free. He's an oblivious moron lacking any bit of hindsight, but it's alright because he ultimately gets all the chicks, and that's all that matters right?

Whew, now that I'm completely out of breath I can mention the few positives I can take from Re:Zero. In no particular order:

1. The animation is pretty damn good. It reminds me a lot of No Game No Life with regard to the vivid, bright colored environments and attractive character models. White Fox at its finest
2. The premise is great. Execution is abysmal, but at least I can ponder about what could've been.
3. It's oddly entertaining at times, if for no other reason than to watch a train wreck in progress. 
4. The laundry list of waifus ensure that all plebs can be satisfied. Most of the female characters are oddly sexy in their own way.
5. The soundtrack is consistent, pleasant and well mixed. I mean, it damn well better be based on the composer's credentials.

There, I did it. Parts of me are baffled as to how this is the 35th highest rated show on MAL as this review is completed, but after the giant Erased debacle from a few seasons ago nothing really surprises me anymore. I hope at least those individuals deliberating on whether or not to watch Re:Zero have gained some valuable information in this review. Don't be so easily deceived, use your head when you watch it.

All in all, while I'm disappointed that this is the same studio that put out gems like Steins;Gate and Katanagatari, I'm not that surprised. The director and writers successfully catered to the mass appeal of shock and awe as well as shameless fan service when they wrote Re:Zero. The writing is shit and the characters suck, but I guess if you're looking for a cheap thrill or to be hip with your fellow weeaboos, you might consider watching this pompous piece of fiction. Thanks for those who pushed me to write this review, I had a lot of (cough) ""fun"" reliving my sickness in order to produce this critical analysis. Be sure to check out the rest of my Summer '16 reviews!"

I can agree that the show has an interesting premise and tries it best to be something original but in most episodes it seems like the writer itself doesn't really know where to take the story.  Subaru is just transported into this fantasy world and immediately accepts it without ever questioning where or how he got here or even try to at least get back to his own world. The characters are simply one-dimensional and have no personality at all and just seem like lifeless robots who are simply their to complete the harem circle. The reasons
                  ...
Subaru does things is simply illogical. The two maids are simply there for fan service and serve nothing to the plot at all except being ""waifu"" material. The relationship between Subaru and Emilia felt fake and forced to be honest and in my eyes don't really see why he even likes her as it doesn't feel genuine .This series could have had great potential but after the ending it was pure trash and i don't understand how anyone calls this a masterpiece. The last episode felt disappointing and felt like many things were missing like some characters were completely tossed on the side. Overall this show is a mess with a cast of bland characters and a weird main character with no intelligence."

So basically in the beginning : A character named Natsuki Subaru went on a new Fantasy world, containing powers, a medieval and lovely place. Buying some stuffed at a market by blinking his eyes in the real world,more precisely in Japan was his traveled method. After failing miserably by trying to save someone, Subaru finally understood that he didn't possess any power at all... That what he though on the beginning. A torturous loop happen again and again where he died, after finally founding happiness and a beautiful girl who saved her,
                  ...
and Subaru understand after his second death that he possess not really a power,but instead a curse : Return by Death. 

Subaru as a neet still possess a huge strength in hand combats, letting him kicking the ass of three street thugs, wearing a huge weapons and also act really fast on his feet, which means he is not fully hopeless. He also possess some courage, but broke up after some dramatic death and it's totally under-stable.

So, this story will showed you a new and more serious Kono suba !

So, do you like watching the main character suffering and growing up? 
Do you like amazing music ? Amazing opening and ending ?
Do you like comedy? Do you like Tragedy? Do you like crying and feeling happy after watching a episode ? Then, Re:Zero is for you.

Story : 8/10

The Story is interesting, but could have been explained better. It's still have some great plot twist, and the cliffhanger are ALWAYS present.
Some awesome scene were skipped from the Light novel, which i don't understand why. Maybe because they doesn't had enough time ? But still. It's really a shame for me.

Art : 8/10

The art is good, but some scenes possess too much camera shaking, which reduce the enjoyment i had.

Otherwise, i also like the design of each character, and the CGI made the world around alive. The flashback were also really well place in each scene, and some face of Subaru are so well drawn when he goes wrong, you really feel disturb when need by watching it.

Unfortunately, the last episode of the series were becoming worse with the arts, maybe because they were starting to lack of budget and time. But it was still great overall !

Sound : 10/10

The sound was really something wonderful and powerful. It's the typical music that bring you tears of joy, and put some tingles on your back. The track of Re:Zero could even reach some level of music movies !


Character : 10/10

Oh god, the Character are soooo amazing ! I love them all so much. They all have something interesting that i like. 

Natsuki Subaru : Oh god, his voice. Some people find him annoying, but i love hearing him. The voice actor put and awesome job on him.

Also, Natsuki Subaru always changed and surprised me.

Well, i find all voice in this show really good, thumbs up for all the voice actor !

Enjoyment : 10/10

When i'm watching and anime and realizing that i have to wait one more week to see another episode, it's mean for me that i really enjoyed this.

Everything was well done perfectly to make me enjoyed more and more each episode, White fox did and awesome job.

Like i said before, the cliffhanger are always present, along with amazing soundtrack. I feel hype at every episode !


Overall : 10/10

It was a great surprise, and i don't regret watching it even with the negative comment about it.

This show is truly a masterpiece for me, and nobody can make me change my though about it. It's true that it contain some lack, but overall it doesn't matter for me. One of the best anime that i watched.

Everybody rating it shit are of course some people who doesn't watch it seriously and though it was a harem by looking at the main picture, it's truly a shame."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=2,Recommended,"So, I've noticed the many hateful reviews given to this anime. Despite its magnificence, many are hating on it. Some of these reviews seem to be written just for likes, and others just for trolling. I will attempt to make this review something that will truly evaluate this animated story of Re:Zero.

WARNING- may contain minor spoilers

Story- 10

The story is very simple: The protagonist wants to save people from death. In doing so, he dies, but reincarnates himself upon failure. So, what is it that makes this memorable? Answering that would be a spoiler, but the best way to describe it is failure. Everyone experiences failure.
                  ...
You, me, the guy down the street, and especially Subaru. he gets a failure stamp on his back as he continues to struggle, to fail, to try, and to destroy himself over and over and over again. In doing so, he kills himself, no longer being motivated by saving, but by desperation. He displays the average human among the beasts, magicians, and demons in his world. It also shows what would truly happen to a human in a different world. Many anime play this off by giving the protagonist a powerful sidekick, a ""special power"", a weapon, or luck(looking at you Konosuba.) The anime gives the protagonist ABSOLUTELY nothing. That is, if you forget the reincarnation. Even then, reincarnation doesn't help his survivability, it just gives you another chance, like a video game. When you lose in a video game, it doesn't give you cheat codes, or weapons, or the power of friendship. It just gives you the option to retry. But, when ignoring reincarnation, it gives nothing, takes everything, and kills your dreams of living in a parallel world in a realistic way.

Art/Sound- 9

These to are mainly put together because they shouldn't be the main focus of anime. The main focus should be the story. Art and sound should only be there to support, not to be a major category. 

That said, the art and sound are great. The openings and endings fit perfectly to the anime's theme, and the soundtrack also fits well. the artwork had a few flaws, such as some parts being in 3D instead of being animated. HOWEVER, that happens once every 10 episodes. It's a flaw, but an extremely small one. In conclusion, the art and sound both fit the anime like sidekicks fit to main characters.

Characters- 9

The characters all work well with the story. Subaru, the main character, almost displays a human perfectly. He has flaws, goes for girls, occasionally acts weird, and has flaws. Did I mention he has flaws. Well, he has flaws. Subaru isn't perfect, which is very refreshing when watching other anime. Most of the time, protagonists are special, where either their physicality, combat ability, perception, or anything else is top notch. Almost all anime protagonists have a top-notch skill or ability. Not Subaru. He isn't special, and could be replaced by many other males from earth. He might be strong, but punches don't work on magic. He may be enthusiastic, but enthusiasm doesn't help him. He may be the protagonist, but that doesn't mean he gets special attention. He's normal. He's average. That's what makes him special.

Emilia was created out of an ideal. She was created out of other waifus to be the ultimate waifu. She's nice, strong(but not too strong) and perfect. Everyone would love her as a girlfriend. Despite this, everyone hats her because of her resemblance to someone else. That shows realism, because most anime have a completely perfect character. This anime shows that perfection could be the cause of imperfection.

Rem should not be listed as a side character. Although she is the ultimate support character, she has almost as many, if not more lines than Emilia, and should've been the main girl in many people's perspective. Rem is also strong, nice, and beautiful, but is stuck as a maid, caring for and looking after the other characters. Yet another case of amazingness lessened because of something realistic. Missed opportunity. Or, opportunities never given to her. Another case of realistic tragedy.

All other characters are basic supports. Rem's sister, Ram, Puck, the apple man, felt, Julis, Feliz, the other crown contendors, and the list goes on and on. they all have something in them that's memorable. I am really bad with names, yet I doubt I will forget anyone here.

Enjoyment-  10

I don't have to explain myself. This review does it for me. Re:Zero is incredible, and you should watch it.

Overall- Just watch it

Just watch it."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"Re:Zero is not for the faint-hearted. This is a warning. The show is incredible, one of the best I have come across. But it is deceptively grim and dark. Despair is not a foreign concept here. Re zero seemingly promised a light-hearted adventure anime that bore a striking resemblance to Konosuba but then it did something I have never seen an anime do before. It took firm hold of my heartstrings and yanked them in opposite directions. It effectively ripped apart my expectations, and my heart along with them.

Story:
The story starts off with a similar note to Konosuba, a NEET that gets thrown into a
                  ...
medieval-based RPG world. His expectations of grandeur and power belonging to the typical protagonist gets dashed and by chance, he finds a companion. Then the time travel aspect gets introduced and the story starts to spiral down into the darkness. Yes, a major point of the show is that Subaru can die and can return to a certain point in time, sort of like a save point. This travel premise allows Subaru to try over and over again if he fails and this might seem like a ridiculously great advantage. It isn’t as great as it seems. The ordeals that Subaru goes through are shockingly dark. Depressingly dark. We get to see Subaru fight and struggle over and over again until your heart breaks for the poor guy. There were times that I had wondered why Subaru didn’t just break down right there and then. When Subaru finally triumphs over the depressing dead ends, there is the feeling of relief and satisfaction. The hero finally gets what he deserves. And then suddenly, you realized that you are emotionally attached to the characters. 

Characters:
Re zero has an interesting cast with their own engaging back stories and character. But to avoid spoilers, I will just be focusing on the mc. 
Subaru is one of the most realistic characters I have ever seen. Just like in reality, this character has his strengths as well as his weaknesses, successes as well as failures. And his flaws are portrayed exceptionally well. You can admire that kindness, determination and courage in him. But the show also ensures awareness of the stubbornness, arrogance and neediness in him. We get to see the ugly side of Subaru, his desperate need to feel needed, that undeserved pride and an irritating sense of pettiness among other things. His cringe-worthy flaws disgusted me at times but I stuck around. It was worth it. This character is worth the watch. He fights, gets the world pulled from under his feet and then he struggles again, all the time harboring thoughts and emotions that were relatable to, especially the negative ones. Subaru isn’t a perfect character and neither is he a strong one, but his life-like human qualities make him a character that you will remember whether you like him or not.

Animation and sound:
The animation is worthy of a 2016 anime and is aesthetically pleasing. But the soundtrack is the more noteworthy aspect of the show. The thing that I noticed was that it was extremely suitable. At the times when you were supposed to feel the character's joy or dejection, the soundtrack created the perfect atmosphere for that particular emotion. With impressive visuals, background music that is pleasing to the ears and a complementing atmosphere, what is not to like?

Enjoyment:
I enjoyed the experience, even if it wasn’t exactly a pleasant one throughout. It is an emotional rollercoaster and should be taken as such. The story takes the characters that you feel for then wrenches your heart as they suffer horribly. But it also takes the characters that you feel for and gives them their happiest moments as you watch with satisfaction from afar. It has highs and lows. Extreme ones. That is what makes the ride engaging and enjoyable.

Overall:
Re zero has definitely earned a place on my favorites list, the list of anime that I will never forget amongst the easily forgettable sea of generic shows. If you are looking for a masterpiece of a ride then congratulations, you have found one. But it isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, despair and gore come along as a package. If you can get around that point, then you have found yourself a rare gem. To be honest, the show was something like a guilty pleasure for me. I had told myself to exercise a bit of discipline and wait for the entire series to be out before watching. But I couldn’t deny my curiosity and binged watched an entire 22 episodes in a day. That is just how captivating and alluring the series is. Don’t just take my word for it, give it a shot. (At least until episode 15. By that point, you’d probably get a gist of what the show is like.) I hope that watching Re zero will be as great an experience for you as it was for me. I was knocked off my feet."

review MIGHT contain spoilers, I won't include any major spoilers BUT I will talk about characters for example that don't appear
ep 1!


So when I started Re:Zero I was amazed, I loved this anime from first sight, it ticked all the boxes now let me first talk about
the main character: subaru

Now one thing I have to point out is that when you start watching you may at first call this a Harem garbage anime, I don't think
so (more on
                  ...
that later)

ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER!
Subaru is the protagonist of Re:Zero, he is usually the weakest and is bad at doing anything, but he has a strong will and is
ready to give everything he has for the ones he cares about... He will try again and again... Subaru really had lots of 
development through the series, usually there is zero progression in any anime but this anime really managed to develop not only
the main character... ok so many might say ""oh subaru is so annoying"", but I guess that is personal taste, I think he is
something diffrent from your usual protagonist but you might not think so... I do have to say he does some stupid stuff and
you will probably sit there and think ""why the fu** did he just do that?"" But he fixes everything in the end and his stupid
stuff wasn't actually that stupid...

IS IT HAREM?
now I know many people say that this anime is just a harem THAT IS NOT TRUE(!) while yes, almost EVERY 2. Main Character is
female this anime IS NOT harem, almost all females have ZERO intrest in him and rather hate him... So NO harem here! also the
anime drifts to only subaru after a while so he has his stuff going on but no harem, sorry

IS IT JUST TIME RESET CRA*?
NO it is not! While there are a lot of time resets these ALL have part in the story! They also have a giant impact in Subarus
actions and overall personality! Also it doesn't get reptitive, they really did a good job making sure it always stayed
interesting!

HOW CONFUSING IS THE STORY?
Now the story is kinda confusing, after some time you might wonder what timeline we are in now and what had actually happend,
but not necessarialy, they did a good job making sure you can follow the story and keep in mind what had happend in that timeline
...

IS IT FUN?
Yes

IS IT CONFUSING? (IS IT TO FAST/SLOW?)
Not really, it manages to get a nice pasing so it doesn't get to fast or to slow and it doesn't get to slow!

SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?
Yes definitly!


Story: 10/10
The story is very well though, actions have consequences and it was very well though out!

Animation: 10/10
The animation is very good with a very nice artstyle

Sound: 10/10
The sound is a VERY crucial part of this anime, dramatic music, no sound as times of fear and very good voice actors!

Character: 10/10
The Characters are a very crucial part of this anime, everyone from the apple seller to the main protagonist have unique
personality's! The Characters develop during the series and all have a very nice design! They also all serve another purpose
then ""here is a characters he is just here to fill up space""...

Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed this anime A LOT, I must say that it is my probably favorite anime of 2016, maybe even of all time
and that says A LOT! Make sure to definitly watch it, its up on crunchroll (support the creators!)

Hope you liked my review... :I

btw the ending was good"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story: 10/10
The story begins with Subaru (yes, a car), who has a NEET life. He is magically transported to a different world, and this is when the adventure begins. Since Subaru is a regular man in a fantasy world, he has no power but the persuasion of his speech to get him out of situations. Later on, he does acquire powerful assets to help him in his journey. The 1st arc of the story is heavily character developed for the cast, and the 2nd arc is Subaru's quest to
                  ...
get his life under control, and how he himself develops as a character.

Art: 9/10
There were some magical scenes that moved me. I didn't feel this feeling since Clannad or Plastic Memories. Other than the magical scenes, the art is really well done, as it is detailed and enough art is presented each episode, so we don't see a million things on screen.

Sound: 10/10
Re:Zero potentially has the best music in anime ever. The opening gets you hyped, and at the end of the episodes the ending just makes you feel connected to Subaru. The insert songs that they played also just fit right in the episodes. They chose the perfect timing for the minute they start the song. This is the highest 10 I would give out of the others, because the sound fits the show no matter what situation it is.

Character: 10/10
You meet plenty of characters, some are shown for a bit then ignored for a while as well. The main focus of the show is Subaru's personality, and how his perspective on life changes every episode. We also see 2 other characters develop their personality in detail as well, as they express their feelings and ideas to the audience's perspective.

Enjoyment: 10/10
I began watching this show when episode 18 came out. I picked the right time to start watching this, as I couldn't wait for every Sunday after that. I was hyped as the opening plays, and anxious when the ending played. This show is a must binge watch. There is no way you can take this show slowly, as it grabs your attention with every episode.

Overall: 10/10
Re:Zero is my Anime of the Year for 2016, as it had truly the best sound, and made me hyped for this show since episode 18. Here is to hope for season 2!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"We can clearly see that the anime focuses more on the characters interaction, character development, showcasing post-traumatic stress disorder in our MC, themes of character flaws and realization of the reality, psychological stress, deception in motives of a person, distrust in one another, and exposition to the world that our MC resides in (talking about its system, beliefs, or existing group of individuals) - And well, that exposition part is probably one of the things that cause some to find this anime boring af. And I'm not going to lie. The fucking long ass episode 0 was not only shit and time consuming (because we
                  ...
all have already assumed that this setting is generic and we know exactly how it's going to prolly work), some of the early episodes are as well (excluding the anime's break from those intensities that Re-zero has to offers by showing a more calming, friendly, or even more reassuring scenes). This anime basically follow in the path of a slice of life kinda setting in an anime that have an adventurous setting that's not supposed to spend that much time on it. But why did I compare a slice of life anime to a horror, sad, savage, and fucking anime that based their story on dark fantasies? Because Re-zero spends more than 16 fucking episode for the MC to realises that his flaws and his selfish desires are delusional in the process of achieving his ideal goal (saving his white hair waifu, and em ladies). And that's why he's so easy to be manipulated by others, or even being treated as a kid, rather than a grown up, matured, and experienced person in life and in an environment filled with responsibility and duty. And this anime has really portrayed it really well unlike many shows that I have personally seen. And that's like 100+ of them. 

And what do those kinds of slice of life anime have in common to this one? Yes, they spend most of their earliest episode, throughout half of the series on character development, representing each of the character's flaws, building up a relationship and so forth. That's the author's way of writing his stories, and it's pretty innovative when he applies it to a dark generic story about a weak hero trying to protect someone. But some may not like this kind of writing style if you're one of those people who overvalue one's beliefs over another. When you know exactly that these ideas are never to be confused with an apodictic truth, or an absolute one. But hey, the anime did pick it up its intensities after those expositions have been over with, and when Subaru finally made it into the mansion. And some may be mentioned that the setting of doing everything all over again from the start, because of some random death is a pretty lame ass facet to stagnate the plot line, and the story progression. But have you ever heard of an anime that's trying to input the realism of this scenario in any anime other than Stein;gate? Well, they're different anime, Stein;gate has to deals with paradoxes and cheating universal laws to repeat the MC's horrible mistakes and to the very end in a temporary good end before the near dark future.

But Re:zero's application was more of a video game, rather than actually dealing with those paradoxical shit. So it may seem similar to any of those time travel anime. But for this case, Re:zero have absolutely nothing to do with any of that shit. Since checkpoints in this anime are more video game logic depended, than it's following a time travel logic of space and time. 

And now some may question, ""does the conversation that Subaru have with anyone in this story pointless?"" Most of their dialogue is consists of Subaru trying to gain trust from the maids (by having a conversation or spending time together), being lecture by experienced people about the responsibility (Crusch and all of the other ones) and the hard work that's required to mature, or to know exactly what's it that you desire for sure (in this case, I wanna kill someone because I hate them, so I will use an excuse of wanting to protect someone just to get that achieved). I personally never sees their conversation as  being""pointless"" when this anime is nothing like one of those typical slices of life anime. And I personally feel strongly that the idea of debasing an anime by calling it out as being ""cliche"" is one heck of an ignorant thing to say. All Hollywood movies I have seen follow the same cliche, and typical plot structure, setting, themes, and even the fucking characters (like that 1 dude that fight against 1000 dudes with a machine gun and rekt em all somehow). Including any other animes out there. 

But all of that aside, I'll have to admit that I was not really a big fan of this anime while watching the beginning of the episodes. But for some reason, I was able to watch it through because of the unique characters that some may call them as ""bland"" when they're fucking weird as fuck with their attires, personality, voice acting and shit lmao. I don't even know what's your definition of bland anymore if you asserted that these kinds of anime character in this show is in fact is. 

Take for instances, Emilia, the girl who will put you in her friendzone even if you're trying to imply that you love her with a very clear indication of it, wanting to spend time with her by wanting to go on a date, or even trying to flatter her with all your might. Rem and Ram, the two maids within this fantasy world that I haven't seen at all I any anime that have those kinds of maid like characters in any fantasies anime. There may be, but it's not as typical for a fantasy RPG like setting to have. And I could go on and on here. But you get my point.

This anime isn't bad at all. I personally fall in love with a lot of characters within the show (aside from fucking SUBARU OF FUCKING COURSE). And the reasons for those pretentious, sounding characters to sound so fucking pretentious to you is because you haven't actually acknowledged that person, or that character, or possibly anyone without the proper status for you to take them seriously. And that's normal. But most of that pretentious behavior from em support characters are meant to say shit to make Subaru realises his flaws, his misconception of selfish desires over protecting someone, being a sore loser like the attitude that should be fixed. And Subaru is dense and deluded as fuck too. So it took him like 16 episodes for that to get him to turn into a mentally strong MC, that's powerless. While isn't all that strange because I have met someone like that in real life before. Even on the fucking internet lmao. 

All of that aside, Subaru is more of a general, tactician, or leader; rather than your typical super powerful, friendship like power kinda MC that protects and out power everyone in the show. But really, this anime is pretty good later on after a couple of boring episodes explaining the setting, MC falling in love with the heavenly beautiful dream elf girl, character interactions (which is still kinda fun to see) and so forth. But this anime is fucking entertaining man. And they show didn't use violence for the sake of violence btw. It's just to show that death is a terrifying thing, and that's why our MC will not kill himself off just to redo every single mistake that he makes. just to show some realism into the show itself. Or just to make our MC to finally give in to the realisation that he's weak af, and he should fucking embrace it like a man and grow the fuck up. But nonetheless, the artwork looks pretty cool, detailed, and em background art is amazing. The voice acting is pretty awesome as well (well it's their occupation lmao). But anyway, check it out before assuming that it's shit. It's not a masterpiece, but still a pretty great, and innovative in the writing of the show.

P.S (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA-ijHB9LNc) This is the author himself, who give ""Son Wukong"" An anime live reactor a notice and a gift to him, and that would be all the Re:zero novel up to the current release, shirts, posters wtih everything autographed lmao.This was after a twitter DMs, and he even shares this ""Son Wukong"" live reaction of his anime to his twitter because he ""enjoys it"". Even the animation staff and watannabe director of Re:zero even watch it too lmao. Tappei Nagatsuki is the fucking man lmao"

Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is for me the most original anime that I've ever seen. 

The story tells about Natsuki Subaru who goes out from a supermarket and suddenly he appears in a different world (Isekai). In this world, there is no technology, nevertheless there is magic, knights, witches, and lots of creatures. Subaru will meet Emilia a silver-haired half-elf girl and he will fall in love with her. But in this world it's easy to die. And somehow, Subaru has the power of return to death or more precisely make the world travelling through time in the past
                  ...
before his death at a certain checkpoint. This power may be given by the Jealous Witch, the Witch who almost destroyed this world 400 years ago, this power will be very useful because Subaru will die over 15 times.

I have nothing in particular to say about art, except that was very well done.

The sound, was just INCREADIBLE, I really loved the openings and endings too, I can lisen to these openings evrey day without get bored, Redo and Paradisus-Paradoxum were very poignant and they were correspond to each part of this anime (I'm talking only about the sound).

Each character in Re:Zero were really well done and for each character we know who they is, deeply. Natsuki Subearu the main character is very very weak, he has absolutely no strenght inside him but he has a mental power unbelivable, he never abandons and always did his best, despite of his weakness. Emilia is the second main character, she is very beautiful nice and helpful but because of her appearence (she looks like the Jealous Witch) lot of people hate her, she is living in Roswaal's mansion. Roswaal we don't know a lot about him but he is a powerful wizard who controls the magic of six elements and he seems to be interested by Ram (not in love, I think). Ram and Rem are maids working in Roswaal's mansion, they are devils but as they are twins they only have one horn, Ram is a pink-haired girl who is sometimes mean with Subaru but she can be nice and funny sometimes, she manipulate wind magic. Ram is my favourite character, she is blue-haired and an she has a bigger chest than her sister, she is kind, caring and she is ready for anything while it's for Subaru because she is in love with Subaru. 

Every sunday were the most anticipated day, I prepared pop-corns, chocolates, drinks etc... for watching Re:Zero because each episode was very poignant and I enjoyed every episodes until the last one.

Overall, this anime was certainly the best anime I've ever seen, thanks to it's originality. I reeeeaaaaaaly recommand Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu (Re:Life in a different world from zero)."

The opening and closing songs are great, Konomi sings Redo, MYTH ROID sings Paradisus paradoxum and Styx Helix, STRAIGHT BET ..... Very Good

So invested, that once I start, I can't put it down. I've gotten so excited that I've started to sweat, even in a cool room. I've cried tears of joy, and tears of sadness.

The story starts out right in the middle of the first chapter, with the ""beginning"" being explained through flashbacks. This approach lets us feel how overwhelmed and confused Subaru (The MC) is a lot of the time. 

The many characters encountered throughout the series invoke strong emotions in me. Their personalities are slowly
                  ...
expanded, with their feelings, and reasons for their actions revealed over time, making them very deep, developed characters, that I really grew to care for. From the protagonist, to the friends around him, even the Villian(s), there is depth to them; Many anime suffer from flat characters, who are little more than their stereotype. While many characters can be put into various roles often seen in anime, they are not limited to those roles. They fill them up, with their own sense of self, and really come alive. 

That said, this story is not for the faint of heart. Things get gruesome, and Subaru has to struggle with a great many, horrible things weighing down his heart. But he struggles on, and perseveres, with the emotional support of the characters around him. He's not strong, or fast, or particularity smart, but he is driven, and determined; I end up feeling for him, and rooting for him. Clenching my fists, wanting him to succeed, against all the odds that seem stacked against him.

After I finished this anime, I'm left with the downside of watching something so spectacular. I want more content of this calibre, and it will be a long time before I can find something that is so satisfying to watch, as this was.

For me, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, "" Starting Life in Another World From Zero"", is one of my all time favorites, a list I can count on one hand."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"*The Following Review is something that I messaged to a friend of mine and it turned out to be something like a Review , I did not plan to make a Review but typing all of this for just one message just for one person seems like a waste so here are my thoughts*

1.Realism

I know you must be thinking right now , What? really are you kidding me?? Yea but Remember Re Zero is based on a 'what if?' Scenario .. So aside from that if you look closely , The Interactions of characters , The way they act gives realism to the story ..
                  ...
The way subaru acts greedy , scared , Bluffs , Tries to act overly cool is something anyone would do in front of someone they just meet to keep a good impression (Espeicially Emilia) ..

2.Dialogue

One of the best things about Re Zero , Since its adapted from a Light Novel .. It has a key feature called Dialogue.. Ep 18 and Ep 25 had one of the most well written and Legendary Dialogues which should go down in History but unfortunately anime is not as mainstream like Shakespheres books right? Aside from those two episodes also were good Dialogues

3.Contrast in Animation

The anime is usually bright and colorful but during the dark moments the colours dull down and blends perfectly with that environment , Whats more is that the sound compliments it and makes it great work..

4.ALL THE OPENINGS ,ENDINGS , And INSERT SONGS!!!

Seriously man its the only anime in which I actually liked all the songs and downloaded them with lyrics .. Upon Studying the lyrics both in japanese and English (Most songs were half in japanese and half in english mostly done by Myth and Roid (A new music group that made debut last year and became my favorites) I realized that it says about the themes , the thoughts , the concept etc..

5.The Concept 

 The concept is made of typical game type mechanisms .. Yes it is a fantasy based anime but It is purely game mechanics .. Subaru dies and come back to life - Checkpoints
Reinhardt has buffs like - Arrows can never hit him , Never get ill And atleast 20 more .. -Abilities gained through leveling up
And sorry the rest are spoilers from the Novel so I wont say them..
I am a Gamer .. This is the best setting ever for me..

6. Conclusion

 Re Zero is a Novel adaptation which is going to have 60 volumes and we are at Volume 10 .. Instead of giving us an empty meaningless ending they gave us some sort of conclusion and then told us to go buy the Novel .. It was actually pretty merciful of them because many anime end incomplete  , never even getting a 2nd season even with good amount of sales..

7. My favourite genres

Psychological , Action , Isekai Fantasy , Masterful Dialogues , I cant ask for anymore.. Thats why it went in my Top 3 ...

The things I Disliked :

I disliked nothing except the fact that they ended the show and there is no news of a 2nd season..  This Anime was only 15 percent of total Re Zero Material.. For a show which hasnt even reached its climax , I have no other words or reasons for disliking it.."

Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu presents a cliche type of story where someone suddenly gets transported to another world that differs from theirs by having magic. Don't let that just automatically tell you to not watch it. The main protagonist is named Subaru Natsuki who seems to another one of those Hikikomori tracksuit wearing characters at first. But he isn't gonna like have to kill a Demon King to
                  ...
save that world or something like that. He gets saved by a half-human, half-elf girl who whom he starts to develop feelings for, which grows stronger throughout the series. After getting killed a couple times & redoing a some stuff over, he realizes he has a power inside of him that can allow him to revive to a certain checkpoint if he ever dies. From then on, he starts going into problems that result in him dying and reviving until he finds a solution to it. During these revivals(or ""respawns""), he experiences tragedies of people he befriended/encountered over and over again in this world. His checkpoint would be overwrited at times when he successfully bypasses a level(the conflict he is facing gets resolved). During these respawns , we see somewhat development in his character through his time in this fantasy world(Note: we know nothing of his life before this world), we meet more characters and get to know most of them better as the story progresses maybe seeing background stories for some as a treat too. I loved most of the actions that Subaru did most of the time, and how conflicts were resolved by him. Overall I loved every character in this and shipped Subaru & Rem this whole series despite the ending being not what I hoped for, I still enjoyed this series and hope other otakus will enjoy this series as much as I did."

What makes a show great? Good story,characters,art along with good pacing.Re:zero succeeds to check all of them on the list.So,what makes it special? Unlike most other animes the main character isn’t perfect.No special powers,strength or intelligence.But how to make up for it?

With experience…..

Story-9/10
The story is set in a fantasy world where the main character is summoned for an unknown reason.While he tries to cope with the new world he faces death at every corner.But like in video games he finds himself being respawned at a checkpoint everytime
                  ...
he dies. When Giving up is not an option,Natsuki Subaru embarks on a ever repeating journey to make things right!

The story is well written and well paced.Lots of twists and turns.

Characters-10/10
Re:zero is full of great characters.You’ll atleast find one or two new waifus from this series.But the most noticeable character is the MC.At first,I found him to be quite funny and humorous.At mid-point I started hating him for some reason.But near the end ended up supporting and cheering for him.

Art-10/10
The art is absolutely beautiful! Nothing more to say.

Sound/Music-9/10
The music and sound effects go really well with the series.Not to mention the outstanding openings and endings.

Enjoyment-10/10
That was one hell of a ride.I remember waiting for a new episode every week with great anticipation.Every moment of it was exciting and thrilling.Probably one of the best animes of the season.

Overall-9/10
If you liked Stein;Gate or Erased this anime is for you! With hopes of a 2nd season I hereby conclude my review.

Thanks for reading :)"

He improves himself a lot towards the end. The plot and story line was great. Each character had a past and it touched on all of them. The mc's inner conflicts were great and it really mad you think. It went very deep and leaves you wanting more. It was overall just great the only flaw I would say is that they kinda forced the whole ""my hero"" idea because if you think of it Emlia is stronger than Subaru
                  ...
but that was fine with me. But what I loved the most was the artwork, it was outstanding and I loved it!!! (Except I wish he would change and stop wearing that track suit .3.) The only reason why someone might hate it is because of how forceful and stubborn the mc is but that is what he is supposed to be."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Recommended,"DONT LISTEN TO THE NAYSAYERS 
Ok to start off ReZero is one of the best anime I have ever seen; I will be the first to admit that there were moments when I cringed in the anime. Namely around the 15-16 episode mark. Dont listen to any reviewers that have NOT completed the anime. This anime is a roller coaster so you cant judge it on the individual parts, but the story overall. Ok now that my rant is over lets move on. 

Story: 
ReZero's story may sound like the typical otaku Neet character being tossed into a fantasy world full of sexy elves and
                  ...
scary looking demons; but be warned this is certainly not the case. This anime is not light hearted and full of comedy, although thankfully some parts include both of the former. It reminded me of the darkness in psycho-pass if thats any inclination to you how dark the story is. It starts out with the MC dying a few times in unbeliveablely  dark and epic ways, and the MC is forced to learn from his past mistakes to get to the right outcome; however most of this time like most lovable main characters he disregards this entirely. The story includes many great side characters and character development which I will explain later on. Overall the plot revolves around the witch satela that just happens to be the MC's main love intrests supposed doppleganger. This earns her alot of resentment even though the witch has not been seen in centurys; so you can probably guess she must have been quite the bad ass villan: anyway Im trying not to spoil the story for you so moving on. 

Art: 
The Art of this anime is absolutly amazing, especially the buildings, landscape, and characters. The studio who animated this was whitefox the animaters of steins gate, so think that level of animation in a fantasy realm. Really all you need to do is watch one episode and you will figure it out for yourself. The fights are amazingly choriographed -sorry for misspelling (it happens), and overall the animation is verry fluid. The only reason I gave art a 9 instead of a 10 was because I think the magic could have been a little better; but thats my most watched type of anime so Im a bit of a harsh critic in that area. 

Sound: 
i judge sound in anime at a pretty high standard think seraph of the end if you have seen it(if you havent WATCH IT). The opening and ending songs -4 total are all amazing and the soundtrack is magnificiant, in dark moments and at the end of an episode clifhanger it will send a chill down your spine. 

Characters:
Now alot of people hate on the MC in this anime and thats mostly because he isnt some OP god level mythical unicorn type motherf#$@@#. And in two episodes he has some real cringe worthy moments. However never in any anime have I seen a character developed as well as this one. He begins the story a dumb otaku who doesnt even understand his own world let alone the new one he's been dropped in
But after many deaths he learns from his mistakes and grows from them (sometimes in a negative way) The emotions he feels and the actions he takes are the same a real living person would. And overall I think he is probably the most relatable character an anime could make. The side characters are all amazing and have little things you learn about them, not so much backstory in the not so close to the mc characters but more about their personality and why they make the decisions they do. The characters close to the MC are given great backstories and you can really feel for them. Overall an amazing job by the writer. 

Enjoyment/overall
This is probably my favorite anime of all time, and thats coming from someone who has seen over 150 days worth of anime ( no i dont have the time to add them all to my list) Everything about it is well done, and it is definantly unique. 

So finally my advice to you, this anime should be in the top 5 on myanimelist, and the only reason it is not is the people who rate and review it before finishing it. 
So judge for yourself how good it is and WATCH IT!!!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"You know, for all the shit I give visual novels, I'll say this about them: at least they have the decency to fucking end when it comes time for them to expire. Light novels, on the other hand, never seem to be written with an end goal in mind. Every single one I've seen tries to be the otaku pandering version of a Shonen Jump manga (well, more otaku pandering than Shonen Jump already is) and as I've made it very clear before, I'm not into on-going stories, especially when they have the straightforward nature of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. I grew
                  ...
up on movies and novels my school made me read, so I'm used to things having a beginning, middle, and end, especially when said end give birth to a bunch of shitty sequels that make you want to castrate the entirety of Hollywood's population. And it'd be one thing if they had the substance of a (really good) live-action drama, but I've yet to see Hannibal: The Light Novel version come from Japan, let alone be as successful as that show.

Sitting through Holo and Lawrence flirting with each other whilst mostly ignoring the reason why they started traveling together to begin with might be your idea of a good time, but there's only so long a bunch of Tales skits are going to entertain me when you rely on them for substance. Oh, but these interactions are what allows us to care about the characters so that when the drama hits...in which case I stop you right there and tell you that philosophy can fuck right off. Yes you need to develop the characters, but you're not supposed to put the story on halt in order to do that. If you can't meld the character interactions with the plot, then you might as well have not had them at all. But then again, I didn't grow up on superhero comics or anything otaku-related like a lot of anime fans (especially these days), so maybe it's just a style of storytelling that's not meant for me. Just like idol shows. Or anime about bread.

The thing is though, even by those incredibly bizarre Marvel-esque standards, Re:Zero still isn't very good. And it's not just because I hate meta-humor, although that's certainly a big part of it. Despite what Digibro might tell you, anime has always been lazy in regards to being meta, but it's definitely gotten a lot worse in the last few years, and I'm getting really annoyed by how inward anime is starting to become as a medium in general with popular light novel shows like Saekano and even anime video games like Danganronpa. The main character is an otaku - which in theory is supposed to make him relatable to everyone but in practice would only make him relatable to anime nerds (which I am not) - and every time he brings up how something is just like one of those anime he watches, I wanted to reach into the screen and beat him to death with his own face for not realizing that for comedy relief to work, you need to have comedy and something to relieve.

And he keeps quoting anime tropes even when he's in danger. Hell, even the other characters occasionally join him on his nerdy rants despite video games and harpoon guns not existing in the world. It'd be one thing if Re:Zero was a comedy anime, but nothing about the premise is inherently comedic. No one wants to be the Pirate King in a world where pirates have superpowers. Nothing about the fantasy setting screams Tex Avery and none of the characters make Hanna Barbara sound-effects whenever they breathe. Very few of the jokes are even fantasy-related, so why the hell do I have to sit through a speech regarding the glory of the maid? I don't give a shit about maids. Especially not when characters are in the midst of getting burnt alive by a raging inferno.

But even if you did become infected with the same sort of fatal disease that all Romeo Tanaka fans have, the story is like every other light novel story ever in that it's ""light"" (which in my mind translates to ""incredibly boring""), and has all the storytelling quality of Dragon Age II - another shitty fantasy product. It's about this otaku dude with no past and no reason to be the lead that's not circumstantial named Subaru, as he one days get transported to a strange fantasy world for some witch-related reason that's never really elaborated on and falls in love with a half-elf princess named Emilia because the plot says so. However, the two of them end up as bloody corpses thanks to a mysterious female assassin, only for Subaru to discover that he has the ability to go back in time, Majora's Mask-style every time he dies. But this is just the setup. Where did this power come from? What overarching plot comes from it? Who's the main villain? Where's the grand adventure that usually accompanies these fantasy worlds? What exactly is Re:Zero about?

Well unfortunately, there isn't a single thing Re:Zero is ""about"" that appeals to anyone who's not an anime nerd or a Fire Emblem fan that disagrees with me that the franchise has turned bloody awful since the console releases. Every single character seems to be written with the mindset of ""ship first, characterize second"", and they all seem to change personality depending on what the plot wants to do with Subaru. Want to torture the dude? Let's have everyone hate him. Done with the torture? Okay, let's have everyone be nice to him now for no good reason. The only meaningful interactions Subaru has in the show are with the two love-interests: Emilia and a blue-haired maid named Rem, who people seemed to like an awful lot once she lost all her personality after becoming attracted to our rough otaku lead. Apparently, this is because the less your know about a person, the easier it is to ship them. A rule that I seem to recall being completely untrue during my brief shipping phase, but what do I know about what's cool these days?

And the plot and dialogue have about as much momentum as a Pro Stock car super-glued to a garbage crusher. It starts with Subaru getting introduced to his time travel powers, the characters, and an evil female villain we never see again in a plotline that screams ""obvious setup"" in capital lines and enough exclamation marks to fill the Atlantic Ocean. Three, technically four, episodes later and I still don't understand where the show is going with all this. So Subaru is going to move in with Emilia? Why should I care? Where's the story going to go from there? Well the next arc answers this question through a plot line of a mysterious killer in Emilia's mansion that might have acted as a tense mystery if the slice-of-life scenes weren't so utterly canned and the acting wasn't so hammy. But even if they weren't, the end boss turns out to be nothing more than a pack of dogs you could have defeated by chucking a fucking bone at them, and all it amounts to at the end is Subaru getting closer to Rem while having some lap pillow time with Emilia when he can be assed. We're halfway through the series and it's been nothing but prologue material that'd make the seventh Harry Potter movie blush.

But eventually, after sitting through twelve episodes of boring character interactions that were only that long because of the show's utterly stupid usage of its time travel gimmicks, the anime pulls a Shyamalan and gets into what it's really about. A self-loathing prideful dude whose shittiness destroys everything and everyone around him as a sort of deconstruction of the traditional shonen protagonist/trapped in a foreign world/anime in general storytelling. Basically Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc, except with a strange obsession for physically torturing Subaru repeatedly in order to fulfill the two-cour order to the point that it gets ridiculous, whereas Danganronpa Despair generally made the brutal killings of its anime tropes nice and quick bar the most important death scene, which stood out because it happened to that character and said character stayed dead. Listen show, I'm pretty sure I got that Subaru's prideful nature is toxic to humanity after you killed his ass to the point that his body literally broke apart. You didn't need to repeat it five fucking times with the only difference between each time being the method you used to do so and dedicating one episode to each time. Twice would have been sufficient, because the first time might have just demotivated him a bit, but other than that, this is is an anime. Not the Japanese version of American politics.

What really annoyed me with this ""true plot"" though is that all the torture amounts to at the end of the day is just to give our male lead an incentive to be a better person, which is the fucking white noise of how to do character development, whereas any good writer would have made the general direction from there a lot more bittersweet, or if you're Hideaki Anno, fucking brutal. But because Re:Zero's usage of time travel can conveniently erase a character's death whenever it wants to and make people forget how much of an asshole our lead is (and when they don't, they really easily forgive him), it makes all the effort put into depicting a twisted arm pretty pointless unless you really seeing torture porn animated. Not helping at all is that the actual torture is kind of lame and unimaginative. Nothing but bone-crunching and bleeding eyeballs, which - compared to Danganronpa's ridiculously creative death traps - just looks like the majority of the show's action scenes aka really bad. There's some decent animation in the fights sometimes, but they're either one-sided, badly choreographed, or shot to the point that you don't actually see the blows land. I know a lot of people talk up the white whale stuff, but I don't think the whales actually attacked anyone short of breathing on them, and I'm pretty sure Wilhelm's moves were the only ones that actually made contact.

So the show really never amounts to nothing more than making the viewer feel ""emotions"", which is something the creative team seems to be very much aware of because all the budget seems to go into the ""hard-hitting stuff"", causing the animation during the clean-up phase of Re:Zero's tale with the actual fighting and resolutions to look like absolute ass. The final scene is nothing more than a cheesy love confession with the screen brightness turned up and looks nowhere near as good as any of the climaxes in Episodes 13-18. And it didn't help that when all is said and done, all that happened was that Subaru went through ""character development"" to become a better man. But why? What was the point in watching that? Character development for the sake of character development can't function on its own as substance, and certainly not when the end goal of it is to be a better man for a girl who didn't even have that much screen time and whose half-elf heritage doesn't even factor all that much into the plot other than to be a convenient conflict. You do realize that I could just buy Tales of Symphonia at my local retail store, right?

I liked Danganronpa 3 because it used being ""anime"" ironically as well as a weapon to corrupt its well-meaning protagonists and their individual philosophies into a bunch of murderers where the only way to cheat death was if the writer was in a trolling mood, and Re:Zero's ""anime"" nature just feels incredibly lackluster by comparison. The only reason Subaru goes through any sort of shit is so that he can overcome the whiny drama and be rewarded with a personality-less girl who has no chemistry with him ala a shitty JRPG. And the only way he overcomes something is due to someone saving him at the last minute or becoming a little braver after suffering a traumatic event, which is also the kind of thing that characterizes most shitty JRPGs. When characters got corrupted in Danganronpa 3, they had to deal with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life, generally by staying corrupted or put into a computer simulation for the rest of their days. And most of all, love interests died as a result of their actions and stayed dead! Things stuck in those shows. And whatever interesting point Re:Zero brings up is always invalidated before too long, like a happy marriage after the honeymoon is over.

As a final point though, I don't know who voiced Subaru, but his voice is annoying as fuck. There were several episodes where it became too much for me to the point that I had to mute the video just to get through it, and this includes Episode 18 where I only got through the first two minutes with sound. Just because you're supposed to be a deconstruction of the alpha male doesn't mean you have to sound like a whiny bitch. And don't even get me started on the final villain. I'm pretty sure you could make a funky remix out of every annoying Kugimiya Rie character verbal tic she's ever done and it'd still be more listenable than watching Kirito orgasm at the sound of his voice."

I actually watched the whole show but only as a method of self-mortification. Whereas monks used to practice mortification of the flesh, I treated watching Re:Zero as mortification of my mind, patience and my sense of self-respect.

I hate it when everyone is super hyped about a show and I can't for the life of me understand why. And this is exactly what happened with Re:Zero. Everyone was excited about it and called it the best anime or compared it to objectively superior shows. I watched 12 episodes of the show and got bored of it. I also had to
                  ...
pause every time the MC said anything because I couldn’t stop cringing. But people kept saying ""dude, watch episode 15, you'll love it!"". Well, I watched it. And I didn't love it. But why exactly is the show bad? Let me explain.

Story:
The MC, who is a NEET/shut-in (it's just an informed flaw, he never shows any signs of NEET-ness that can't be attributed to his severe mental retardedness, more about that later) and who gets transported to a fantasy world for some inexplicable reason. Hopefully this will be at least a minor plot point in the future because during the first season it is completely irrelevant. WHY does it always have to be a NEET teleported to a fantasy world? If you need a person unaware of local customs etc. you could think of a multitude of different ways to introduce them in the story without resorting to that awful cliché. And the worst part is that he instantly figured out this cliché but the time-resetting one took him so long that for some time I thought that that time reset damaged his brain (later on I found out that actually he'd been brain damaged the whole time). Thankfully, he had that fucking bag of chips or he would still wander around the alleyways getting killed over and over 25 episodes later.

Anyway, the first 3(4) episodes were not that terrible. Actually, they were the best part of the show. I’d give that arc 6/10 even though I couldn’t see shit half the time because it was so dark (maybe that’s why I didn’t dislike it that much?).

The second arc is definitely worse than the first one. The MC becomes totally unrelatable and we get introduced to more boring, soulless, mindless characters that serve no other purpose than to orbit MC’s dick. The plot becomes a complete joke with overused random “humor” and embarrassingly bad dialogue. Even though I’m a very empathic person, I couldn’t relate to the main character at all, the “tear-jerker” scene (in ep. 8? I think) just made me look at my watch every few minutes which is never a good sign when watching anything. I don’t want to get too much into detail (and there isn’t even that much to go into) but it is safe to say that you could either compress episodes 4-11 into two episodes or, even better, get rid of them completely and the show wouldn’t lose anything important. My score for this arc is 2/10.

Episodes 12-14 is where the show went completely downhill. The amount of cringe was so huge that my body killed off half of my brain cells as a self-defense mechanism.

And what about the famous episode 15? Well, it was ok. Better that the previous 10 or so episodes but still mediocre at best. By this time, I totally hated MC’s guts and actually caught myself rooting for his opponents so I didn’t feel anything when bad things kept happening to him.

If the series just went downhill in episodes 12-14, it crashed to the ground and and made a 10 foot hole during episodes 16-21. Despite that, the show did something actually praiseworthy. Making two action-focused episodes so horribly, mind-bogglingly BORING is a huge feat that deserves recognition. Bonus points for including flashbacks filled with weird emasculation fetish-fuel (what is up with that? The whole show is full of it). In fact, these episodes were so boring and dull that I had to watch the rest of the series at triple speed to somehow ease the pain connected with watching it. I may hate myself but not to such an extent as to watch this show normally. I actually tried to play it even faster but unfortunately I couldn't keep up with the subtitles.

Still, I have to say that this last arc was more interesting than the 2 or 3 previous ones. Of course it doesn't say much since nothing more boring than those arcs even comes to my mind. I know that I watched the show for free and of my own free will but somehow I still considered filing a formal complaint about my wasted time. Watching the show was like watching a trainwreck but even less fun. The only thing that was interesting about the show was wondering how much worse the next episode was going to be and the show never disappointed and always brought a large dose of cringe, stupidity and boredom.

Generally, the time-reset cliché is not used very well and the show suffers from edgeitis. It also paradoxically depends on using shock value and resetting time instantly after, which makes most of it pointless. And please, don’t tell me that this makes the MC slowly go insane or whatever. He’s already retarded. He doesn’t need to go insane as well.

What is more, this series can't decide what type of show it wants to be. It tries to be a psychological show but it utterly fails at it because the characters are retarded and/or one-dimensional. It includes a lot of action but its action scenes are so boring that most harem anime have better action sequences. It tries to be a drama but the only sad and heartbreaking part of the show is the number of people enjoying it.

Taking everything into consideration, the story definitely showed promise but it was presented so poorly that it is impossible for it to salvage the show. It’s all because of the aspect of the show that definitely is the weakest, namely…

The Characters:
Oh boy. I don’t think I’ve ever watched a show with worse characters. The ones that aren’t stupid or boring are stupid, boring and annoying at the same time.

The MC is probably the worst MC I’ve ever seen. It is definitely nice that the author tried to give mentally retarded people some representation in the show but perhaps he shouldn’t have included one as a main character. The MC is completely unrelatable and during the course of the 15 episodes he becomes completely unlikable as well. Again, it is fine to have characters that people are going to despise in the show but please, don’t make them the MC!
The MC is incredibly dumb, can’t do anything right, is a creepy stalker that acts like an obsessive ex-boyfriend and is the cringiest character that I’ve ever seen. Every time he opens his retarded mouth he spews things that instantly increase your autism spectrum. Seriously, I didn’t cringe that much even when watching WataMote and that show was based on second-hand embarrassment humor.
What is more, the MC doesn’t learn anything, like, for example, the fact that he can kill himself to fix the past. He did it once and he fixed everything thanks to that but he never tries it again. However, during the course of the series, me saying ""kill yourself"" to the main character gradually stopped meaning ""go back in time and fix everything"" and changed the meaning to ""just end the suffering - both yours and mine"". Apart from mental retardation, the MC also suffers from a bipolar syndrome. Every time he dies he switches from being a pathetic waste of oxygen wallowing in self-pity to being a super-aggressive and even more supper-annoying avatar of cringe and stupidity, and vice versa. He gets less dumb towards the end of the series but his cringe-factor is still through the roof and you still can't take such an embarrasing person seriously.

Also, the fact that he can’t tell anyone about his time-resetting predicament is a very cheap plot device. If I recall correctly, it had a practical use once or twice but that still doesn’t justify that.

So, to sum it up, the MC is retarded, unlikable and unrelatable and his motives are stupid (he went through so much shit just to save maidos whom he had known for a whopping 5 days or so and who showed almost nothing but disdain for him and one of them actually tried to kill him).

I’ve always thought that there is nothing worse than a bland, beta character without any personality traits but they at least usually have an interesting supporting cast unlike the MC in this show.

I’d discuss other mouth-breathing, soulless and completely bland and cookie-cutter characters but it is actually not worth it (just like this show). There wasn't a single character that I liked when the show ended. I liked the crazy dude for an episode or two but I got bored of him pretty quickly. And I felt pity for the blue haired maid because she was trapped in this show and fell for such an idiotic character. It doesn't mean that I liked her though. Besides being a cheap waifu-bait, she is completely uninteresting and unremarkable.

Seriously though, I don’t remember any show that had characters so terrible. Even other edgy shows like Akame ga Kill had a few characters that I almost liked.

Art & Sound:
The art is ok. A solid 7/10. There is no fanservice which is nice. Character designs are shit though.
There is nothing particularly good about the audio aspect of the show but there is nothing bad either. Unremarkable.

Summary:

Let’s see: the premise was ok but the actual story is bad (to put it mildly), characters are atrocious and drag the whole show down, the rest is unremarkable. However, I actually have an idea how to salvage this show in the second season (if there is one). Let the MC reset time back to the first episode, kill him for good and start again from there.

You probably noticed that I used the words ""retarded"" and ""unremarkable"" a lot. That's, of course, because most of the show is retarded and the rest is unremarkable. The fact that most discussions about the show are waifu wars also confirm it. When someone says that the show is great just keep in mind that what they probably mean is ""I liked one of the maids/the loli/that half-elf"". Even if the best part of the show is waifus, then it completely fails since they're so bland and uninteresting. Seriously, no matter what you're looking for in a show, other shows do it better. If you want to see a good time-travel-related anime then watch Steins;Gate. If you want to watch a good transported-to-a-fantasy-world anime… Well, tough luck. But other anime are still probably better than this one. However, if you are tired of actually good anime and have too much time to spare and/or you are a masochist... then I still can't recommend this show. It would be too cruel. Recommending this show should actually be considered a criminal offense. 

Right now, the show is rated 8.77 on MAL which is a complete disgrace. Originally, I rated this show 4. I did so because it was horrible but I still watched it. Unfortunately, it commited the worst sin any show can commit - it became really boring. I mean, it had horribly boring episodes before but episodes 18-21 were so dull that it actually made me think that I'd rather go outside than watch this show and that had never happened to me before when watching anything else. That's why I deducted one point. And, once again, I’m surprised by the fact that so many people genuinely enjoy this show.

I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but it’s still a stupid opinion."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Mixed Feelings,"2016 was the year where we got some amazing new shows like Grimagar and Fantasy, KonoSuba, Tanaka Kun and Flying Witch and in that same year we had too, deal with disappointing too, downright awful shows like Erased, Joker Game, Divine Gate and freaking Big Order which are one the worst things I have ever seen in my life. In spring 2016 we are presented with a fantasy anime with a time travel twist. That anime is Re:Zero.
Out of all the anime that was hyped to, death Re:Zero was the most hyped and talked about anime of 2016.
The question is does it deserve all the
                  ...
hype? Let's find out


Story. 
The story beings with our main lead Subaru who is just living a normal at earth then suddenly he is transported into a fantasy world.
From they're Subaru just helps people solve the problems before they start while trying to, survive at the same because if he dies not only he's are immediately brought back too, life but everything that he has done will be rested. Very occasionally there will save points meaning when Subaru gets too, the that certain save point he will die and respawn too, the save point instead you know going back too, the beginning.
Am just going to, be honest with you right now.
The story is not that good as it doesn't really seem to go anywhere. Some people may say that it makes the story unpredictable but the problem is Re:Zero is not anime original series.
Also like too, mention the many plot holes that Re:Zero has like how did Subaru get his powers, when did this start, why do some of the characters appear in one minute and all of the sudden they are gone and never seen again throughout the, are they any other consequences when Subaru dies, who is Emilia, What did Subaru do in his past life back on earth and the list goes on and on. It doesn't really make any sense because of Re:Zero like too, throw in new characters that barely do anything in the story.
World Building of Re.Zero is okay at best because while the show explores the Kingdom of Lugnica well the other races like the witches, monsters as well of the labing nations, timelines, and the world history are never explained at all. But hey least its better than Akame Ga Kill world building which is nonexistent at all.
Also, I feel that after episode 18 the show literally becomes rushed in terms of pacing.
Update!!!
I have read the visual novel and arc 3 in the novel didn't have this problem but the anime tries too fit almost the entire arc in such small episode number.
Overall I have mixed feeling towards the story in Re:Zero
5.5/10
Characters.

Not going to, lie beside from Rem I found this cast to be either decent too missed potential. They are really not bad characters but I wish they did more with them
Subaru is just an average main protagonist who gets transported into a fantasy world.
Now what I have been told people that he's realistic. He started off kinda realistic but as the series he literally became unrealistic.
Most of the time he's either a whiny bitch or being edgy because of plot sakes.
He also tries too, be a comedic character but he fails because it was just painful too, watch and it's downright cringe-worthy.
Also, Subaru can be really emotionally manipulative at times to a point it becomes very annoying.
If they're any positives with Subaru at all that would be the character development. Yes, he actually a decently developed character because I like how he always project characters like Rem and Emilia from danger.
Overall Subaru is a mediocre character at best and subpar at worst.

Now we have are Rem
Now she is the character that I really liked from start too, finish.
I liked how she always supported Subaru even when she sacrifices herself for Subaru. Also, her back-story is well told and it explains why Rem became the person that she is.
She the only character in this series that has real character development because Subaru character development for the most part just exists too, move the plot.
Overall Rem is one hell of an amazing character and easily the best thing about Re:Zero.

Lastly, we have Emilia.
She is the most wasted potential character in this show for me.
She started off strong with a very likable person but as the series progresses she was out was completely out picture due to lack of screen time.

The rest of the characters were decent I guess.
I really enjoyed characters like Felt, Reinhard and Felix for been interesting and enjoyable characters.
Also, the villains were not that good at all.
Overall this character cast could have been better.
6/10

Art/Animation.
If you guys can’t tell the art of Re:Zero is great and very appealing too, the eye with a nice and smooth color usage from the backgrounds/scenery too, the color of the character designs.
Also the character designs were also great and they fit with the setting of Re: Zero
Studio White Fox really has outdone themselves with the animation because it's very smooth and constant in both the action and drama scenes.
Overall I like the art and animation here.
8/10

Sound.
The OST for Re:Zero is good but I wasn't a fan of any of the tracks.

The first opening was just wonderful too, listen easily the second best thing about Re:Zero.
The second opening is just mediocre too, be honest.
The first ending is wonderful too, listen and in general very relaxing. This ending theme is iPod worthy.
Same goes for the second ending theme of the series

As this time of the review, there's no official dub for this show.
8/10

Final Thoughts.
Re:Zero is a fun but flawed show.
While I kinda liked in the beginning but as the series progresses the show literally falls apart big time.
While the setting was nice, the openings/endings and Rem were good. The story was mediocre and too short for its own good, decent worldbuilding, characters range from good to miss potential, great visuals and a nice ost and great voice acting.

In short, this show is decent at best and wasted potential at worse.

Final Score 5/10"

Hopefully, this isn't much of a problem. With that out of the way, let the ranting commence!*

The more I think about Re:Zero, the more infuriating it becomes. 2016’s third monumental mainstream title is a sham! It shot for the stars, gave up halfway, and settled for firey Venus. It had a lofty goal of delivering a message to the audience about their habits, but amidst the laughable, self-indulgent torture of its main character and neat-looking “directing tricks”, it was too scared to commit. It’s
                  ...
The Last Jedi of anime, except even worse. Both start off harmless enough but by the end divulge into a mess, except I resent this show more for its sheer dishonesty as opposed to just not having a backbone.

So, what did Re:Zero attempt to tell us? To find out, you’d need to understand the main protagonist. Wanna know why you hated him? It’s because he was meant to represent you, the entitled audience who escapes life by inserting yourself into fantasy. You who feels entitled to a 2D anime girl of your choice because you think you understand life and the scenarios of any given genre of fiction. He is an attack, a satire on the self-insert, as well as a twisted reflection of the audience, at least for 3/4 of the show. You see, after the infamous confession scene in episode 18, he stops being antagonized or treated as someone who just doesn’t get things. Now he suddenly is smarter and less desperate than he’s ever been; now he’s going to get the girl and help defeat the enemies who caused him immense pain earlier. Now he’s easier for you to insert yourselves into, and now he is suddenly cool with many of the people who felt disgusted or annoyed by him. He lost the one thing going for him, the one thing that made him better than the rest of the cast. He has now become the self-insert he was created to mock.

That’s not to say they did a remotely good job to begin with. For one, there are moments in which after the mildest of trial and error, he suddenly knows how to solve any given situation. Afterwards, everyone around him who hated or otherwise didn’t care much for him is suddenly cool, but on a smaller scale. Look no further than the end of the second arc, with the now iconic Rem turning from hating Subaru and wanting him dead, to loving him with the passion of a yandere, in the span of an episode, solely based on him helping her survive even when bleeding badly himself. I get that this is a noble action and that if you hated someone and he did that for you, you’d likely rethink your position on that person, but Rem becomes an entirely different character in the span of one scene! If this moment didn't reveal the show's true colors, then the third arc which comprises of the entire second half of this show, most certainly does.

They do still give Subaru the most painful wake-up call in recent years, but often through contrived means that are poorly resolved. The payoff of Subaru realizing his mistakes, adapting, and improving never hits, as even with his blood sweat and tears, it's never truly earned. After the relentlessly awful gauntlet of middle episodes, after their insulting attempts at shaming Subaru through pathetic “aesops” and punishments characters inflict that are contradictory to their nature, as well as one of the most horseshit plot ideas I’ve seen with questionable existence-erasing gas, the show can’t handle it anymore! After all of the headache it put us through, it instead opts to play it as safe as all the Light Novels it went against! It's all part of this ridiculous cycle where it punishes and tortures Subaru and therefore audience by proxy, and then handsomely rewards them with more waifus and cool shit with the sole purpose of the pattern beginning once again for three arcs in a row. It's especially insufferable in this third arc given that this is where it pretends like this is the last straw for Subaru and employs all of these fake lessons, developments and trials before actively undercutting all of that once again. No wonder nothing feels earned! No wonder the aesops and lessons the show piledrives into Subaru's/our skull in this arc in particular are so offensively fake! No wonder I feel ripped off! This show is one of the most dishonest anime I've ever seen!

This isn’t even going into other reasons why the writing crumbles faster than Subaru’s mental state, from the pathetic names of some of the enemies, to time loops in which certain events that could not possibly play differently or happen at all somehow do (episode 3 has one with a little girl Subaru and his girl Emilia helped out previously), or how people know the smell of the underlying threat of this series --Satella, the jealous witch-- despite how they never saw her or smelt her. This isn’t even bringing up the laughable excuse of a finale, the hideous fight sequences and CGI, or how horrendously defined the checkpoint system truly is. The lack of remotely decent side characters and character designs wasn’t taken into account either, though to add, the cast is less interesting than even SAO's, and the villain is laughably horrid. The merits regarding the opening/ending themes and some of the visuals were left off the table as well. This is ultimately a cursory glance at the show's mishandling of its promised message and themes rather than a holistic look at the show's folly. As it stands, Re:Zero was only remotely respectable in its initial mediocrity, not when it abandoned all pretenses of sincerity.

Care to Re:Set for us, Re:ZERO?"

I got sucked into this anime b/c I made the mistake of trusting the hype train on this one. After watching it, I have no idea why this anime was so hyped. 

The story starts off with an interesting premise in the first couple episodes, and then quickly evolves into a shell of what its potential could have been. There are only 2 characters that undergo any type of real character development, and it is
                  ...
shallow at best. Not to mention this guy is thrusted into another world, keeps dying and going back, and b/c of this, it seems like he's known characters for months, but really it has only been a few weeks tops, and already he has formed deep bounds with many of the characters, including the love and admiration of some. I kept watching it hoping the plot would really get going somewhere, but it never did. You are left asking more questions by the end of the anime than when you started, and not in the good way. The whole world he seems to have been transported to is extremely shallow the whole way through the and hardly ANYTHING is ever explained.

Look, this story and world building and character building in this anime was honestly so terribly bad I could go on for a long time on it, but I'm sorry I'm just not one of those people that can write a college paper on an anime that frustrated me to this extent, especially when I'm pretty sure no one will ever read this. I'm not someone who normally rates anime's I have watched extremely low either. Typically b/c usually when an anime is just so bad I can't bear it I will give it up after around 3 episodes usually. The thing that was simply SO frustrating about this anime though, was that it had the formula. It had the setup to really turn into something special, instead, it never delivered. Imagine you wanted a nice car. You see a present in the driveway that looks like a car under the wrappings, and then you tear it open and its a little hotwheels car. The disappointment I feel in this anime can not be overstated.

Art-wise there are a few episodes and scenes that are well done, but as the anime goes on the quality VERY NOTICEABLY DROPS. Really after the first 3 episodes it becomes apparent, but there are some scenes where it gets good again, specifically some ending scenes.

Character Designs. There were honestly so many loli characters it was disgusting. Is this really what anime is becoming? Where the animators really think having 4/5th of the female cast being loli are a good thing? Apparently they are trying to appeal either 10-13 year olds or grown up perverts.

Please don't watch this. Or if you want to watch it, give it a chance, but if at any point you're thinking: ""just one more episode and I know something is going to happen that is going to make this anime really good all the sudden""...just stop it there. It never happens."

[Re:Zero – Our Very Own Buzzword]

What is deconstruction? What is subversion? What is the reason these terms exist within the realm of entertainment media? Why do they matter? Our need to attach holistically positive or negative terms to reinforce our own positive or negative ideals is a staple of criticism. It's a staple of judging media, period. These buzzwords have filled everyone’s vocabularies over the course of the last few years. Whether it's due to online critics or simply the consumption of analysis-based content without the interest and engagement necessary to understand these more nuanced topics. It's unfortunate that I even must call something like
                  ...
subversion or deconstruction a ""nuance"" at this point, since it most definitely isn't. However, with its use being flanderized beyond belief, I find it hard to call it anything but a nuanced definition filled with separate sub-contexts and colloquialisms. Which is disappointing because all these new meanings pull away from what these words were meant to describe within the realm of entertainment. 

Re:Zero isn’t what you may think it to be. I say this because after over a week of watching this show, I gaze over my ten pages of notes and I see things that I feel I wouldn’t care about if these newly defined adjectives weren’t tacked onto this show. Re:Zero feels like a victim of its expectations and what people drew it as, which is why I feel the need to describe exactly what I view is wrong with this series in excruciating detail. Detail that I feel will need to cut because I want this review to be at least somewhat palatable to the daily reader and not some thirty-five-thousand-word analysis that it may come out to be. 


Spoilers are to be expected here. If you are a someone who has yet to see the show and values complete plot cluelessness walking into it then I advise you not read any further. I feel the need to go step by step, arc by arc, and examine and identify the root of a show like this’ problem. It lays within marketing, within pandering, within safety, within the very industry which spawned its being. For once, I feel like I have a lot to say. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Re:Start – Beginning a Journey]

	The opening is boring enough. Our tracksuit wearing protagonist, Subaru, walks out of a convenience store, closes his eyes, and opens them in another world. The context to these events can be read into as the entire story of the show begins to slowly become clear, however, the “journey into the new world” aspect of this show didn’t have an inspired start. Regardless, it’s about what you’d expect from a “trapped in another world that just so happens to be the most generic possible fantasy setting that we’ve seen in hundreds of shitty Asian MMORPG’s”, especially since our protagonist is self-aware. Which doesn’t amount to anything, he points out things he recognizes from games and moves on. “This is like a video game”, isn’t really substantial or investing commentary in the situation. I get it’s supposed to be comedy, but it doesn’t sell the scene with these comparisons especially since he just got transported an alien world. You have no idea what will happen with your what just happened, yet; hey, at least it looks like a video game, right? 

He eventually encounters some thugs and meets his love interest. The wonderfully designed Emilia, who serves as the crux of this shows narrative in an expected way. From her very introduction, and my awareness that there most definitely won’t just be one girl in a show like this, I foresaw the obvious truth that she will be what drives the protagonist. Now it’s up to the show to “subvert” those expectations, which is a buzzword you better get ready to start hearing. Throughout the initial two-episode pilot, we encounter exactly what this show will revolve around. Subaru’s “Return by Death” ability, which was named by him because “hey, it’s like a video game anime thing!” This ability allows him to return to a previously visited situation and, for all intents and purposes, reset time. Okay, so it’s a Groundhog Day stuck-in-a-fantasy-world series with video game roots. You can see why I harbored doubt after the first two episodes, right? Unless it works hard to craft a separate identity that’s able to sustain a strong narrative then it’s bound to fail as a combination of two genres that are both really popular in the industry right now.

I’d go so far as to say that the entire idea is a perfect marketing strategy. If two generic archetypes for light novel shows are popular, why not mesh them? It’d be even better if the mesh comes from yet another light novel so you have previously established fans to add to the stock number you’ll get by just having appealing character designs and a quazi-harem. While the biggest surprise is its R-rated violence, which is still held back by the entire Japanese industry, unfortunately. On a slightly off-topic note, it’s so strange to see an industry that revels in the sexualization, even of incredibly young characters, yet recoils at the idea of having blood that doesn’t have a fake sheen and hilariously sloppy sound-effects. You may say these kinds of unbelievable sounds are a remnant of the past, however, I’ll offer my rebuttal in the words; “Evolve or go extinct.” 

The first few episodes may be generic; they aren’t overly bad. I remember first checking out the pilot with a few friends many months ago when it first aired. While I had no interest in picking it back up, I will say that they weren’t nearly as awful as any of us were expecting. This world, or its characters, aren’t interesting, but the premise and nature of the show isn’t an inherent turnoff either. 

We begin meeting a plethora of characters in the first mini-arc of the show that really go nowhere within the first season. Felt, a bandit-loli that is pretty much the shows tomboy. Reinhard which isn’t a heavy armor-clad German knight from the future, but instead is a generic spiky-haired knight wearing cool futuristic-yet-medieval robes that exposits some dialogue about magic or something.  They play virtually no role within the show’s first season apart from being reintroduced later, so ignoring them we proceed with the protagonist, Subaru, dying multiple times to what feels like poorly thought out situations. 

The first villain, which doesn’t get killed, also doesn’t return. I feel like this show is working extra hard to try and get as many elements moving without being sure of a second season. No hate against that, though. We proceed to the moment this show truly beings to show its colors. The introduction to the MC’s home for the next ten-ish episodes. A mansion that Emilia lives in with her cute spirit-cat, owned by Roswaal L. Mathers. There is another loli, Beatrice, who serves to give exposition and hilarious plot holes, then get promptly forgotten. As well as a group of maids. Rem and Ram. Now I say Rem, then Ram, because that’s pretty much how the show wants us to think.

These two incredibly well-designed and inherently attractive characters are twins that are, in my opinion, the finest example of waifu-bait I’ve seen in anime… so far. Especially Rem, since Ram, similar to most secondary’s, gets forgotten about quickly. Rem is an interesting beast, and as the story progresses I’ll get the opportunity to dive further into why I believe she’s so popular. 

	Now don’t get it twisted, I was very aware that these characters existed. The reason I watched the entirety of this show was because the ludicrous amount of hype that was being drawn to it. I want to say this directly, though, I’m not one to get fully invested into the hype. I was aware about the kind of show this was and I didn’t expect it to be anything great even if the community was collectively circle jerking about it.

The show then takes on a slice-of-life-esq narrative which involves Subaru getting to know everyone and then getting brutally murdered by a mysterious figure. These episodes are, by all means, light hearted. The scenes shift between teased romance and comedy often and the only true stingers we get are in the obligatory cliffhangers that exist solely to create interest in the upcoming episodes. I’m not one to care about cliffhangers unless they are used sparingly to create a drastic tonal shift. However, they quickly became extremely common-place within Re:Zero that they harbored no dramatic tension to them. You happen to glance over at the episodes run time and notice it’s about to end, “here comes the stinger,” you think to yourself. 

Towards the intended climax of this arc, as the baddie is revealed and I slowly start to get a better picture of this show, it began to infuriate me. Not since No Game No Life has a show gotten so deep under my skin as a product with the intended purpose of entertainment. It felt cloying in the worst possible way. The reveal that Rem was the assailant and that she was also a cute girl made me instantly understand that this show only has the intension of subverting expectations when it means not sacrificing its market value as something made to get money. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[Of Dogs, Rem, and Broken Things]

	This show isn’t bland, forgettable, or insipid. It’s infuriating, pandering, and redundant. Now I know what you may be thinking, “well, don’t those things go together?” No. Not really. There’s a distinct difference between praising something and simply having something be popular. I don’t get angry at Transformers for being an incredibly high-grossing film for the same reason I don’t get angry at Taylor Swift for selling millions of records every year. They’re there to fill that abundant market and they do it well. If I watch, or listen to them, I will review them accordingly. I gave Sword Art Online a two, and I gave its second season a one. I did this because I truly believe that show has nothing to offer to me as a viewer, however, I acknowledge its role in the entire industry. It’s the bran flakes, the transformers, the Swift, the Drake of anime. 

Re:Zero isn’t that. Or so you are lead to believe. Re:Zero tries to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be respectably different from the archetype it encapsulates, but it also wants to maintain the ability to sell to the people that love the archetype it encapsulates. I won’t be the first to say that this kind of entertainment inherently doesn’t work. The people who love SAO wouldn’t love something that completely contradicts why they love SAO, and to create a compelling, awe-inspiring narrative, you genuinely must do something completely contrary to what SAO did. I’m not saying this because SAO is a show that people love ragging on, because I can see why people would think that, I’m saying this because as a student of entertainment I feel it’s my job to discover what works, and what doesn’t. It’s also my job to understand why it works and doesn’t. 

Re:Zero doesn’t have this luxury so you are left with a show that is in an infinite tug-o’-war between itself. Two parts of a whole that can never be complete. This inherent want to reach for the stars but to stay grounded in preconceived tropes and ideals is what keeps this show thoroughly frustrating to watch, and what keeps me from ever getting invested in anything that happens. 

An easy example is the concept of subversion in context with this show. I see that word, as well as “deconstruction” being thrown around by people. Not only is there a complete misunderstanding of their intended concepts, but the entire idea is missed here. This is because subversion is used to comment on the archetypes being subverted in a clever way. It’s almost a backhanded and creative way to show, rather than describe. It is a play on expectations, but it isn’t a twist. A twist is something you don’t see coming, a subversion is the ability to twist what you may think describes something. What it isn’t is meta. A subversion doesn’t have to be meta. Re:Zero misses this mark with astounding accuracy. 

Subaru is a self-aware character, and that’s fine. But the only explained subversion I see here is his ability to point out a cliché. Which is, naturally, a fine thing to do from a character like this. Yet they don’t comment on this cliché, they don’t do anything with it, he simply comments on it and continues through with it. Once again, the show attempting to have its cake and eat it too. It doesn’t work and, as I’ve said, is frustrating as hell to sit through. 

Re:Zero’s meta nature is something that detracts from its verisimilitude, but the show needs to have believability if it wants to be taken seriously; which it does. The amount of cloying emotional melodrama that occurs within this shows second arc is intoxicating, as I constantly found myself with flashbacks of Your Lie in April, as every character’s teary-eyed confessions and pained yells try to claw at your heartstrings. I said this during my review of that show and I’ll say it again here, if you want me to care and feel bad about something, give me something to feel bad about. I want to know these characters before you tell me why I should be crying. I don’t care that something sad is happening. 

This is further exacerbated with Rem and Subaru’s growing relationship and how the situations they find themselves in are absolutely ridiculous. This witches curse that Subaru is inflicted with conveniently prevents him from telling anyone what he is going through, yet he obviously begins to get attached to these characters. However, to my hilarious surprise, they begin to reciprocate these feelings towards him without any reason to. 

At this point in the show it was very obvious that the writer was going for the villain-empathy into wanting companion trope with Rem. She’s “evil” for a little bit but I don’t think anyone with an eye for television believed that she wouldn’t turn good. I haven’t seen much anime at all and I can easily tell that when a character is cute, they must be inducted in the harem. Especially if this show is in a fantasy setting with a spiky-haired protagonist who only has one pair of clothes. Rem was clearly going to start wanting to floss her teeth with Subaru’s pubes, the question was… how? 

The “attack of the dogs” mini-story serves to finish a wider arc as well as to give reason for Rem to be inducted into the Subaru show. Yet it’s done in such a backhanded and hilarious illogical way that I had to literally pause and sit back in true-to-god shock at what I’m watching right now. To explain further, let me spell out the first, and incredibly hilarious plot-hole that’s so bafflingly in your face that I’m surprised people didn’t just outright drop the show. 

Earlier on in the Re:Zero’s second arc, Beatrice, or as Subaru calls her, Drill-loli, as she has funky looking hair-drills, explains to him that curses are inherently incurable. You cannot cure a curse with simple magic. The way a curse is placed on you is through touch, so the biggest way to avoid getting it placed on you is to avoid touching. Which is kind of dumb to begin with, since by those means this world may be the most unsafe and awful place to live in. But regardless, those are the rules. Fine. I can accept that.

However, literally two episodes later, while Subaru is investigating how he got cursed, he finds the culprit and takes the information to Beatrice. She shows him the location of the curse and then… I kid you not, cures it with simple magic. There was this special moment where I was waiting for the show to acknowledge what just happened. I waited and waited and then the credits rolled. Then I realized I was watching something that’s bad. Then it all made sense to me. 

	With this shows lack for attention explained and showcased, the “attack of the dogs” arc should’ve been more expected to me. At this point I was watching this show because I was curious to see what anyone liked it in. Subaru, and trust me, I’ll get to his character later, throws himself into a hilarious dangerous position where he is positive to get brutalized again, however, to his surprise, Rem the cute-totally-not-pandering character bursts out of the woods and saves him. She promptly makes work of the mabeasts and shows him that she’s one hell of a badass (but she’s totally cute and dressed like a maid so not threatening in terms of characterization). Then more dogs show up. Yet for some reason she says that now it has become too dangerous and it seems like this is a situation they may not survive. Even though she just obliterated fourteen demon puppers in a few seconds. She tells Subaru to run away and he kind of does, as she follows him whilst chopping, smashing, and bashing her way through the plenty of demon dogs being thrown at her.

The next we see of her she’s been wounded, somehow. Then a rockslide occurs. This rockslide has direct contact with Rem, yet for some reason it ends up knocking her into the sky. Which baffled me. Aren’t avalanches supposed to suck you under? So, she gets knocked into the sky and falls onto the ground bloodied and beaten. However, her true edginess has just begun, as it’s revealed that she is actually a one-horned demon. Cool! She begins to go super saiyan and just destroy all these dogs that stand between her and survival. Subaru, being the retard he is, notices a dog behind her and instead of gauging the situation as it is, this bitch is going HAM, he decides to push her out of the way and sacrifice himself. Which makes zero sense in context or without context. She was going ballistic and just destroying them. He begins to get chomped up as a distant call of his name is heard from her. 

This is further unexplained as to why she called his name because as we see later in the next arc that she has no concept of what she’s doing whilst in the demon form. So, her calling his name would be like the hulk reading a dictionary whilst hulking out. Makes no sense. Regardless, this kind of ridiculous and flawed kindergarten writing is prevalent throughout the entirety of this shows first half. This doesn’t just make me lose faith in what makes animation great, this makes me lose faith in what makes entertainment great. The fact that countless people praise this show to the extent they do while looking over obviously failed, major narrative problems makes me believe that the only reason people like this show is because for once the eventual love-interest is also someone who kicks ass on occasion. That’s not anything new, why do people care about this? Oh, yeah, she’s cute. There is one thing giving the viewer what they want. There’s another thing with force feeding them forced romantic bullshit with no character, chemistry, or creativity until they are bloated, greasy balls of bullshit rolling around praising a show for elements that aren’t there. 

At this point in the series I would’ve dropped it two times over. I honestly couldn’t stand it. At the time, it was the epitome of everything I despise in anime and why this medium isn’t taken seriously. It is pandering bullshit disguised as subversion when in reality it’s a show made to make you feel the basest of emotions while wrapped in a semi-original premise. There are non-characters flopping around on-screen until one them gets murdered in some boring, edgy, dark, and uncreative way. I don’t care these characters are getting killed because they have the personality and engagement-potential of a wet mop. 

The show’s third arc, which expands on Rem and Ram’s backstory, which to the shows credit isn’t fucked up with crappy plot holes and semi-cleverly explains Ram’s reliance on Rem as a parallel to Rem’s earlier reliance on Ram. The show even goes so far as to hint at a sadomasochistic side of Rem, as her younger self is shown smiling at her sister’s fate. However, much like a lot of this shows earlier elements, it is never mentioned again. The backstory itself isn’t overly creative, however, the way it is told is engaging. Unfortunately, the obvious conclusion from this backstory still needs to be explained by Rem in the most contrived and “do you get it yet?” monologue. 
Re:Zero also has a tendency to pull character abilities out of thin air. Ram gets some crazy psychic abilities that weren’t ever actually talked about before she had to use them, which, while acceptable, still is an incredibly unoriginal way to introduce and use character abilities. The fight scenes within these arcs are also resolved through convenience and not actual development. This shows over-reliance on a character’s appearance to make you care about them is a perfect example as to why a lot of anime struggles with character relations in my eyes. I don’t care if you are gorgeous or ugly, you need to be interesting if you want me to be engaged in your story. This is a cheap tactic to create empathy where otherwise there wouldn’t be any. 
The third arc wraps up with Rem having a breakdown over her previous childhood reliance on Ram, while Ram has a reliance on her now. She does the thing every anime character in these shounen shows does and blames herself for things that were very clearly out of her control in every way. Cause why not. Since Subaru is a white knight (more on that later), we get a scene where he talks about how amazing she is, yet the things he brings up are kind of hilariously mundane. He talks about how she’s a good cook. He tells a maid… how she’s good at cooking. Listen, she’s having an emotional breakdown here and if your main talking point is how good a woman is at cooking then I think you’re talking skills are exactly where your ideologies are; in the past. I’m not some ranting feminist or anything, but this was a hysterical scene for all the wrong reasons. 

It also became very clear that Subaru doesn’t have a vested interest in Rem. He has always liked Emilia and will most definitely end up with her by the end of this season. Yet this show really tries to make you believe that he won’t, even if it is obvious he will. This is further disappointing since Emilia, up to this point, lacked any kind of character. At all. While Rem was a mish-mash of the most appealing possible waifu traits, Emilia was a cute mom. Hey, she’s unaware about flirting and is soft-spoken. That’s her personality. Yet Subaru is head-over-heels for her for reasons that can only be described as “plot-oriented”, since the only thing she must offer is her well-done design. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[A Tale of the Whitest Knight]

	Subaru sucks. He is an infuriatingly incompetent main character. Not because he has character. It’s because he’s genuinely inexplicable as a character. He starts off as a snarky self-aware protagonist that isn’t original, but serviceable. Then he becomes flirtatious. Then he becomes edgy. Then he reverts to where he was but with more self-awareness. However, what truly drives me nuts is how much of a white knight he is. If you are unaware of this term, Urban Dictionary will aid me with the definition; “A person (usually a male) who sees the typical maiden in distress, and believe that he can help her.” 

Subaru is this. Except he’s like what you’d imagine a socially incapable neckbeard to be like around girls, but the girls are just cutout waifu characters. Yet Subaru acts incredibly confident, yet still defensive of these characters which can’t be described as anything but his own possessions. I could honestly see him forbidding one of them from going outside just because he fears for them. The only reason for his infatuation with them is because they are cute, and man if cute girls don’t make the anime world go around. 

So he feels indebted to Emilia for her ability to save him, yet he feels indebted to the point where he falls in love with her simply because she saved him. It’s such a shallow reason to love someone that I honestly didn’t expect the show not to acknowledge it. Yet it doesn’t. Subaru gets himself into so many obnoxious situations simply due to his ability not to let his possessions get hurt. It is maddening to see this kind of story repeat over the course of this shows first half. Actually, fuck Subaru.

[Politics in Anime]

Politics suck in anime. I haven’t seen a single anime do politics well. I don’t want you to take this as a holistic statement. I haven’t seen much anime, but much like anyone’s notions about television or anything, really, they are based on experience. In my experience, politics in anime are insanely unappealing. They are always so black-and-white that they lack any actual tension or reason to be invested in the situation. What makes politics interesting is how much moral grey there is to the arguments being made. However, that is never actually portrayed. So when Re:Zero delves into some politics in the middle half I was at my peak groan-level. It was hitting every preconceived trapping and archetype so well that I was expecting some kind of twist showing that all of this was an elaborate plan and it was all just some kind of simulation. 

But no. We are introduced to these wacky and zany archetypes of political figures during a big meeting where the new ruler of their land is decided. These elderly councilmen all line up to determine the leader, which all happen to be cute-ass girls! Then the bickering begins. For an entire episode, we get non-stop bickering from everyone. Every ruler states their desires and motivations in such a amusingly forced way that It was a surprise the show didn’t point out that cliché. They just step up on their little soap box and give us a line or two about what they want to do. Let me break it down for you. 

Potential Leader 1 -->  I want equality for all!

Potential Leader 2 -->  I hate everyone and I just want to rule over all you scum

Potential Leader 3 -->  I’m greedy and just want stuff

Potential leader 4  --> The government sucks and I want reform

So two of those four are completely drawn to be characters not there to truly create any kind of political and moral intrigue. They are just the “bad guys”. The fourth leader is there to play a part in a future episode, which she does. The first leader is Emilia and is obviously the one audiences should want to win. 

How is this compelling again? Why should I care about this? What’s the point of this arc? Oh, yeah, to have Subaru become the whitest knight of them all. There is clichéd bickering in front of the council of elders that are just kind of sitting there watching their leaders bicker over what might as well be spilled milk, which is lacking any self-awareness. Subaru hears his waifu get offended over her race, which is half-elf, and gets triggered and begins to try and yell at people. He then declares himself, get this, her knight. And the knights in this show all wear white. I couldn’t even make this up if I tried. Then he promptly gets beaten up by another knight and then explodes on Emilia for not repaying him in any way. Yet all he’s done is act like a white knight and get himself killed many times. It’s dumb, yet it creates a rift between the two that lasts the entire second half of the show. He likes her cause she’s cute and nice. Then tries to be her knight. That’s this arc. 

When I went to the fan-reaction of this episode so many people were praising the characterization Emilia got that it prompted me to want to re-watch this episode. Where was she being characterized? All it did was give her the ability to get upset. Fucking good. She should’ve been annoyed by how clingy and annoying Subaru is by the fifth episode. These fans are praising a character for literally just showing an emotion that isn’t her base kit of cute blushes and smiles. Is this how fucking backwards and asinine liking a show like this has become? “Well this character isn’t just waifu-bait cardboard-cutout-chan, what great writing!” This wreck is doing the bare minimum here. 

A few things happen here and there and he finds that everyone died. I don’t care because over the course of fourteen episodes they didn’t develop anyone but Rem, and her development went from deadpan cute maid with a bad ass side to cute maid that loves our protagonist because he saved her by getting almost killed for no reason with a bad ass side. All these characters were slaughtered yet we already know exactly what will happen. Something will lead to his death and then he’ll have another chance at it all. This is a fault in the very concept of the show. It’s showing us all this shocking shit yet none of it is retain-able because none of it is lasting. The only way to make it last is through Subaru’s emotional state. Yet that gets reverted quick, as I will explain shortly. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[Episode 15] 

The one thing I knew about this show other than that “Rem is best girl!” was that episode fifteen was a doozy. I was expecting some twists, I was expecting some turns, I was expecting something neat. Obviously, my expectations slowly waned as I watched the fourteen episodes leading up to it. All I was expecting at this point was that it won’t leave me wanting to gouge my eyes out. Here’s hoping for some hype!

You know what? It delivered on hype. It was the best episode of the show, bar none. While this isn’t necessarily a great accomplishment, it is something nice nevertheless. Unfortunately, I don’t think it was the best episode for the reason the show was intending it to be. It introduced a new villain and oh boy is he hilarious. Episode fifteen made me genuinely laugh harder than I had in a week. This new villain is like those generic anime villains where they’re eyes bulge out of their faces and they are all zany and wacky and edgy. Also, in true Re:Zero fashion, he’s hopelessly self-aware about certain clichés yet the show still does them so those self-aware remarks serve no purpose other than to rub in the fact that they are doing these clichés with no actual subversion. But he’s also like discount joker; and it’s fucking sidesplitting. What makes it even funnier is that the characters are genuinely frighted on him. I had tears in my eyes for all the wrong reasons as our beloved character, blue waifu, had all her bones broken and her limbs twisted. It was glorious. I was so happy to see this show showing something gruesome for once. 

I won’t lie, I’m a huge fan of gore. I think the ability to show something gory, whether it’s for shock value or not, is inherently interesting in some way or another. The idea of gore is, in concept, very interesting. I’ll avoid discussing why as it’ll make this insanely long review even longer, however, I will say that I think it has the potential to add a lot to something. This show was bloody, but it wasn’t gory. It was always just streaks of blood or just wonky gushes and sprays here and there. It never felt brutal and it sure as hell never felt emotionally powerful or draining to witness. Rem getting destroyed wasn’t overly disgusting or anything, but at least there was a small effort made here to be a little disturbing. I would’ve loved if they took it farther. Like, much farther. To sell a psychopath you need to not be restrained by the industry. 

I was shown how gory the show could’ve been in some illustrations that I believe were based on the Light Novel (if not directly from it) and I was thoroughly saddened by the fact that this was airing in an industry where even a little gore would be censored immediately. I feel like if it embraced its B-movie roots it would’ve been an astoundingly fun show to watch. Unfortunately, not, though, and as the hilarity ends and the regular cloying-ass cliché dialogue starts again we revert to what the show sucks at. Just about everything else. The episode, though, to its benefit had a great cliffhanger for once. 

This truly awe-inspiring cliffhanger was unfortunately undermined by an after-credits scene that sucked all the epic-ness out of everything.  The fifteenth episode finally had the show revel in fuckery and was quite enjoyable because of it. It’s a shame that it was the only one of its kind, since this show refuses to be campy even if it is. These characters are meant to be killed, and while I know a lot of people would be upset with since I’m sure everyone loves blue-hair waifu and everyone loves white-hair waifu and probably didn’t like red-haired waifu as much, but I, personally, would’ve loved to see a classic grind house in anime form. It’d be a pleasure to watch with friends. 

An increase in gore would’ve also had a better effect on the story. Since the only way to raise these psychological stakes is to have us experience what Subaru is. You do this by showing us the gruesome results in a way that does have us recoil in nastiness. The way Re:Zero does this is just weak. It felt like Subaru didn’t “want to die”, however, he had to, but it doesn’t feel like remotely enough progression. It didn’t feel like he grew too much from each death. It didn’t feel like he got properly damaged, and when the show showed that he may have, it never actually solidified this kind of narrative progression. He just shifted from fiery MC to depressed boy and then was knocked out of that depression by some motivational speech. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[The Confession]

Rem spills her wish-fulfillment on Subaru and it’s probably the most I’ve ever cringed at an anime before. No hate towards anyone who enjoyed this sequence, but I just felt so uncomfortable. It felt like the most pandering possible thing to do. It’s wish-fulfillment. Really just a cute girl talking about this is made for guys to fawn over and that’s about it. 

With that being said, Subaru is self-aware about these flaws he has. Towards the latter half of this show there is an incredibly long emotional scene between Subaru and Rem. He dishes out just about everything he has taken, about the pain, the anger, the amount he’s been broken by these experiences. Whilst for me I didn’t buy his trials and tribulations since they lacked any kind of emotional resonance, I did feel like the VA did the best job he could’ve done conveying these feelings, though. Inopportunely, these feelings are based on a sub-par narrative. When a character admits his flaws, that’s the first step to overcoming them, right? 

Well, not for Re:Zero it’s not. He gets literally all of these flaws validated. Every single one. It’s supposed to be a parallel to how he helped Rem’s emotional breakdown, however, it doesn’t remotely feel like the same thing. Rem is straight up excusing everything he’s done just because she has fallen in love with him for an equally shallow reason that he’s fallen in love with Emilia. This kind of situation didn’t make much sense to me. They make these clear parallel’s yet do nothing with them, but more importantly, these parallels serve as a way to excuse actions that an MC who was made to be self-inserted into did. It’s the queen of all fan-service and pandering. Rem, the most waifu-bait character just validated everything that would be criticized of socially-incapable nerds. They give this corny quazi-relationship throughout a lot of this shows middle-half where Rem clearly has a big crush on him, and I suppose that gives her enough of a reason to fawn over him so much that she literally goes into cringe-inducing details about a fantasy relationship. It genuinely made me uncomfortable, which is funny since the actual scenes meant to make me uncomfortable couldn’t even do that. 
It’s a soap opera. Subaru is an awful person who does nothing yet takes the blame for everything and that’s portrayed as okay in this show. He does grow, but in ways that benefit the character. It frustrated me to no end. Regardless if he buys it or not, it happened. 

Here’s the saddest thing though. He rejects her. As I guessed from the first few episodes, Subaru’s heart lies with the cardboard cutout waifu and not the body-pillow waifu. Since he’s an anime protagonist and every girl is bound to warm up to him eventually, even Beatrice in this odd shoehorned scene of her expressing sadness over his inevitable death. So this rejection was then supplemented by Rem just kind of shrugging it off and then both of them laugh it off. 

I was just annoyed about this move. They had to address this relationship and made it seem like this crazy narrative maneuver but instead just made it an excuse for Rem to continue to fawn over Subaru with a potential tease of their possible relationship. It is frankly sickening how much Re:Zero wants to stick to a perceived status quo while still pretending to subvert clichés. This scene is there to maintain their relationship and the cutesy factor without actually addressing the core of the “MC can get em’ all” trope. It’s a cheap tactic that simply tries to, as I’ve said many times, have the cake and eat it too. It doesn’t work. Either be a sleazy harem or be a show with one relationship. This kind of unbelievable mushiness is there to serve as pandering fan service and is a detriment to original television. 

From here on every conversation Subaru has with Rem is just dripping with this kind of pandering bullshit that makes my eyes roll back. All they do is complement each other and pledge loyalty to one another and say how awesome they are over and over again. It’s a competition of who can be a massive suck up and it’s painful to listen to. It genuinely ruins my mood to see this gushy bullshit amidst a supposedly intense battle. They are trying too hard to keep this ship alive, and to my unwarranted surprise, people actually buy it. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[A Whale of a Climax]

The White Whale arc is cool. This is where I think the show finally could get to something that, while far from intense and original, was serviceable as entertainment. It ditched a lot of cloying nonsense and went for a direct threat-to-solve scenario. A massive White Whale was in the area and, of course, one of the previously established characters has a sad history of it. The first few episodes were slow and somewhat tedious, but the actual confrontation was, if anything, fun. 

I think it lacked quite a bit of tension as the battle never quite felt big, especially since the entire show falls into the Shounen trap of elongating these battle sequences with chatty expository dialogue mid-fight that not only rips me out of the moment, but stretch the believe-ability of the event. I think if Re:Zero would shorten this sequence down by three or maybe even four times, it could create for a more intense, believable, and well-animated battle. 

For shows like Game of Thrones, extended battle sequences work because there is a lot of narrative to cover. Well, that and just generally this is a lot more investment and believe-ability in the characters and setting.  But since the narrative is extremely simple in Re:Zero, there is no reason to have this. The battle episodes have dialogue that is generally contrived filler. Subaru didn’t really do anything apart from catching someone and saving them, and then pointing out an insanely obvious boss mechanic. This mechanic was so clear that it was extremely unbelievable that no one else thought of this. The “no one” I’m of course talking about the political figure that wasn’t one of the two that was portrayed with no shred of moral ground. 

Karsten Crusch is a pretty fun character to have on screen, even if her design is a little more uninspired than a lot of the other ones that the show has offered. She’s portrayed as this tactician and mastermind yet missed this mechanic completely, which made it all the clearer that the writer needed a reason to have Subaru be the one that is praised since he’s the protagonist of this show. That being said, it was a fun arc to have. Even if it felt like it was the most filler thing in the show, it was also probably the most fun I’ve had with this show that wasn’t’ the fifteenth episode. Things started to actually look up for Re:Zero. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[Anti-climax Within a Climax]

The show ends in a fairly anti-climactic way. We get an eventual reunion between Emilia and Subaru and the crazy joker gets defeated in a way that would probably feel cathartic to people invested in this story. There was this vague overarching narrative involving the seven deadly sins being represented that never actually felt tangible at all. They just felt like names tacked onto certain characters. Certain people were considered “sloth”, yet didn’t act slothful. This got to the point where Subaru points it out but it actually is a serious complaint that the show just glosses over because it was being meta. 

There are a few backstories reveals here both about the characters we know and about our protagonist, Subaru, that we could’ve probably figured out if we knew about this vague overarching narrative before it was introduced. I wish foreshadowing was something this show implemented. This isn’t really a bad way to go about things, but I can’t help and feel that it’s a generic route to venture down. 

This show offers a simplistic look at racism as well which serves no purpose other than to give Emilia another reason to get empathy from the viewer. It doesn’t work because it’s like empathizing with a cute pencil. Literally wooden. The racism isn’t ever portrayed in a way that I felt commented on anything apart from, “hey, don’t do that.” Which is the most simplistic and obvious way to go about commenting about something that is inherently thought of as a negative. 

However, we finally get a climax that doesn’t feel too interesting but we get the titular reunion of Subaru and Emilia and it’s everything that you could imagine. An overblown field of grass blowing in the wind with the sun’s rays outlining the characters as Subaru dumps his feelings on Emilia. She of course reciprocates in a nebulous way and the show wraps up. To give an example of this show lacking believability in its relationships I’ll cite one of the characters. During Subaru’s huge emotional confession to Emilia he says something to the extent of, “If you name ten bad things about yourself, I will name 2,000 things I love about you.” That’s nice in theory, however, I left me asking if he could even name five. I don’t actually think she even has five features, let alone two-thousand. She’s an ultra-hollow character that didn’t appear much in the show. She was a carrot on the stick that is sought after for reasons that aren’t believable. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

[Subversion, Deconstruction, and a Conclusion]

To return to the very first topic about this show. Is it subversive? Well, no. Not really. It doesn’t work to subvert anything that remotely lies within the narrative heart of these kinds of shows. There is no attempt to deconstruct elements of this archetype. This show relies heavily on meta-commentary as humor, rather than actual commentary on narrative. I can’t say Re:Zero isn’t trying to do this, since I don’t know if it is, but it sure as hell is failing if it is.

I think the plot-holes and narrative leaps this show has are enough to dismiss it, but pile that on top of the miles of pandering content and cloying narrative with unbelievable relationships you get a show that is overrated by a wide audience. That being said, it isn’t without its positives. I appreciate its character design, they fit exactly what this show is trying to do very well. Particularly Emilia and the twin maids have standout designs. The VA’s are also mostly solid, with some great performances by Yuusuke Kobayashi playing Subaru, and Inori Minase as Rem. It also does a few smart things when it comes to presentation. I particularly loved how it avoided the opening credits in some cases to maintain the pace of the narrative. This is something I haven’t seen done in anime much and I’d love to see more shows attempt this. 	

I think Re:Zero shows a glaring flaw in this entire kind of entertainment. A lot of anime can often feel shallow to me. I usually am unable to pinpoint why exactly I’m having trouble connecting to these characters, especially since animation is a medium in which I connect to characters more due to their overt expressiveness. I often ponder this question without ever coming up with an answer, however, I feel like I can finally describe it in maybe an overly simplistic way. 

Anime is the only medium in which I hear the term “best girl” being thrown around. It’s the only kind of entertainment where the quality of one, and only one, sex matters over a lot of significantly more important things for many people. It’s this kind of strange shallowness that is pandered to relentlessly since the industry knows the kind of demographic it’s attempting to appeal to that keeps it from being taken seriously by a lot of people. It is a show like Re:Zero that stretches my ability to consider this as anything but an elaborate ruse to have me spend money because I thought some cartoon girl was pretty and had a cute blush and a childish voice. It appeals to this basic instinct and doesn’t rely on its ability to tell a story. People get bored of watching the same shit, even if that same narrative shit is secondary to how attractive the characters are. So, when they see something like this, which has objective narrative issues, but at least conveys a different kind of mindset, they may view it as something more. Especially since it’s still delivering a barrage of girls acting in a way only anime girls can act. 

Regardless of whether you think this is an issue or not, I feel like it is a topic that is worth discussing. So, why is subversion needed? To create entertainment that isn’t a slave to an industry. You need subversion because it undermines the power of an established kind of media structure. However, do not confuse subversion with self-awareness or just unexpected outcomes. Being unexpected is simply what a story needs to be if you want it to be engaging. You need to keep things unpredictable to a certain extent if you want to keep the viewers engaged. 

Re:Zero is far from a narrative masterpiece that many people may believe it to be. It is, however, a show that tries to defy conventions while still ticking off every checkbox of its clichéd genre. It’s something we’ve seen many times before yet it plays out with just a few differences that make it something worth remembering just a little. It’s not something that I overtly enjoyed, however, I will say that I will remember my time watching Re:Zero. 

I wish that I had more positives to say about the show that was the craze of 2016, however, I also wish it left me with a more positive impression. I don’t think I’ll forget Re:Zero, but I can’t really tell why. It’s a piece of entertainment that feels Re:Made countless times, Re:Packaged into different archetypes, Re:Written for different generations, but ultimately remains Un:Inspired."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=3,Not Recommended,"Rezero is easily the most popular anime of Spring 2016, it’s your typical isekai anime but it comes with a twist, that twist being that it has a time travelling aspect. Yup, an anime that’s involving time travelling, nothing could possibly go wrong riiiiight?

So what makes this show so popular? Well, the story follows a guy named Subaru who got randomly teleported into another world, why does he get teleported into another world? Who knows, its magic. Funnily enough he acts as if teleporting into another world is a completely normal thing to happen, he didn’t give a single shit on why he got teleported
                  ...
into another world and instead tries to be this genre savvy character where he acts pretty self-aware of what’s going on. From there we meet our 1st waifu bait, Emillia. Without any knowledge of what’s going on, Subaru decided to help Emillia, and by doing that we finally encountered this show’s twist, that twist being that Subaru has the ability to go back in time every single time he died, basically, he’s invisible, This is probably the worst thing you can give to a character.

By giving a character an ability to basically redo everything till he gets it right basically kills any potential suspense that this show could of have since Subaru actions literally have no consequences because he can just redo everything and try to do things right. And I know what some of you are thinking right now “Bb-but Farrel! If you keep dying constantly it will result a psychological damage thus making you depressed and that’s what makes Subaru so “Realistic”. Pft yeah right, the psychological strain is just melodrama that gets out of its way with the power of friendship (Or with the power of a Lap pillow LOL). His mood swings are so quick that it is hardly believable, forget about realistic. He has a breakdown, then it's resolved within an episode or two. Constantly doing that makes the consequences feel tame and do not have impact because they constantly has not well executed breakdowns then resolves them with just as bad execution. 

I think that the people who considered Subaru as a “Realistic character” is referring to the fact that Subaru is a completely useless character and that makes at least 90% of the people who watch rezero easier to self-insert themselves because it’s relatable to them.

Okay enough with Subaru, let’s move on to the more crucial problem that this anime had, that being the storyline. Rezero’s setting is entirely reliant on the supernatural power, that being the teleportation. What was it that triggered Subaru's transportation? Why Subaru of all people? Of course it didn’t get explained, are you really expecting a show where the author does whatever he asspulls every 5 minutes to give us a logical explanation? Lol, keep dreaming.

>inb4 someone tries to justify it by saying “It’s all explained in the Novel!! xDD”
Sorry, but saying that “It’s explained in the novel” Is not a valid argument. You should understand that we’re not talking about the novel here. The light novel and the anime are two completely different entities as they should be. A novel is not to an anime what a guide or a manual is to a videogame, so please dont try to justify how shit this anime is by saying that all explained in the source material.

Another problem that this show suffers is they rely on shock factor to make this show more “Interesting”. If we take a look at the early episodes, it took Subaru MORE THAN 2 TIMES to figure out that he has the ability to travel back in time. It’s quite ironic how they show Subaru as this genre savvy character in the 1st episode, where he’s pretty self-aware that he’s being teleported into another world, but it took him that much time to realize that he’s stuck in a loop.

 Of course they are doing this just to show us that this show is edgy, they torture Subaru so that the people have the impression that this show is dark when it is not. I’m sorry but adding torture to your main character every episode in a whole arc with no actual story progression or content does not equal a good subversion. And they didn’t stop there, they have to torture Subaru again in the later episode where one of the maids has a suspicion on Subaru, and then guess what Rem did? That’s right, She kills him. If one is suspicious, wouldn’t any individual go ahead and try and reinforce those suspicions with facts and an ounce of sense, things which they have garnered throughout an investigation? Of course that’s not what rem did, but instead, she kills him. Oh wow, what a dark show we have here everyone. 

If you don’t do anything more than killing or torturing characters, it will get boring very fast because the audience will get over the initial shock, and eventually get used to it. Plus, we know that Subaru is not going to literally die anyway, so why do we even care at this point?

Another thing that’s quite ironic about this show is that the author said that he wants to critique the whole isekai genre, but he doesn’t do that at all. Infact he did the complete opposite, he basically did everything that he wants to “Critique”.

In conclusion, rezero is nothing different from any other generic light novel adaptations out there, it tries to be something different, but fails miserably. The show is relying entirely on the plot convenience and cheap ass shock factor to get the story in motion . All the characters can be summed up in a word; they're cliche and the story hasn't utilised anything or even the time reset aspect, it's more a way for the story to get to point a to point b faster than anything. The setting is dry bland and bleak as ever. I won’t recommend this show to anyone unless you’re one of those people that are easily impressed by some cheap ass shock factor and a premise that’s too reliant on constant plot twists in order to keep the viewer seated."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS.
It should be treated more as a critique for those who have already finished or do not plan to watch the show and are browsing for opinions, rather than a ""Should You Watch"".

INTRO: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. At one point, I had high hopes for this series. It was announced to much fanfare and excitement from source Light Novel readers who hailed it as an intelligent deconstruction of the Isekai (Parallel World (typically) fantasy) genre/setting, oft-mocked for being oversaturated by mediocre tales of self-insertable Gary Stus flung into fantasy worlds and quickly finding themselves with a harem and overpowered
                  ...
abilities. Despite this, I should point out that I generally bear no ill will towards Isekai series despite these criticisms, and have no issues enjoying them if they are executed well enough. Overall though, I do agree that the genre is laden with tired tropes, and I was looking forward to seeing how Re:Zero would topple or at least subvert them as advertised. Unfortunately, that is not quite what I got out of it.

Watching this series was certainly a unique experience. I struggle to remember the last time such a well-received anime so utterly baffled me in the complete disconnect between its supposed intent and its delivery (with perhaps the sole exception at the time of writing being the first season of Oregairu, though that is a story for another day). It is a story with so many blatant contradictions woven into that I could not help but assume that it was a deliberately satirical work, and yet it is clearly meant to be taken at face value. Were it not for the comparatively exciting and entertaining presentation of the first arc in episodes 1 through 3, I would have most assuredly give this show a sum score of 1/10. That is how much ill will I hold towards this show and its betrayal of expectations. It is so consummately deplorable that I feel compelled to waste my time writing this, my first MAL review. Though I have heard various opinions regarding the quality of the anime adaptation versus the light novel, I will be treating the show as an independent product with no comparisons to source material. Contradiction and contrast, as I said before, is the name of the game here, and will be the central themes of this review.

ART AND ANIMATION: Let's begin here. In the typical anime, particularly one with fight scenes, the quality of the art and animation is understandably expected to fluctuate due to time and budget constraints. The greatest peaks can be expected to occur during the attention-grabbing climactic episodes of the first arc and last arc, with smaller peaks throughout. However, that is not what happened in this series. Though the animation in episode 3 (the end of the first arc) has some particularly striking moments, it is in fact one of the only episodes I would label as noteworthy throughout the entire show. There are many instances throughout the series of significant scenes that are weakened by lack of detail and/or fluidity. The series also makes ample use of CG elements, such as the crowds in towns, that do not blend in well at all. Most viewers, myself included, would likely forgive this, simply assuming that they are conserving their resources for another set piece moment. Yet... that moment never comes. No battle scene ever comes close to that of episode 3, in animation or even in dramatic tension. After it was all over, I felt cheated, as though I had been bait-and-switched by episode 3 and its glimmer of potential, waiting for a return to form that simply never arrived.

Apart from more objective qualms, the series also makes very heavy use of less-than-subtle visual metaphors and direction cues in an attempt to stir emotion. Examples include: supposedly emotional moments being punctuated by rays of light and brightness filters that look like they would be right at home on Instagram or a JJ Abrams film, a single flower conveniently left blooming on the barren battlefield to segue into a floral-themed flashback scene, frequent use of flashback flickers in almost any conversation where past events are even lightly touched upon, and a literal flock of doves during a particularly forced emotional scene. While not dealbreaking flaws, these heavy-handed additions certainly detracted from my viewing experience.

SOUND DESIGN AND MUSIC: The series often opted to skip the OP, the ED, or both, presumably in an ill-advised attempt to cram in more dialogue or events into each episode, so I never got particularly attached to any of them. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the OPs and EDs more were they actually played more than about 3 times each in their respective single cour runs of 12-13 episodes. This was especially evident when the show went for ""OP drops"" during critical scenes, and I would suddenly hear a vaguely familiar song I had not heard in several episodes, not realizing for several moments when I had heard it before. In my opinion, the decision to shun the general convention of ~1:30 Opening > ~20 Minute Episode > ~1:30 Ending is not something that should be taken lightly, as eschewing the traditional restrictions on the medium in a ""director's cut"" fashion often leads to issues with pacing or bloat, along with the aforementioned issues of song memorability. It's a shame, because they were fairly unique as far as OP/ED tracks go. 

As for the OST, a few tracks were of note, but their impact was often dulled due to being used in conjunction with the heavy-handed visual direction I was not a fan of. In those same scenes where the lighting was turned up to max, more emotionally charged music tracks would be played at a noticeably higher volume than the usual. In many scenes, I found myself irritated and distracted that the show was TELLING me how to feel about what was going on on-screen instead of allowing me to form my own opinions. It was almost as though the show was accompanied by a commentator shouting at me ""Hey! Look, this scene is sad!"" or ""Oh man! Things are getting heated!"" at regular intervals. Most shows do this to some extent, and it is difficult to describe in words why exactly this show in particular was so egregious, but the real problems came when what the show was telling me to feel directly contradicted with how I was actually feeling about the scene.

STORY: The premise of Re:Zero is actually quite interesting. The ""hero"" is thrust into the fantasy world, but does not possess any hidden overpowered talents. He has the ability to reset, but not without very serious drawbacks. Subaru wishes to be just like the heroes of typical Isekai stories, in self-referential meta fashion, but finds himself grossly underprepared to do so, and this is how the story begins. The first arc, the Auction House Arc, is very fast-paced and clear-cut. As Subaru awakens in the new world, he has several immediate issues that need resolving. First, getting his bearings in an unfamiliar environment. Second, discovering and understanding his ""Return by Death"" ability. And third, discovering and preventing the sinister threat lurking at the auction house. Though I have my complaints of how Emilia is introduced and immediately converted into a forced plot device with whom Subaru is instantly infatuated with and motivated to act for, the conflict is developed organically from there, with these three elements introduced and expanded upon simultaneously in a fairly sensible manner. This is, without a doubt, the peak of Re:Zero's storytelling. Sadly, as the show goes on, the plot becomes progressively less focused, less interesting, and more longwinded with each new arc. The second arc, the Mansion/Maid Arc, has two main conflicts, the mystery of the curse and the mystery of the killer with the flail. By the end of the arc, it's clear that both conflicts had very little impact on the plot and world as a whole. Instead, they were meant as character development for Subaru and the new characters, especially Rem. It's not necessarily a bad thing for a show to treat overall plot progression within an arc as a secondary to character development. However, that is only true if the character development is interesting or satisfying in some way, or if it helps to develop sympathy for a character's situation.

It is very difficult to sympathize with Subaru in this arc, despite his gruesome deaths and mounting paranoia. Throughout the arc, Subaru's rapidly unraveling mental stability as he is struggling to make sense of why he keeps ""resetting"" is conceptually interesting, if not perfectly executed. However, it is difficult to truly root for Subaru when he makes a point of making exceptionally rude comments to almost every individual he meets for the first time, and enjoys showboating and generally making himself appear highly suspect during a canonically tense time where everyone is wary of spies and traitors. It is also hard to feel surprised or sympathetic when Subaru finds himself dismayed and shocked at the mistrust -- and worse -- that he receives. This is compounded by the extremely harsh contrast between drama and awful ""humor"" in some episodes, as well as Subaru's panic being portrayed through his increasingly frequent, very loud, very grating, false displays of bravado. I understood what they were going for, but it doesn't feel natural or well-done at all. On the other hand it's also quite difficult to see why Subaru feels so attached so quickly to those antagonizing him, despite having little to no significant conversation with them. His shift from utter fear and distrust to gratitude and compassion is so abrupt and ill-considered that it's more comical than the show's actual attempts at humor. This will be elaborated upon in the Characters section.

STORY (cont): The third arc, the Whale/Cultist arc, is by far the longest of the three. And yet, there are again only two or three main conflicts, and they certainly aren't any more compelling or developed than those of the second arc even given the extra runtime. Not only does this arc quickly introduce and abandon the Royal Selection subplot, which is the first truly significant event that could move the overall story forward, it takes an entire cour to tell its story, if it can be called that. By the end of the arc it did not feel like much ground had been covered at all, even compared to the first arc, which had perhaps a quarter of the runtime, if that. This is where my dislike of the ""director's cut"" approach comes in. The frequent cutting of the OP and ED was presumably done to fit in more story, so it is baffling to see how much time was actually wasted on drawn out exposition and repetition. Several antagonists are revealed in this arc, all tied to the Jealous Witch and her Cult, but are all either so uninteresting or so over-the-top villainous that it is really difficult to care at all about what is happening. The way the resets are presented, each antagonist is introduced and reintroduced several times before the conflict is resolved, taking away all gravity from their final appearances. Even the final battle of the series is underwhelming, and not just because of the fairly unimpressive animation, as mentioned earlier, but because that enemy had already shown up and been ""defeated"" multiple times in rather anti-climactic fashion, draining all potential excitement for his last duty as a jobber. Even after all of the conflicts are resolved, the finale of the third arc, much like the second arc, leaves the overall progression of the plot at nearly the same place that it began. There is some minor development of character relationships between Subaru and the side characters, most of which consists of Subaru making them hate him, and then trying to make amends, but that's all. By the end, we know about as much of the world, Subaru's ""condition"", and the motivations of each important character as we did when they were introduced.

And yet, that still is not the worst of it. Despite the fact that, episode for episode, the story of the second cour moves quite slowly in comparison to the first and does not contribute to the plot progression, it still somehow feels rushed. Along the way, Subaru spends a significant portion of each episode rebounding between drowning in self-loathing and defeat, to soaring on hubris and bombast. These mood swings into depression are typically triggered by yet another death, which by this point in the series are tossed out like candy and are harder to care about each time. Each time this happens Subaru then receives a pep talk from a character who notices his despair, which cheers him up until the next soul-crushing event happens. I would estimate that, on average, each episode in the second cour contains 1-2 such pep talks, with the final speech-giver tally including almost every side character of any significance. This gets repetitive quickly and takes up quite a bit of runtime. Despite this series getting two cours, two extra-long episodes for the intro and finale, and skipping the majority of its OPs and EDs, conflict resolution still feels rushed. Every time an issue was resolved for good, I found myself questioning if that was really it. All of these factors combine in a way that, when viewed as a whole, gives the feeling of a story that hits the ground running, but then spends two cours slowly choking and grinding to a painfully dull stop.

CHARACTERS: Suffice it to say, I felt that the characterization in this anime was some of the worst I have ever experienced in any medium, and certainly not remotely worthy of being hailed as deconstructive or subversive where tropes are concerned. In fact, the characters I enjoyed watching the most were mainly just entertaining side characters that had very little plot relevance, such as Wilhelm, Beatrix, and Ram. This is because, paradoxically, the more personal interaction a character had with Subaru, the less sensible or developed they felt as a character. Then there are characters such as Felix, whose crossdressing habits seem to be purely for viewer pandering towards fans of ""trap"" character. There is not the slightest hint towards progressive themes or rationale that could suggest otherwise and make Felix an interesting character, an odd choice for a show supposedly avoiding typical character tropes. To make things easier on myself, I will split the focus of this section into three pieces for the characters I believe shoulder the burden for the vast majority of the criticism I can level against this series: Emilia, Rem, and, of course, Subaru.

EMILIA: Emilia truly bordered the line between main heroine and non-character. Despite the series repeatedly pointing out that she is an independent and powerful Spirit Arts user who is more than capable of defending herself, the way she is presented in the series is not all that different from a damsel in distress. These are the main facets of her character: Subaru's savior who was the first to reach out to him (this is the peak of her character, and it lasts for exactly one episode -- the first episode); Subaru's ideal girl that he wants to get closer to; the girl Subaru most wants to save from danger (this is the most common way she is presented and is a major motivator for Subaru throughout the show); the girl who sometimes acts cold, but is actually just suffering due to prejudice that Subaru wishes to defend her from; the girl who gets angry at Subaru but has a soft spot for him and is inwardly worried sick about him. There is an obvious common thread between all of these. Emilia's character, despite the show's protest to the contrary, is solely defined by what Subaru is doing at any given moment, and how his actions relate to her wellbeing. She is treated essentially as the trophy Subaru wishes to win for his victory against cruel fate. While she is not particularly unlikable, she is also far too pristine and unbelievably irreproachable to be compelling. Everything that Emilia is simply comes together to form the ""perfect"" heroine for Subaru to fight for, and she is never developed beyond that.

REM: As much as Emilia was a forced ""perfect"" heroine and romantic interest candidate, Rem is a thousand times more so. She is introduced without much characterization at all, and what characterization we first get is that she truly hates Subaru. She resents Subaru who has shown up and taken up residence in her home with suspicious intentions, even staining the mansion with the ""Scent of the Witch"" she hates so much. She resents him so much, that she is more than willing to murder him, and refuses to listen to his ""excuses"". The way the series treats her character and relationship with Subaru from there on is, in a word, contradictory. First, Subaru is to be given a reason to fight for this girl who, even given his many repeats, he has known for a matter of weeks. And on Rem's side, she must be given a reason to appear sympathetic despite displaying murderous intent towards someone who, in her timeline, she has known for less than a week. Surely, such a feat would be quite difficult, given the established relationship they share. Suddenly, in an amazing feat of Deus ex machina, Subaru has a flashback to a memory he didn't even know he had, reminding him that Rem and her sister held his hands at his bedside when he was ill. The striking realization of this truly earth-shattering display of human compassion is apparently enough to overwrite the fact that she literally murdered him, so much so that Subaru becomes more than willing to die to save her. And that's just the beginning. In a single episode, Rem is given the opportunity to dump a 10 minute monologue of tragic backstory that, again, apparently redeems her past homicidal actions unconditionally. And then Subaru responds with a canned motivational speech to cheer her up, which somehow shakes Rem so deep down to the very core of her being, that she instantly falls completely and madly in love with him.

Everything in the show up to this point, I could forgive. Rem's backstory was fairly enjoyable, and was certainly the most development a single character gets in this entire series. I can certainly understand that she, who has lived her whole life trusting basically no one but her sister, would be moved by Subaru's kindness, even if that kindness came in the form of a generic support message. I can even entertain the possibility that this could lead to her giving Subaru another chance to make her trust him, and lead to her opening up to and maybe even falling in love with him, given the proper additional development. What I truly cannot comprehend is that I, as the viewer, am expected to believe that this single backstory dump and the speech Subaru makes in response justifies making Rem into a completely different character overnight. So much so, that in the span of perhaps two weeks to a month in-universe, she now has an exhaustive mental list of all of Subaru's best traits, and all the things that made her hate and want to kill him are now ""so cute"". So much so, that, in that span of time, she has prepared an entire itinerary for how she and Subaru could elope and spend the rest of their lives together in idyllic happiness. So much so, that every word she speaks in favor of Subaru directly contradicts how she acted not a month prior.

And the worst part is, the show is actively cognizant of this fact. There are instances where Rem, after a marked moment of hesitation, proudly proclaims her ability to discern the truth behind Subaru's words at any given moment, or that she has never once doubted Subaru's intentions despite to the ""Scent of the Witch"" lingering on him due to the revival curse. Both of these are direct contradictions to actions she took in the past, such as literally murdering him without giving him a chance to explain himself. It's so absurdly contradictory that I initially truly believed that she was supposed to be a satirical deconstruction of typical Isekai heroines, unhealthily affectionate towards and dependent on the first man to ever show her genuine kindness. I thought her character had the most potential to be genuinely interesting, and was curious to see how she would be developed. But as the show went on, I realized that it was all just a pipe dream, and that the show clearly did not see anything strange about her character. With how close Rem and Subaru get, and all the tender hugs and nose-nuzzling moments they share as the series goes on, a viewer seeing their new relationship out of context would be hard pressed to think that Rem is anything other than the primary love interest. But oh, how wrong they would be.

SUBARU: This is it. The crux of the review. Everything prior led up to this singular purpose and end goal: to provide the appropriate context to discuss why Subaru is one of, if not the worst anime protagonists I have ever had the misfortune of watching, and for 25 excruciating episodes at that. As Subaru is a difficult character to sum up, I will instead follow his characterization as the show progressed, from beginning to end. But first, some disclaimers. I am fully aware of the concept that Subaru is intended to be a flawed protagonist. I understand that he is supposed to be a ""weak"" character who does not have the typical hidden reserve of power that an Isekai protagonist is expected to have. I understand that he is supposed to be an ordinary guy who is placed under the extreme mental duress of experiencing countless painful deaths. I understand this, but despite all that, he is still a truly awful character.

In the first arc, Subaru is actually pretty decent. He is rather annoying, loud, cocky, and brash, but if you do accept what the story is telling you, its not that hard to believe. You know that he is operating under the presumption of being a NEET who is finally living the dream, summoned to a fantasy world to save the realm and get the girl. You know that, while weak by fantasy standards, he is actually fairly physically capable and quick thinking as far as normal humans go. As the first arc progresses, he is humbled by his lack of power and accepts it, resolving not to give up despite that. He understands that he put Emilia on a pedestal, but still believes that she is someone worth saving. I actually like the Subaru of the first arc. Everything changes as soon as the mansion arc begins. From the outset, Subaru seems to have completely forgotten all notions of caution and wariness he had just finished picking up. He bursts through the mansion, laughing and often insulting or harassing its occupants. Even after learning of the country's precarious state, and being told outright how suspicious he appears as a traveler of mysterious origins, his behavior does not change. He is unable to grasp why he is being targeted, and instead of confronting the situation directly, continues ""trying harder"" in the hopes that the winds of fortune will somehow blow in his favor. Finally, he calms down, overcomes the trauma and panic, and buckles down to work together with those who suspect him to solve the problem.

At this point, I thought the worst was over, and he had finally developed as a character. But again, I was wrong. At the start of the third arc, he once again regresses as a character, so far backwards that he is in an even worse position than the Subaru at the beginning of the show. I suppose the explanation is that he was soaring on the high of victory from arc two, but that is not enough to explain how he once again completely forgot everything he learned and backed himself into a corner. Completely ignoring his promise with Emilia, Rem's advice, and even Julius', a third party's, warnings, he humiliates both Emilia and himself in his misguided quest to act as a heroic knight. This would perhaps be acceptable, had he not supposedly overcome this hubris on two separate occasions in the previous arcs. Even a flawed character has limits. If I really stretched my patience, I would still be able to accept the situation were it clear that Re:Zero is a deconstruction, and Subaru was rightly debased for his wrongdoings. Instead, after the fallout, we get scenes of Emilia regretting being ""too harsh"" on him, and Rem comforting him and telling him he had the right intentions. What follows is four full episodes of Subaru once again proceeding down the wrong path, despite both verbal and physical beatings and chastisings from other characters on multiple occasions. Again, even for a flawed character, there are limits to what is acceptable before it becomes gratuitous. It got so bad, that the only way to make Subaru a sympathetic protagonist again was to introduce a villain that was so comically off-the-rails psychotic and evil that Subaru couldn't be anything but the hero.

Somehow, even up to this point, I was willing to accept Subaru as merely ""a bad character"" the kind of generic throwaway used in many shows, ironically the type Re:Zero supposedly satires. And then I watched everyone's favorite episode. Driven to the breaking point, Subaru asks Rem to run away with him and start a new life together. Rem, though very flattered and tempted, refuses to accept, knowing that Subaru's heart was not in the request. What followed was a long sequence of Subaru berating himself with surprising accuracy, and Rem comforting him with the the aforementioned praise and affection. I thought maybe, finally, Subaru had awoken for the last time, and become the protagonist he was meant to be, the protagonist that should have already existed after arc one. Instead, I got that line. That infamous line that was so egregious, it spawned countless memes: ""I love Emilia."" This character, this man, had just finished listening to Rem pour out her misguided feelings, after first directly asking her to run away with him, and his first reaction after getting his spirits back up due to said girl was to reject her.

Even then, even after all of this, I still naively thought the worst had passed. Instead, the Subaru of the following episodes acted in the following ways: asking Rem to support him in his quest to win Emilia's heart (she smiles and calls him terrible while he laughs it off); asking Rem for a knife to carve his and Emilia's names on a tree; nuzzling noses with Rem after a rescue; outright telling Crusch that he has a #1 and #2 girl in his heart. By this point, Subaru had transcended my worst imagination, and gone from a simple flawed character, to an absolute scumbag. But the series never acknowledges this as wrong. In the final episodes, everyone, including Rem, treats Subaru as the hero he always wanted to be perceived as. We even get a heartwarming confession scene from Subaru to Emilia that was so similar in tone to the scene with Rem, it was as though the series pretended that the previous confession had simply never occurred. The way Re:Zero condones Subaru's near two-timing behavior and his treatment of Rem actively promotes the idea that it's okay for a guy to perpetuate an emotionally abusive relationship with an emotionally unstable girl who debases herself and accepts that she is his second choice, but still idolizes the guy just because he reached out to her once when she was vulnerable. This was what I found to be the absolute most vile and deplorable aspect of this already flawed show.

Sometimes, when I think about the time I wasted watching and thinking about this dreadful anime, I wonder if I would like to have the Return by Death ability myself, if only so that I could kill myself and reclaim that lost time and blissful ignorance. But honestly speaking, knowing that a show this offensive and terrible exists serves as a great benchmark, and makes me appreciate the ones that I like even more. 2/10."

""Any anime that seeks to be popular has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.""

That isn't to say that anyone who enjoyed this is stupid. Just to say that this show caters to stupid people. And that is to say that it's some pretty lowest common denominator stuff. And I'm explaining that so that I don't get slapped on the wrist for insulting people.

Now that I've insulted ""the best anime of spring 2016, the year, the decade, and possibly of all time"", I'm going to take some time to state why
                  ...
I disagree with this statement, before breaking down into a slander based rant where I compare this anime to 3 month old dick cheese.

I'm off to a fantastic start, aren't I?

(spoiler warning.)

Re:Zero is a show that is often overblown. It is called a psychological masterpiece when Subaru has a mental breakdown, an action masterpiece when they kill a whale. It is said to be a character-driven emotional epic where the main character reacts realistically to what happens around him. And yes, while it does have its moments, it isn't nearly as good as people make it out to be.

I want to start off by addressing that this show is no different from the ""generic overpoewered mc"" trope. Before you lynch me, let me explain. Subaru is often said to be a protagonist who is not overpowered, and has to struggle to achieve his goal since he has no ""trump card"" or superhuman strength that will triple in power to help him defeat his enemies. However, while he isn't subject to a sudden power up, he is constantly subject to ridiculous plot convenience at every corner. The show lasts all of 10 minutes before he meets Satella, a magic user and her familiar Puck, and befriends them both. Our merry band of three then go off on a journey to get back something Satella lost. On their way, they save a little girl (hooray for good deeds) who the turns out to be the daughter of the store owner they met earlier, who apparently knows exactly the information that they need (boo for using said good deed as a cheap plot advancement technique). The point of this ridiculous paragraph is that Subaru didn't have to use his ridiculously big brain or his ultra technique to solve the problem- he just needed to wait for things to fall into his lap. Just like with how it then turns out that Satella is actually Emilia, and she also just happens to be living in a mansion with a rich lord willing to employ Subaru for his services, and also happens to be a candidate for Queen of the kingdom. And as soon as it began, Subaru's struggle to make a place for himself in society via struggling for things he has not earned has ended with his superpower- not Return by Death, but by the superpower of plot convenience.

And this isn't an isolated case. This happens throughout the anime, other cases being anytime Beatrice does anything (thank you, helpful loli of plot advancement. We'll need you until we're not in the mansion anymore), Reinhardt showing up in the store to prevent the crazy knife girl from killing Subaru because he ""just so happened to be in the neighborhood"".

Moving on to the ridiculous edge factor. The constant over the top bloodsplosions and limbs flying off comically reminded me of Akame ga Kill, a show constantly called ""2edgy4me"" and ""reliant on over the top gore for shock"". However, when it's in Re:Zero, the same thing is praised for being ""horrifying"" and is generally thought of as adding to the show. I am not trying to say that any gore is edgy- but Re:Zero's use of gore definetly is. Gore should be a ""show, don't tell"" aspect of a show. It's the icing on a violence cake. It isn't the cake itself. Re: Zero constantly shoves how gory it is in your face. Each fight is secondary to the blood spilled during it. There is one genuinely disturbing moment in its violence, and that's when Rem gets twisted up like a pretzel. Although that moment is immediately ruined by the fact that recently-made-into-a-pretzel Rem drags herself to Subaru comically thanks to the power of love.

For a show that has a love affair with violence and making its main character watch his friends die, it's super scared of actually having anyone die (and yes, I am aware of the ""it"" that happens in the light novels and think that not including ""it"" in an anime that has no confirmed season 2 as of yet is a good idea). Death of characters loses its meaning when you are looking for the shock factor in the character's death not in the death itself, but how the character will die this time. Death also loses its meaning when it's happening all the time and has no consequences. It doesn't matter if someone dies, because they will be back. Characters here elude the reaper via Subaru returning or straight up ignoring death. Unless you're a side character, in which case fuck you and die a gory death for shock value.

But enough of that. Time to bitch about characters.

Subaru is constantly a happy-go-lucky-devoted-to-his-companions type until they visit the royal city, where he starts letting his ego get out of check, resulting in A Very Bad Time for all involved. Seriously, the way he behaves in the royal court made me physically cringe. Maybe that was the point. Seriously, who acts like that at a royal court where all of the top officials in the land are? It's the equivalent of walking into the UN and doing the same thing. Doesn't matter how much of prick the people may be, you don't act like that at a place that is deciding the equivalent of the fate of the world. Regardless, after making an absolute fool of himself and getting beaten up by Purple hair fujoshi bait while Red hair fujoshi bait looks on all sad-like that his friend is getting beat up, Subaru undergoes a transformation and becomes the new and improved Subaredgy, who likes to believe that without his godly intervention, nothing will go right. Which would've been a really good change, if not for the fact he becomes an insufferable tool out of nowhere, for no reason. It isn't even a result of him having to deal with a whole lot of shit like getting killed by Rem, dying of mana exhaustion, etc. He was fine all that time in the mansion despite what he went through. For him to suddenly develop this new personality because Julius called out on his behavior and the beat him up for trashing the name of the knights of the kingdom (the equivalent of shitting on soldiers) is unreasonable and stupid. This new personality also causes his intelligence to regress, making him attempt to have Princesses who control armies and businesses with great success bend to his will because he simply wants them to rather than thinking of how to navigate the political climate. And this all lasts until Rem gives a great speech to him to cheer him up. And then he's back to his happy-go-lucky self. And despite realising how he can't do anything because he doesn't have the fighting skills or magic skills to help. And he still doesn't attempt to learn them, leaving others to do the work for him. The one time he does attempt to learn it is when he is Subaredgy, and gives up soon after he changes back to regular Subaru.

There is a constant slew of characters who are introduced and do almost nothing of note despite how much of an impact is seems they will have when they are introduced. Here lies Felt, Priscilla, Anastasia, Aldebaran, Beatrice, Russel Fellow, Elsa, Roswaal, and Old Man Rom (and to a certain extent, Ram).

But by far the worst character has to be Betelgeuse. Rapey weirdos who lick people weren't okay in Sword Art Online, and they shouldn't be okay here. Betelgeuse is a jarring addition to the cast, constantly talking about his brain trembling and pulling weird poses and munching his fingers and talking about how slothful people and having a crush on the Jealous Witch and not much else. Props to the VA though. He was fantastic. Made Betelgeuse actually bearable.
Betelgeuse is constantly built up to be the ultimate bad guy of the series, someone who is seriously bad news. and in the 4 episodes they actually go out of their way to fight him, he is constantly killed ridiculously easily. It took double the amount of episodes for Subaru to be able to leave Roswaal's mansion alive (which brings me to another gripe, it took 12 episodes to introduce the first major plot point, which is the Queen candidate story. 12 episodes. half the series. What.).

Rem and Emilia are the least grating of the lot, but that's because they're the waifu bait. They need to be likeable. problem is, Emilia disappears right after episode 13 and only reappears in episode 23. 10 episodes of the main love interest disappearing leads to what happened- people start supporting Rem as the main love interest rather than Emilia, which is sad, because Subaru and Emilia had a bunch of really good moments, which all evaporated in the wake of a 10 episode disappearance.
Rem has the problem of literally trying to murder Subaru in episode 6. How can a show where what happens has a ""psychological effect on the main character"" brush this off the very next episode because ""she held my hand when I was having a nightmare""? It just doesn't make sense.

Truthfully, Re:Zero is a bad show. Not truly bad, but also definitely not amazing or deserving of being called the ""best"". And it sure as shit would've been a better show if not for the constant outpouring of praise from those who watched it.

Not the best of its season. That's Boku no Hero Academia. Not the best of its year- that could be Konosuba, Boku no Hero Academia, ReLife, or Shokugeki S2. Definitely not the best of the decade, when you share the decade with shows like Katanagatari, Bakuman, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Anohana, Nichijou, Usagi Drop, and Fate/zero. And that's just 2010/2011.

Re:Zero is show that got popular for a good reason. One that I'll never understand."

So my this is my first review , thank you for reading and hope it would be helpful :D
Watch out may contain spoilers 

**********************************************************

I've watched allot of anime's by now , and after a while you get to a point that by the first episode of any anime you can just anticipate what going to happen , how to story will unfold , who is the main character , and how will it end .

It all start as any other anime , suddenly the hero is summoned to another fantasy world without any kind of preparation .
It continues as any other anime also , the
                  ...
main character gets into a bind ,trying to figure out why and how all of this happening .
You are waiting to see what will be his amazing power that has been gifted to him , probably to save this new universe hes been sent to.
By the 3rd episode every thing its very normal , but then it all starts to fall apart , this new power he has changes every thing and its not the power you would expect for a Main character to have in this situation .

By the Synopsis there already is in this anime you already can guess what his power is , ( I haven't read it so I was totally surprised , recommend you to skip the Synopsis also ).
After the first time we have been showed his power the story starts to take a turn , not bad but at the same time not good either  , I would say twisted turn but that reason is why it got me right at the begging and wanted to see more how would this turn out in the end . 

After a while , by episode 10 it started to get the Psychological part of the anime , and surprised me completely with a new view that you barely see in a main character.

Overall my point is that this anime has a new fresh story that you dont see very often , the main character finds himself in a new universe getting some amazing power with it , saving the universe from evil and gets the girl in the end and every thing ends up happy .

No you dont see this on Re:zero , If you plan to watch this get ready for , Death ,Blood , Psychological breakdowns , and just twisted plot changes that you just dont expect them to see .

And like I mentioned at the start of this review , that by now if you have seen allot of anime's you would anticipate whats gonna happen , let me correct you , you wont see it coming with every episode you will be surprised and stunned , like I was .

                                      (14/25 eps)","Honestly? I don't see why this anime is popular. (In fact, I disliked some of the elements so much that I came here to do something I said I wouldn't: become a big enough weeb to write a serious, deconstructed review for a fuckin' anime.) 

I've dropped the show after 14 episodes.

(reposting bc it got accidentally deleted! glad to see a lot of other top reviews share my opinion haha)

Story: 5/10
The story's decent, at least in the beginning. Time travel, fantasy lands, slapstick humor: nothing unusual, and all elements that've proven popular in other animes, but here, it seems to be a poorly executed jumble.
                  ...
From the surface, it looks cool- a regular joe dimension-jumps and finds himself in a world where, like in a videogame, he can die to return to the last checkpoint- but any deeper probing reveals what is, in my opinion, a goddamn boring shamble. It's disorganized in places, and plain dull in parts. There are some redeeming strokes, which are nice, but not, in my opinion, enough to pull up this anime into the 'must watch' region. (I might be biased against harem animes (and this one definitely has elements of a harem anime). I think they're dumb. Sorry.)

Art: 7/10
Nice art. I liked it. Nothing particularly special, but not off-putting, with good proportions and colors, and nice landscapes and worldbuilding. Probably one of the biggest redeeming points of this anime.

Music: 7/10
Same as the art- good music choices for the themes, well-fitting. Not distracting. Definitely helped set the mood for some scenes.

Character: 2/10
This is, in my opinion, where Re:Zero starts to go down the shithole.

The characters are boring as shit. The main character makes use of some slapstick humor tropes, like being comic relief and the hero at the same time- all it makes me think is that he's stupid as hell. Additionally, he becomes bizarrely obsessed with the main heroine over a very short amount of time, and this... devotion... becomes more and more drastic over the episodes, up to the point where he's directly disobeying her express wishes to do what he thinks is best- for her. (This was the biggest reason I dropped it. I fuckin' dislike the protag.) Finally, in a holy trinity of shit, he switches character types alarmingly often, from the charmingly obtuse but cheery character to the murderously entitled one to scared-to-the-point-of-shitting-his-pants. (I felt like he was a real gary sue, as happens a lot with harem animes. Dull as shit, but all the chicks end up falling in love with him anyways.)

Whew. Got that off my chest.

The rest of the characters- honestly, none of them really stood out. There are the basic character tropes- maid twins, tsunderes, the nice guy (though i have to say, out of all of them, Reinhard was probably my favorite), lolishotas, the perfectly bland girl, the eccentric master- and I found myself wondering when this episode was going to finally be over so I could see if the next one was any less boring. (Hint: It wasn't.)

Consensus: 3/10
I don't drop a lot of animes. Even moderately boring ones. Hell, I watched all 26 episodes of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and in terms of a ridiculous main character, that was even worse than this. Mostly, the thing that got me about Re:Zero was how goddamn annoying Subaru- the main- got after 5-6 episodes. Watch if you like good animation and music and interesting fight scenes, or are a fan of the trope fantasy genre, but if you're looking for genuinely dynamic, realistic character development- keep moving, nothing to see here."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"Hmmmm, what can I say about this anime. Well, for one I thoroughly enjoy it. Its been a while since an anime has really brought me in and kept me interested. I was on edge every second of the show. As I was someone who waited every week for the next episode to come out, the waiting felt like forever. I haven't read the manga, nor the light novel yet, but I intend to. By doing this it will show just how good of a job the studio did in trying to capture what the writer was trying to picture. 

What makes this show so
                  ...
good?!
- The story is always interesting, it is always enjoyable and never really draws you back
- The personalities of the characters are good, really makes you care for them. You may either love or hate the mc, based on some of the decisions he makes later on throughout the anime
- The artwork is very beautiful.
- The music is good and the intros are pretty catchy
- The series has pretty good comedy, but not so much you can't take the characters seriously, not much comedy towards the end of the series
- Has a pretty solid ending, but there are a few answers left unanswered, but you have to watch it to figure out what those answers are and I won't spoil anything for you.

I understand that not everyone is going to love this show as much as I do. But seriously give this anime a chance. I'm sure somewhere it'll catch your attention. There's nothing wrong with disliking this anime, it may not be your cup of tea. 

I recommend this anime to anyone, unless you aren't a big fan of gore, as it can get pretty gorey at certain points throughout the anime!"

                                      (15/25 eps)","Re:Zero is the currently airing anime that many people are watching right now. It begins with an otaku, Subaru Natsuki,  who is transported to another world where whenever he dies, he comes back to life again from an earlier point in time, being able to correct his mistakes. 

Many people seem to enjoy this show, but I feel this show isn't really that great. Although it is not finished yet, I have read some spoilers about what will happen next and I believe around the 15 episode mark is a good place to make a judgment upon a series. Even though I am in
                  ...
the minority about this not being a great show, I still want to offer my opinion on the show in case it helps anyone out. 

[Disclaimer: There are spoilers about the series below. Read at your own discretion.]

Story: 4/10

I feel like this anime, so far, really has no end goal in mind. It really is just Subaru trying to find a way to survive. With a lack of focus on any sort of plot, I have no idea what kind of ending this series is supposed to have. If we go each arc at a time, I find that first arc is pretty decent. While it has its flaws, I can still find some enjoyment in it. In this arc, Subaru is introduced  Emilia and has to find her pin that she lost. Using his past experiences as a guide, he is able retrieve it. This arc serves as a decent introductory arc to what the series can be, but it is lost potential from there. The second arc is totally useless and provides almost nothing to the main story. The only bit of story is from the first episode of the arc. Other than that, it totally deviates from the main story and can easily be skipped without missing out on anything. The characters introduced here are forgettable and so bland, you don’t even need their introductions to know them well enough, but I’ll go into more deeper in the character section. With the second arc, we can begin to see the Subaru break down as a character, as he becomes more obsessed and broken. I was forcing myself to watch this second arc, but the lack of focus this has on anything made it a major chore on me. The third arc started okay, but delved deeper into meaningless and boring territory, with what I think, no way out. We learn about the priestess selection ceremony and how Emilia is part of it. But as we go further into the arc, it delves away from this and instead goes into another meaningless arc with Subaru’s action being really cringe-worthy and eventually is just Subaru wanting to return to Emilia’s mansion, with no focus on the storytelling anywhere else to help deepen the plot and world. 

Characters: 2/10

The characters beside Subaru in Re:Zero are bland and have very little personality. They are not interesting and have generic backstories. I do not feel attached to any of the characters at all because we, as viewers, aren't given any reason to do so. For example, the maids Ram and Rem are introduced and we learn they are demons. Their backstory is not compelling and is essentially the writer trying to force emotions onto us when it is working due to the genericness and the way it is presented to the viewers. As for their personalities, they don’t really any. They are just maids and do maid tasks to varying degrees of success. There is nothing interest about that at all. Theses characters are truly forgettable. As for the main protagonist of Sabaru, although he does have some semblance of personality, the way he acts and behaves makes me exasperated at him and the show. Firstly, he does not even question how or why is transported into this world. Instead, he acts like it is completely normal and is surprisingly chill about it. He does not even contemplate about his past life and the things he has lost, like his family and friends. Over the course of the series, Subaru begins to acts more irrationally and puts emotion over logic, which greatly affects him both physically and mentally. Although experiencing death is taxing to an extent; the way Subaru lets his emotions control time and time again leads him to make stupid decisions which ultimately leads to a preventable death and therefore less stress off him. Subaru’s main motivation to is for a girl he met, Emilia. Over the course of the show, Subaru obsesses over her constantly, without being given an actual reason to, besides the fact he finds her hot. His actions are a main reason that this show really is off-putting, since a rational person would not act like he does. Character death is supposed to be used to draw emotions from the viewer; but instead, Re:zero uses it as a plot convenience instead of its intended purpose. This is because Subaru can alway die to prevent his own and other’s deaths. And although an element was added in a recent episode that worked around this flaw, I find it to be stupid due to it seeming to be going nowhere. 

Art: 7/10

For an anime to come in 2016, the animation is fair. It isn't great, but it isn't bad either. The animation is fluid and the colors are nice to look. Overall, it's pretty decent. The character designs seem really generic and I don't really feel any uniqueness from them.

Sound: 5/10

None of the tracks are memorable, but they aren't bad. They are just there. The opening nor the ending really stands to me. The voice actors are pretty good and they portray the characters well while delivering enough emotion where it isn't too much or little. Overall, the sound is just mediocre, there is nothing special to it.

Enjoyment: 2/10

I really forced myself to watch this show because of the large amount of people saying it was worth my time. While watching, I was forcing myself to try and find the good parts of the show, but they were few. The characters, plot and world were all bland and boring. I did not enjoy how the story did not expand to anything more than Subaru doing a small task, while the bland and tasteless side characters made this show more of a chore. The animation and sound did not help my enjoyment of the show at all. 

Overall: 3/10

Overall, RE:Zero could have been much better, if it decided to flesh out many elements and put more effort into building an actual story. With this and better characters, this show would have a lot better and I would have enjoyed even more. Unfortunately, this show fails in these aspects and does not live up to the hype it has built for me personally. This is why I am giving RE:Zero a score of 3.4/10."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"Imagine getting suddenly thrown into a fantasy world. Would you be:
A) shocked about the whole thing and desperately trying to survive and then find a way home, 
or
B) cheerfully helping random girls and running into mortal danger like an action hero without any care?

If you answered B), then congrats, you just might be the protagonist of Re: Zero. Who would act like that, really? No actual human being. As a result, this guy is impossible to relate to. Whenever they try to make him seem more human, he always quickly reverts to his waifu-chasing heroics. Just listen to him:
""One good deed a day.""
""My main heroine
                  ...
is an easy woman, huh!?""
""Men are about guts, and women are about beauty!""
""You get a front row seat to see the man you fell for become the most awesome hero ever!""

This is the kind of dialogue where faces and palms meet.

Re: Zero is a show where we have our ""I must save everyone; girls are cute and men are heroes"" protagonist facing off against the ""Mwahaha, I'm so crazy and psychotic and I like murdering people"" villains or, even worse, random unintelligent monsters. Black and white to the point of tedium. It's all meaningless, really. Whenever there are signs of moral ambiguity in the supporting cast, we are quickly convinced that they are good people at heart after all. We might get interesting characters then and we can't have that.

The author must have noticed how stale the script is, so he tried to wash it away with blood. And they failed. Re: Zero demonstrates that overflowing gore and surreal horror don't by themselves constitute interesting moral conflict. Yes, arms will fly off and heads will roll on a whim. Yes, there are otherwordly monsters and esoteric vistas with piles of corpses. This is all fine if you like bloodbath or surreal horror for the sake of itself, but if you are looking for meaningful moral struggle, the show can't deliver at all. I don't want to watch ten minutes of some bland douchebag ranting about how insane he is or how much he likes murdering people. And I certainly don't want to watch two episodes of fighting against a generic RPG monster.

Meet Natsuki Subaru, alleged NEET and shutin (never demonstrated onscreen) and also a blank slate with no past or original thoughts to speak of. He has no wit, no charm, no decent lines. A large chunk of his screentime is spent delivering boring cliches about girls, dating and alleged feminine virtues. Now and then the show tries to be self-aware and lets him lampshade some tropes, but he only does it for the really obvious and boring ones.
""Read between the lines a bit, will you!? It was supposed to be a classic scenario where I save a girl from hoodlums!""

So anyway, he is cast into a fantasy world and for some reason gets time travel powers, getting stuck into a time loop every time he dies. Which happens all the time because the whole world is out to get him and this guy has no sense of self-preservation in the first place. For him chasing girls takes precedence over finding a way home, discovery about this new world and even simple survival. In mortal danger he spends his time planning dates (or how to harass the girls, rather). Indeed, much of the show consists of the protagonist getting murdered in increasingly brutal and strange ways. 

What is really disappointing about the time travel is how much he has to rely not on smarts but action hero stunts, which he is somehow able to pull off, apparently because he works out sometimes. Seems legit. There are a few good moments here and there of Subaru getting more and more insane because of the time loops and the responses it draws from the other characters. It is then that he comes across as slightly human, but he'll go back to his heroics soon enough. How many times do we have to listen to cheesy speeches about bravery and selfless sacrifice? He even wants to save people who have tried to kill him. How much of a goody two shoes is this guy?

The show has him ""reform"" himself every few episodes, by which I don't mean he is questioning his motives or values in any substantial way. No, what happens is that he reconfirms his purpose in life, which is saving his waifus, and comes up with a better plan to get it done. Again. Well, at least he hasn't done his stupid poses with shaking his hips anymore, so there's that.

It's not like it would have been hard to come up with better goals for this guy. He could be an anti-hero or villain protagonist trying to get more fame and fortune for himself. Or how about improving local society and social conditions? The place sure would need it. But alas, in this show politics is little more than a plot device that occupies a few minutes. It's kind of silly, actually: politics would have offered countless excuses for war, riots and other potential massacres to satisfy the bloodthirsty viewers. But we can't have real social commentary; that would get in the way of joke-like villains and waifus.

The rest of the cast isn't much better. The main love interest Emilia is barely in the show, mostly standing in the background or more often offscreen. You'd think that a romance would require more, you know, interaction between the two characters. Her main personality trait is helping people in need. How original. There is also a collection of other waifus with awkward dialogue, usually involving Subaru harassing them in various ways. A few of the side characters have more interesting personalities, but out of them it is the boring ones who get the most screentime. We even get lengthy flashbacks of one guy's past when he was never interesting to begin with. Thanks.

There is also poor pacing. Too often, the episode consists of 20 minutes of filler and hanging out with waifus and 2 minutes of pointless gore and cliffhangers. Occasionally we get a full episode of pointless gore instead, but it isn't much of an improvement. Especially episodes 4 through 11 are very slow at moving the overall plot forward. There is some mystery surrounding Emilia, but in 25 episodes it got so little focus it might as well have not been there. Surely there would have been time to develop it if they had cut down some of the pointless fight scenes or hanging out with secondary waifus. You had 25 episodes, there's no excuse. Get on with it!

No amount of blood will wash away bad writing, and Re: Zero is proof of that."

[Story: ]
The events were boring. There was no buildup to anything and all that seemed to happen in the show was a psychopath or beast killed the protagonist and his friends over and over, and the protagonist tried to stop them from dying. I think in the entire show the only buildup to an event or murder was that the murderer or beast was mentioned in a passing conversation. Like ""hey watch out for that whale, it's bad news"" was it and *poof* there's the
                  ...
whale.

The setting was a boring anime fantasy.. There were no cool powers, no interesting villains, no realistic depictions of economy, war, or politics. It's baffling how anyone makes a fantasy setting boring and generic given the potential to do anything with it, but Re:Zero somehow accomplished me being bored in a fantasy setting, which is exceedingly rare.

The writing was pretty bad. The series continually killed off characters, only to say ""not really"" to the audience over and over. The only tension was of the protagonist mental state since everyone in the show was effectively immortal, regardless of how much the protagonist cried over each of their deaths, even after the 4th time it happened.  Then there is the fact that no one the show seems to have any real motivation outside of undying servitude to a princess or evil witch.

[Art/animation]
Mediocre animation. A couple of animation cheats such as reused animation or repetitive jump cuts, but for the most part it's simply ""passable."" Not much to say outside of ""nothing interesting/new to see here.""

[Sound]
Mediocre soundtrack that was used extremely poorly.  Re:Zero tries to baby the audience by putting a ""whoo-wee-whoo"" at every sign of something bad, often in a much too obvious manner. The soundtrack itself is forgettable fantasy anime soundtrack #76, but it was also played extremely low in the background throughout the anime, making a lot of scenes almost dead quite with the exception of a few twangs every now and then.

[Characters]
Subaru is a polarizing mess. He's poorly written, has inconsistent mood swings and changes of character, and is generally an idiot about everything to an unrealistic degree. His backstory is completely forgotten by episode one and there seems to be no real reason to make him from an alternate dimension outside of Japanese otaku self-inserting themselves into him.

Emilia is basically non-existent for over half of the anime, despite being a major focus of Subaru's actions and motivations. If you want to note something about her note how little of a connection she and Subaru have and how big it is played out.

Rem is the ""too good for this world"" character who develops so fast from her original ""shy but psycho"" personality that it's almost as if the author replaced her with a clone halfway through.

Wilhelm is probably the only character within the show I view as being good. He has a consistent backstory and motivation for his actions. Sadly he's sidelined and his entire existence is merely defined as a side-character by his position alone.

The rest are forgettable archetypes. Loli's, tsunderes, white-knights, traps, the whole shibang you see in almost every fantasy series.

[Final thoughts]

Re:Zero remains to me what is a growing problem with the industry, that anime are put out in mediocre condition with no desire to go anywhere or do anything but be another fantasy anime among hundreds. Sure, it got hype and success because of calculated marketing decisions regarding characters, but I'm sure it's not going to stand the test of time.

I'm sure that I'll look back on this series and rate it lower thanks to it's terribly low rewatchability due to it's reliance on shockfactor/plot-twist/edge, but for now it's a solid 3/10.

It's not the worse anime ever produced, it's not terrible. But it's certainly got a lot more fundamental problems than other anime have."

Re:Zero is a fantastic adventure fantasy thriller that got me hooked right from episode 0, you don't know what the fuck is going on but you watch it anyway cause it's interesting, every episode is just so unpredictable and mind blowing that even if you find a huge flaw, it really wouldn't ruin your enjoyment. The main highlight of this show are it's dark elements, sometimes it's just so brutal and fucked up the adrenaline rush is just...gawd.
Character development is really good too, especially the MC, the writer does not hold back against him. he is hit hard, again and again, which slowly, harsh and brutally develops him throughout the series. 
The art and animation is really good, as expected from white fox studios. the music is some next level shit tho, I can't describe how well it goes with scenes, it's brilliant direction i suppose. There are also these 2 second voice soundtracks in between that deserve a mention. that are so creepy and freak me out every fucking time, because i always watch this around midnight, I probably get more freaked out than i should lol but nonetheless it fits the scene so perfectly, giving you the chills. OPs and EDs are very good too, the 2nd ED being one of my most favorites this year.
Although this show is much praiseworthy, it does not come without it's flaws. sometimes it's just annoying and turns into a big cringefest, and although it tries to be original, which it does for the most part. it can sometimes come off as cliché. dropping into a fantasy world, recurring time loop and there are small things here and there that you probably would have seen before. but there is one major thing i really have to criticize about the writing, that is Subaru's lack of backstory. he just falls into fantasy realm and doesn't give a two shit flying fuck about where he came from. Don't you have anyone back home? anyone who cares for you back there at all? idk if the writers would address this in the future but i can only judge so far from what's there. 
But anyway, Re:Zero for what it is, it's an absolute must watch. A series I highly recommend for it's unpredictability and a thrilling experience like no other! with that being said, i would give my final rating-
8.75/10"

STORY

Okay let me start of by saying that this is probably gonna be a crappy review but here we go.....

Story is the typical, Protagonist get's sent to Fantasy world and whatnot. Thinks they have powers once they get there but they don't. Subaru kind of has power but can't really control it unless he dies. I felt like it was one of those good Fantasy genres and enjoyed it a lot.

Character's were good. I felt like they had good development and with his power's making his relationships with the people around him better. Obviously there those characters you can't stand but that happens.

ENJOYMENT

Now this is the part I was waiting to type. My Enjoyment was 11/10 because I couldn't wait to see the new episode every week. They made cliffhangers that made you wanna keep watching and I love stuff like that.

I was highly skeptical when I first started watching Re: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu since I was under the misconception that it was another one those animes with eye-catching visual presentation (mainly the anime cover) and generic fantasy premise, struggling to separate itself from similar shows that make use of the weary “transported into another world” concept by aiming to be a lighthearted fantasy story mixed with gore, death and dark psychological elements. 

I honestly thought I was going to dislike this show despite the original creator’s, Tappei Nagatsuki, intention to showcase time travel in a
                  ...
way that could easily be associated with checkpoints or save points in videogames: A magical ability that allows you to go back in time to visited locations and (most likely) at the very start of experienced events. You might be asking, “What’s the catch?”. 

Well, all you need to do is die a painful death before it can be triggered. It sounded like the perfect recipe for exhausting repetitiveness, especially after I learned a little bit about the kind of character that obtains this ability. That’s not all.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that every character would exhibit a wide range of stereotypes (one per character) that reinforces their external appearances and vice versa without any small hints of uniqueness to their personalities. 

For example, the main character is a hikikomori, modern otaku poisoned by anime and games that is portrayed as a hot-headed, zany, rash and powerless young man. One day, out of nowhere, this anonymous young hero embarks on an epic journey in another realm.  

He wears a tracksuit and has “sanpaku eyes”. The guy becomes the target of affection from many of the girls in the fantasy world he has been transported to, without developing meaningful relationships with them first. 

He builds a harem that consists of cliché, boring and uninspired females such as mary sues’, tsunderes, lolis’s and so on, becomes super powerful somehow, makes friends, overcomes any obstacle he encounters, defeats the main antagonist all by himself and successfully wins the heart of the main heroine. 

In other words, he could be best described as the typical shounen hero and the plot is basically about how he lives the ideal life in a fictitious world that many of us dreams of having.  

It doesn’t sound like the most unorthodox characterization and story, does it? However, after completing this fantastic anime with abundant originality and suspenseful moments, allow me to elaborate more on my reasons for giving Re: Zero a score of 10/10 overall. 

If you keep reading this review, you’ll understand that everything I’ve said about the protagonist, female characters and plot in the example I just provided is NOT entirely true. I’m gonna try to keep it short. 

Plot: 9/10

The show starts with our main character Natsuki Subaru who is instantaneously transported without warning to a parallel fantasy world while he was on his way back home from the convenience store. Being the massive sucker for anime and games that he is, our effervescent and hopeful Subaru contemplates out loud the various possibilities of finding himself in an unknown world that looks and feels like playing an RPG or MMORPG game. 

After a while, Subaru is quickly disappointed upon realizing that he doesn’t have any special powers or abilities fitting for him according to the “main hero that has been summoned to another world by the main heroine” pattern or whatever. *rolls eyes* 

His unflagging “meta” prattling and wandering are both temporarily halted by a somewhat unforeseen encounter with 3 threatening-looking thugs in an alleyway, attempting to make him yield to their intimidating demands. 

Surprisingly, despite being a shut-in NEET, Subaru displays (to a certain degree) physical prowess and hand-to-hand combat knowledge earned from his workout routines and manages to overwhelm the group of thugs…

That is until he shifts from “I’ll mow these guys down and make them fuel for my shining future” to a pathetic, lily-livered person who prostrates and begs for forgiveness after noticing one of the 3 thugs wielding a glinting knife. 

Our protagonist gets beaten to a pulp but, luckily for him, it doesn’t take long before a small girl thief with longish blond hair named Felt dashes past them since she is being chased by the mysterious, beautiful silver- haired half elf and spirit arts user “main heroine” Emilia (although she initially goes by the name Satella). It turns out, Felt stole Emilia’s insignia and she desires to get it back no matter what it takes. 

After interrogating the thugs and Subaru himself, she refuses to let the thugs continue with their act of injustice and decides to save Subaru from his wretched situation with the assistance of her cute artificial cat spirit Puck/Pack (I prefer the name Puck…you know, like Puck from Berserk ^_^). 

The thugs were forced to retreat but Emilia and Puck stayed to heal Subaru’s wounds under Emilia’s pretext “I still have some questions to ask you otherwise I would’ve left you behind” instead of resuming her search without a second thought. 

Subaru wishes to return the favor by offering his services for the sake of retrieving her stolen insignia and later at night, they locate its whereabouts: a loot cellar in the slums of the capital city of the Kingdom of Lugunica (the country where Subaru and Emilia are). 

Once inside the loot cellar, Subaru discovers the dismembered dead body of old man Rom, the master of the loot cellar. Emilia, concerned about how Subaru is doing, enters the loot cellar and follows the same fate as him. 

Their lives come to an end but Subaru immediately reawakens in the middle of a familiar event he has already experienced. What’s more puzzling for Subaru is how he ends up experiencing other events that leave him with feelings of déjà vu but with significant differences to his first “dream” or “illusion”.   

Skipping forward, Subaru is finally able to fully understand what is going on…okay, actually, it took him dying 3 TIMES in total before he was able to fully understand what was going on (What an idiot but he is not mentally retarded, meaning he could get smarter ;3). 

It turns out that he does possess a magical ability which he decides to call “Return by Death”, a power that activates every time Subaru dies. It enables him to reverse time back to a randomly selected checkpoint, relive that segment of his life in order to change it to a future where he successfully accomplishes one or many objectives without dying and move on. 

In my intro, I expressed my fear about potentially disliking Re: Zero because of Subaru and his “Return by Death”. The first story arc (episodes 1-3) made me think how this anime could turn into a boring and repetitive run-of-the-mill experience in future arcs since our main character is constantly failing and traveling back in time to relive the exact same scenarios repeatedly. 

Nevertheless, the plot proceeds onwards without showing any indication that it would slowly transformed into a “f****** waste of time” thanks to Subaru picking up little by little new pieces of information that were previously unknown to him and try figuring out the best course of action in each complication he runs into. 

Throughout almost the entire anime, he is unable to come up with well-contrived solutions but his improvisations and support from powerful allies never failed to impress me. 

This direction delivered diversity and excitement. It made everything less predictable too. Soon enough, I was mesmerized by the story and couldn’t resist the urge of wanting to know what was gonna happen next by the end of each episode. 

That’s another thing this anime was good at: Cliffhangers that will fuel your desire to marathon the whole thing in one sitting. 

Sure, I’ll admit that this show left a lot of unexplored plot points and unanswered questions such as the royal selection, Subaru’s strong spirit affinity and Yin magic, the identity of the pale gold-haired maid in the flashback of episode 11, the connection between Subaru and the Witch of Envy known as Satella, the reason for “summoning” Subaru and the one behind it, Roswaal’s motive for wanting to kill the dragon, etc. 

Plus, due to time constrains, the director Masaharu Watanabe and everyone else involved in Re: Zero’s production decided that it would be best to skip and alter some scenes from the web novel/light novel like Roswaal telling Rem to not stop Subaru in case he decided to go to the castle located in the capital city where the royal selection would take place, Al’s background or Subaru trying to kill Crusch with a spoon after she refuses to aid him in killing the Witch’s Cult and replace it with him just walking up to her menacingly, only to be stopped by Wilhelm in episode 16. 

Regardless, these factors never became detriments for the evolution of the story since there was a decent number of mysteries and other questions that were prioritized and added more complexity. The pacing was okay for the most part but every time it was increased, that’s when s*** got real. 

Anyways, it is undeniable that this anime adaptation of Re: Zero did a good job at telling a thought-provoking story despite its small lack of loyalty to the original source material. I guess we should be thankful that they didn’t “100% faithfully” crammed 9 light novel volumes worth of content in 25 anime episodes. 

Otherwise, this show would be the equivalent of having a buffalo taking a diarrhea dump in your ear right now (yes, that was an AVGN reference ;D). Believe me, it was for the best.  

Characters: 9/10 

From the very beginning until the bitter end, Subaru is the kind of MC you will grow to dislike, like or both simultaneously depending on how you view his journey and development. 

He is not some overpowered protagonist who can inexplicably beat anyone. You could describe him as your average Joe or comic relief type of character but that’s hardly scratching the surface. Despite acting like a rambunctious little brat who likes to babble and giving the impression that he might have the intelligence of a brick in a few occasions, there is more to him than meets the eye. 

Subaru is actually a very sensitive, flawed and vulnerable character who has spend his life (back in the country of Japan) taking the easiest route in every tough or bothersome situation and secluding himself in his room to play video games, read mangas or watch animes.He is a teenager who became a modern otaku in order to escape the realities of his life back in Japan but once he realized that the fantasy world he has been transported to wasn’t the ultimate dream of escapism come true, Subaru had no other choice than to see things as they were rather than thinking something like “at the end of the day, this is just a game”. 

His meeting with Emilia and others as well as his “Return by Death” ability set in motion a chain of events that taught him in the most brutal and unforgiving fashion the importance of being hard-working. Plus, it drastically changed how he saw the concepts of pity and compassion. This was likely because he mostly interacted with people in the virtual world. He acted uncaring towards others due to his desire of avoiding getting too emotional by making fun of them. He used to think of it as troublesome. After all, he wanted to live a life full of convenience and enjoyment. 

His antics are both his best attempts at being friendly with others and his self-preservation mechanism. Logically, like every normal human being, he has his mental and emotional limitations. Now that he had to deal with these heavy issues in real life, Subaru started to understand that there was a whole different level of weight to them. No matter where he was, the universe wasn’t going to conspire in his favor. If he wanted something, he needed to work hard to get it. If he truly wanted to make close friends, he needed to start being more honest with himself and the ones who moved his heart.   

He is not going to win any awards with his intellect, yes, but after seeing him memorizing small but helpful details from previous timelines during the first 3 episodes such as Lugunica having their own organization that functioned like a police force in the form of the Kingdom Knights and using that fact against the group of thugs in episode 2 or Puck’s “working hours” and using that to quickly instruct him to defend Emilia from Elsa’s attack in episode 3, I thought there was no f****** way he didn’t have the potential to come up with carefully calculated plans in the future. 

He doesn’t always win on his own merits but like I said before: his improvisations and support from powerful allies never failed to impress me (well, now that I think about it, having good luck was required in some cases too). I honestly don’t understand why there are many people who think that he seemingly goes from being an idiot to a shrewd person in less than a blink of an eye, without any logical explanation or proper buildup. 

He is basically stuck in-between the two. Later on, he leans toward being smarter and less stupid. That’s all there is to it. He tries to remain positive by being silly while persevering against extreme hardships and protecting the people he has come to care about. 

This includes Emilia who he putted on a pedestal since he initially saw her as his savior and bewitching lady, the central pillar that sustained his deluded world where he was the hero fated to carry out her bidding. The kind and lovable “main heroine” he would end up together with, no matter what he did or said. 

At first, I thought he wasn’t serious and was just messing around with the whole “I’m the main character of this fantasy world and Emilia’s knight” due to his “Return by Death” and achievements in arcs 1 (episodes 1-3) and 2 (episodes 4-11). Nonetheless, between episodes 13-18, Subaru slowly falls into despair and insanity. 

He betrays Emilia’s trust and instead of patching things up with Emilia by telling her that everything he has done was for her sake and that she owed a great debt to him, Emilia distances herself from Subaru since she was no longer capable of understanding and trusting him. 

His deluded world intensifies even further to the point where he completely ignores what the other royal candidates (Priscilla, Crusch and Anastasia) expect from him in exchange for their help to save Emilia from the Witch’s Cult in Roswaal’s domain. As a result, they degraded Subaru and with no one else he could depend on, he heads back to the Roswaal mansion and Arlam village with the lovely demon maid Rem…only for him to despair even further. 

The anime didn’t depict anything about his past but during his self-loathing rant in episode 18 (one of the best episodes I’ve ever seen in my existence thus far) we hear him say stuff about how he had wasted his life up to that point. He never did anything productive with his freedom. His powerlessness and incompetence resulted in his “rotten” character, according to him. 

However, he decides to “start over from zero” (Rem said it to him first and he pondered her words until he conceded) thanks to Rem’s emotional support and her love confession to him. Plus, she shared with Subaru her vision of their future IF they had left everything behind by running away together (man, such a great prolonged scene ^_^). 

His newfound resolve to become a “real” hero and go through with it, made me feel satisfied enough to forgive him for turning Rem down. He never stopped loving Emilia and Rem accepted his feelings. On the other hand, he did stopped thinking about how unfair it was that Emilia didn’t love him the same way he did.

In episodes 19-25, Subaru shows signs of maturing by being less selfish and more considerate toward people like when he acknowledged that the inhabitants of Arlam village had their own opinions that differed from his own or Julius’s apology. He even took responsability for his past actions and what he said by apologizing sincerely to Emilia and Julius (although, he still subconsciously resents him). He redeemed himself in more ways than one.     

He might not be one of the best MCs ever but he was awesome for all the right reasons. Oh yeah, I almost forgot: He DOESN’T build a harem and I don’t think Nagatsuki-sensei wants him to build one either.          

Rem’s background, character development and relationship progress with Subaru were delightful to watch. Now, I could easy write about her just as much as I did with Subaru but I’ll refrain from doing so. The reason is because I’m still trying to make this review as short as possible. >_< 

The first few times we see her, she humorously makes fun of Subaru along with her twin sister Ram. She respects her sister to the point of worship and holds guilt toward her due to an incident in the past. Because of it, she used to think of herself as inferior. She falls deeply in love with Subaru and becomes one of his most loyal followers after he saves and teaches her about self-worth. 

Rem definitely went beyond the obsessed yandere archetype we are so accustomed to in other animes. Otherwise, why didn’t she fall for Subaru without any effort on his part?. Why did she accept that Subaru’s heart belonged to Emilia?. Feel free to disagree with me. Regardless, she was a great character just like Subaru.

Emilia’s character was good too. Unlike Subaru and Rem, she didn’t get the same treatment in terms of character development but at least we were given more info about how she thinks of herself in the last episode. That sounds like a good starting point, right?. 

After she was introduced, I immediately thought she was going to follow the tsundere archetype to the letter. I was wrong. She was something between a tsundere and dandere although that’s still not good enough to describe her personality. 

She is good natured, independent, likes to take care of others though she refuses to admit it, she sometimes acts like a child and she is discriminated against because she looks like the Witch of Envy.

I didn’t have any major problems with her, except that she hardly gets any screen time in the second half of the anime. Wilhelm was a badass character. I loved his background and interactions with Subaru.

In general, the rest of the supporting cast was strong and likable. Their backgrounds remained a mystery but their personality traits were special even if they weren’t fully fleshed-out characters. 

They each served more than one purpose in the story which kept them from being boring and one-dimensional. Lastly, I think it would have helped if they had reduced the amount of supporting characters.

Art: 9/10

I only had two complains. The first one is that the animation dipped in quality more than once after a while in fight scenes or dialogue scenes and the second one is the use of CGI in background characters (maybe CGI was used in some other stuff). 

I liked everything else. The character designs, the vibrant colors, the detailed facial expressions and features during moments when the character’s faces were zoomed in on, etc. 

Sound: 9.5/10

I thought the opening themes were ok. The ending themes were great. My favorite was the first ending called Styx Helix by Myth & Roid. The soundtrack done by Kenichiro Suehiro was outstanding and the Seiyuus/Seiyus were all fabulous. 

Entertainment: 10/10

Do I really need to explain myself? Re: Zero was fun, sad, it kept me on the edge of my seat and so on. This anime was as entertaining as it could possibly get.   

Overall: 9.6/10

I believe Re: Zero is the best anime of 2016. If you don’t think so, that’s totally fine. This show was well executed and unique. It was deep and memorable. It was a refreshing take on the overused “transported into another world” concept. 

It wasn’t perfect but then again nothing in this world is perfect and besides, the story is far from over. That is why I’m going to give extra support to Re: Zero by rising my overall score, buying the light novels and keeping my fingers crossed for a second season. Thank you for your time and have a great day! ;D"

“Deus Ex Machina” defines as a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and unlikely occurrence. Its function to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a happy ending. This is a plot device used as an emergency escape button when a story is impossible to finish without any sort of divine intervention. “Deus Ex Machina” is the term that summarizes what Re: Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu or Re: Zero for short is all about. Re: Zero provided “what if scenarios”
                  ...
that are both interesting and entertaining. It can show the 2 sides of the coin by presenting an unforgiving story and a positive alternative that satisfies its audience. Re: Zero's story can be rewritten how the author sees fits. But is this enough for the show considered good and excusable for the negation of its consequences? Let’s find out.

Art (8/10) & Sound (7/10)

When it comes to production values and aesthetics quality Re: Zero deserves a pass. The visual design and color selection is well place for the art style. The character design is eye-catchy and easy to recognize. The action scenes are very good. It doesn’t felt cheap. The animation is fluent when it comes to quick motion movement.  Thought the background setting is not unique and seems generic at times. And my last complaint is the selection of CGI pedestrian and CGI Dragons. It felt out of frame with your 2D character models. It looks creepy seeing both animations in the same place. But there are times the CGI looks great when it comes to fighting giant monsters. It gives an eerie atmosphere in the battles that felt unique and epic. When it comes to appealing presentation. Re: Zero combines good audio music and artistic creativity in presenting all OP and ED”s songs. The music add-up with the interpretation of the show. OP 1 Redo"" by Konomi Suzuki gave an interesting presentation of the initial episodes, it gives the audience suspense and excitement, the feeling of what do you think will happen next? Sort of intensity. OP 2 ""Paradisus-Paradoxum"" by MYTH & ROID by far the best opening of Re: Zero. It raises the bar by showing some extreme escalation of the conflict. Its presentation of a coming epic battle intrigues me to keep on watching. ED 1 ""STYX HELIX"" by MYTH & ROID however unique in all the music. I like the Vocaloid type of vibes on for its bizarre music rhythm. It also functions as a good ED for RE: Zero for the music itself felt like a mystery. RE: ZERO was focus on mystery-solving before it becomes a heavy action show so it definitely fits in. The least music is ""Stay Alive"" by Emilia. The music is good but it feels like a stand-alone. I know the music dedicates to Emilia's innocent and hopes for a better future but the problem is the timing of the music when it was released. Emilia is not the center of the arc when it plays so it comes out as out of place. The music did good timing in other specific episodes that share the same idea of light and hope. Overall my favorite music is ""STYX HELIX"" by MYTH & ROID for being different while the other music still deserves a place in my playlist.

Plot (6/10)

Re: Zero revolves around Natsuki, Subaru, Your Typical Modern Day Japanese Male Teenager. He's the main protagonist of the show. He was transported in a fantasy realm with no clear reason whatsoever. The majority of the story takes place from Subaru's's viewpoints. As he struggles to know the truth, on why he was been summoned in the first place. Suburu eventually got his life in an awful predicament but was saved by Emilia, a silvered-hair half-elf human with magical powers. After that faithful encounter, Subaru decided to help Emilia out in any way possible, in payment of the compassion and kindness she showed to him. This kick-started Re: Zero main plot in motion. But unfortunately, Suburu died while helping Emilia out, ending the story. This leaves some unanswered questions and mystery in the story. Though this is not the case. The story restarted back to a certain point in time, where Subaru is still alive, with all his memories intact. He then discovers that he has the ability to reset time back to a starting point whenever he died.

Subaru takes advantage of this ability by taking precautionary measures to fix his past mistakes and planning ahead of time. Thus achieving desirable outcomes. Time resets provide interesting scenarios and character engagement. We can see different interactions; we get to know the other characters better. We learn more about the setting and the gravity of the situation.

But this type of storytelling is not without any flaws. Time resets have the capability to nullify any negative consequences of a story. It deletes permanent changes otherwise irreversible in normal means. It gives some restrain when it comes to developing its characters. It cancels out any progress and character growth. If the said interaction and action yield undesirable consequences, it cannot exist. To be precise, it negates the show's risk and tension. 

The biggest offense most likely a time reset can do is overwriting its character's role. Or worst changing your character's personality to a different person entirely. It can be by times a good thing and for the better but sometimes it makes your characters irrelevant. Characters can become an empty husk that can be rewritten, depending on the need of the story. 

Even though the problems I stated have indeed existed. The story still follows a linear path. Suggesting only one true and final destination the narrative is leading to. And the protagonist needs to find out the best way to reach that said route. Re: Zero narrative works like in a video game type of storytelling. Usually, this type of narrative is common in visual novels. At the start of the game, you have a choice to make a decision that will affect the outcome of the story later on. The consequences can either stop the main story on its tracks or continue forward to the true ending. 

Subaru function as the player, every action he takes, any changes in a decision he makes affects the story. Suburu is the God of his story for not only he can change faith once, but he can do it again many times. The story only provided some vague information about Subaru time reset restriction. There isn’t any solid cost and consequences. Only Subaru's ever-growing guilt and fear of death are considered a consequence. Though some fears and guilt can be negated once he achieves the ultimate satisfaction, his main goal making everybody happy. Said resets can function as a convenience for the author. He can choose which events are the real canon story, whatever favors the story. This saddens me for Re: Zero can be any story it wanted to be. It can become a tragedy, it can become heavy action-adventure and it can also become a warm slice of life in a medieval setting. This all happens in RE: Zero in a short amount of time by spamming different timelines. Because Suburu decision is the only thing that matters in the direction of the story and nothing else. The show doesn’t need to bother with consistency anymore. What is consistent will be changed on the next reset, having new a set of elements and scenarios.

This type of storytelling becomes troublesome. When it comes to opposing conflict. Whatever advance and careful planning the opposition has. Any surprise attack or strategies that involves the passage of time. All the opponent's tactics are useless. Once Suburu discovers the grand scheme of things. They are all left baffled. Confuse on the discovery of their plans. Disbelief that all their hard work and timely plans got sabotage too fast. Suburu might have as well the ultimate weapon, for time is on his side. This sums0 up how Re: Zero resolves its ongoing conflict. Any villains might as well cower in fear that they have nothing to counter Suburu. Suburu has King Crimson like abilities. Having the ability to see the future and change faith itself.


Character (6/10) 

There are indeed interesting and memorable characters in the series. Some characters do get their fair share in the story, while some are left forgotten when the new arc arrives. In the worst-case scenario, some characters experience some undesirable regression. Due to Subaru's time reset ability and changes in the plot direction. 

The character that holds a significant role in the story changes in every arc. They also never got explored later on. They are just there for convenience's sake for the main character in a certain scenario. Like when Reinhard van Astrea introduction. He was only there to end the conflict in the first arc and we didn’t have the chance to know him better even in later arcs.

While some characters like Beatrice function as information dump only, for Subaru to learn from and help come out with a solution. Eventually, after all the problems are resolved. Beatrice and other relevant characters in a certain arc are put back in the corner and forgotten in favor of another arc. Even the characters I actually like suffers the same cycle. One of those characters is Sir Wilhelm. He actually had a solid back story that justifies his motivation. It gives a personal conflict in the current events, in return gives you a reason to invest in the story. Sadly after his story arc concluded, Wilhelm's role was reduced to an old man that is a badass with the sword. Characters really come and go in this series. The first time you know them and the next they are long gone. I felt like the story is treating its characters like equipment than people. Equipment that is put-away in the toolbox after their utilities are met in the story. Leaving has back to Suburu antics again.

It would be nice if the show bothers to explore more side character's viewpoints. Instead of relying on Suburu adventures to understand what's happening. Until now I don't see Re: Zero setting engaging or unique to other Isekai anime. Some lore and basic information are there. But we still don't know much how Re:Zero world works. We don't know about its kingdoms, races, political structure and its power system. Everything appears to be random.

Ram and Rem, are considered as moving and breathing characters in the story. They both have unique personalities that differentiate them from one another. They have an interesting back story that fleshes out their character. It gave us some valuable insights into the world of Re: Zero. The story bothers to show us, their character progression. From the moment they introduce and up to the moment the story end. They stick around from start to finish. Giving you the time to get to know them and actually cared for them more than the protagonist and main heroine.

They are properly layered characters, especially when it comes to Rem’s character Arc. Rem’s dark past is a good stand-alone story of its own. The insecurities and doubt, Rem developed upon herself because of how the village she came from treated her. The village considered Ram a prodigy while Rem is the opposite. This led to Rem ever so growing inferiority complex towards her twin-sister Ram. After her twin-sister sudden misfortune, a quick relief lifting in her chest. This enforces Rem's subconscious envy and agony built upon over, just because of Ram simply existing. The heavy guilt soon follows after Rem realizes the mere fact that Ram is the only person in her village that actually loved her. That experience, psychological scars Rem's heart. She left to believe that she is held responsible for the misfortune of her twin-sister Ram. And Rem felt obligated to become Ram’s replacement. Even though Rem manages to surpass Ram in many tasks. She still believes she will never be better than her older sister Ram. Rem will never happy or be please in her life. Carrying a huge burden that her twin sister Ram never asked for in the first place. And that folks are an example of good character writing present in the show. Then I wish the show should have a focus on its other characters more.

Though I have some complaints about Rem's extreme devotion to Subaru is beyond me. It felt like her character was completely rewritten after her character arc finished. For the sake of pandering to the audience. Though Rem developing affection towards Suburu is reasonable. But the fact that she is willing to die for him on many occasions, is not something I can actually buy as believable. 

But Subaru and Rem shared the same dark insecurity and complexities. So there is romantic character chemistry. Rem is my favorite character in the show. I actually cared for her, given she is the best-written character in the entire story. 

The show's capabilities to reset and rewrite its story holds a major toll on some characters. The characters that had critical roles initial pace of the story somewhat become unimportant in later episodes. Their achievement, contribution, and progression become non-existent after a few story rewrites. There are 2 characters that greatly suffered this backlash.

The first character that suffers character regression is Emilia, the main heroine of the show. She was introduced as a strong, kind-hearted, and reliable individual. I see her worthy candidate for a ruler in the royal election. Emilia is the first person to show selfless kindness to Subaru in the first timeline. And that’s the only positive I can say about her character and that’s how her novel story as layered main heroine ends. 

Her badass magic-user role, which made her a respectable character in the first few episodes, was swapped to your typical submissive housewife or “wifu” role in some sort. 

Your fragile ""wifu"" you want to protect in your arms and get lap pillows with. Emilia is only there to serve as “emotional support” and “character improvement” to our beloved Suburu. Emilia becomes a sitting duck for the majority of the show. Letting other characters do the dirty work in which she can take part, with no problem. She was given the role of a useless princess. Her only purpose to get a “Wow” reaction to Suburu super amazing achievements. Though the same can be said to Rem, She also becomes a submissive housewife to Subaru on later Arcs. But the role Rem did over the course of the story serves a much more meaningful impact on the protagonist's journey. Rather than being a wife that serves as a lap-pillow. And it’s funny that Suburu role becomes a fragile girl that complaints a lot in later arcs. Suburu is useless in combat and wouldn’t survive a second without Rem saving his sorry ass. Emilia's regression of badass dynamic heroine becoming a damsel of distress in the final arc of the story is one of the negative consequences a story rewrite can do. It just made me sad.  

This is my complaint and my analysis of how they treated their main heroine. Emilia becomes a pillow for Suburu to hug upon achieving his goal. Emilia becomeing an object to serve as the protagonist trophy.

Another character that suffers Re: Zero plot rewriting shenanigans is Romanée-Conti, Petelgeuse. The main antagonist of the last story arc. He is intimidating not because of his crazy mannerisms and demented personality. But for the fact, He commanded the witch cult that is responsible for slaughters many civilians and characters. Petelgeuse track record in human fatalities is proof of how dangerous he is. He’s careful planning and coordinated attacks in the Roswaal mansion is no laughing joke. Petelgeusei alone has broken abilities that can instantly kill his opponent in no time and you're not going to have a good time fighting him head-on. But how can a plot reset make this kind of villain irrelevant or unimportant? Petelgeusei intimidating track record for being a dangerous antagonist got negated in just a few time reset. All his carefully plan tactics and tricks become a joke. The only thing that gave the antagonist the chance for winning is the element of surprise. But it was rectified in front of the witch-cult faces. Petelgeusei becomes a clown at this point. Getting confused on how on earth did their opponent knew every trick and plan they have in their sleeves. Petelgeusei cowering in madness on how his opponent knows his abilities in a comedic manner. So, in the end, Petelgeusei becomes a forgettable character not because of how he is written but how the story treats conflict as a joke. What’s the point of risk if the main protagonist can try and try until he perfects his ideal outcome. Rendering all our antagonist efforts fruitless. Suburu certainly has an overpowered ability. You are only interested in how will the protagonist will approach and solve this conflict. Which by the way enjoyable to watch to some extent. 

Finally, we reached the last character in the show. Our beloved main protagonist, Subaru, Natsuki. He is the common bland hyperactive and ambitious kind-hearted character. He is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of his friends and loved ones. Your typical Isekai protagonists. Nothing is much known about him. We have no knowledge about his life, family, and friends. 

We only know a few things, like how he knows simple work-out and basic self-defense presented in the series. He never worries or gives remorse about the people he known from his original world. This proves to be a problem for his motivation is somewhat questionable. This questionable motivation work in favor of the story to move forward. 

Thought his motivation seems pure and honest in early episodes. Analyzing further down Suburu personality. Subaru has the so-called ""Nice Guy"" syndrome. He believes that after what he has done to save his friends from a gruesome faith, especially Emilia. That he deserved to be repaid with love and affection. Even though it's a natural trade-in, that people usually pay back kindness with kindness. After the unexpected humiliation Suburu experience with Julius. Which by the way Subarus's own fault for being stubborn and obnoxious. Not only Subaru embarrassed himself in front of a huge audience. But he also created a bad impression on other people and especially on the people who believe in him. This further worsens, by the fact. He never admitted he is the one at fault. And Suburu passes the blame towards Emilia, proclaiming his action is all for her benefits. He then tries to guilt-trip Emilia. That she is in debt with him and she must be grateful for what he did for her. Demanding overcompensation for treating her special. Even though Emilia never asked about any of the Suburus actions in the first place. This scene alone revealed Suburu true sinister intentions. It flips the table on Subaru's previous kind-hearted motivations.


His self-entitled, clingy and over-the-top behavior towards Emilia. It was only a selfish scheme to force Emilia's to become Suburu's girl. This destroys my viewpoint about him as a person. This scene back-up his Nice-Guy Syndrome as a selfish and manipulative person. I started to develop a sort of distaste and hate towards him. But that didn’t last long after I watched Subaru's redemption arc as a character and as a person in general. My opinion has changed.

Episode 18 is the main turning point for me if I will still want to continue the franchise or not. With all the violence, character deaths and complaints I had with the characters. Especially when it comes to the protagonist. Everything reverted back to zero at that point. Let me explain why. I appreciate how the anime staff handles Subaru’s redemption. For once in the series, that we get to finally know Suburu as a person. He was given the chance to speak out all his frustration to Rem. To admit his flaws that he is not the person that he makes out to be. Confessing his a weak and selfish self-entitled person. He’s tired and only wanted to release all the stress he made for himself. He explains why he keeps repeating the same mistakes. He is aware of his stubborn personality is the reason why he wasn’t able to make any good decisions. He's afraid to be left behind. He felt inferior and he needs to be somebody else to compensate for his insecurities. It only took one episode. By just letting Suburu talk about himself in the entire episode is just brilliant for me.  Just allowing Subaru to honestly speak all his burden to Rem. While Rem function as a vessel for Subaru to reach out to the viewers his side of the story is more than enough for me to forgive him. Even I dislike most of the decisions and actions he made towards other people. It proves that he’s willing to learn and accept the mistake he made. He is willing to correct his flaws. In a later episode, he tried to communicate with other people properly, not screaming in front of their faces like a tantrum child. The proof that he’s an actual person that you understand and sympathize with. It gives you a reason to care for him. It is understandable that nobody is perfect. And people have strengths and weaknesses. After this revelation, I have no reason to hate him. And made the remaining episode more enjoyable to watch. And this ends my long speech when it comes to characters. After episode 18 I started to accept what  Re: Zero is all about. They finally made Suburu an actual main character for once. 


Enjoyment (7/10)

When comes to personal reference. Re: Zero is a roller coaster of a ride of an anime. It has ups and downs. There are times that I really love it, there are also times that is the complete opposite. My opinion changes in every episode. I question what Re: Zero is trying to do? It is anime that uses violence for entertainment? Those it has a hidden agenda? What is this anime trying to tell me in the circle of life? Then I got to the conclusion that Re: Zero it not so bad of a show. It didn’t go for cheap fan service that other anime is an expert of. It focuses on explaining and telling a story than diverting your attention to other unnecessary scenes like bath scenes or girls changing their clothes or ecchi jokes in general. There is nothing to hate or offensive about the anime except for Subaru’s actions and behavior but later he was fixed to be an understandable human being. The best thing I can say when coming to personal opinions. Re: Zero is an interesting and engaging show. It is entertaining in every moment. I didn’t get bored watching the show so that is also a compliment.  


Overall Score and Impression (6.4/10) Above Average

After all said the positive and negative things I said about Re: Zero. I say Re: Zero is an alright show. Though it is not unique or special like other people say it to be. Re: Zero didn’t shy away on its concept being an anime about being Deus Ex Machina anime times 10 but embrace it and tries to tell an interesting story. I like the story, even though I have some fair amount of complaints. The characters are interesting and some I actually cared for. Soundtracks and music is a bonus gift. The art style and animation is fan service. The anime has the chances to be great but it walks in a sturdy pedestal and tries to be loud even it doesn’t need to be, It stumbles because of it. It’s an above-average show at best. And I am looking forward to the next season to be released.


Do I recommend it? First I would like to urge people to watch Stein Gate and the Higurashi Franchise first before they try out Re: Zero. For the reason, they need some reference to better understand the anime and make a solid decision whether they like it or not. Stein Gate and Higurashi share the same concept and ideas of Re: Zero Time Resets but they are handle in a different approach.


I thank you guys, who given the time to read my review.


I appreciate your feedback and opinions about the show."

I feel like this will eventually become like the new SAO where there is just such a divide in the community in terms of its quality. 

Re:Zero stumbles early on but manages to prop itself back up in the middle but then falls apart worse then ever before. The characters are annoying, bland given useless backstories and most of them are just introduced to feel up the screen and i can compare Subaru and Emilia's Romance to Anakin and Padme's from the Star wars prequel trilogy, where Subaru would
                  ...
constantly go back for Emilia and i could never think of a reason why or but Subaru could think of 2000 apparently (kill me). The action for what its worth does look good but im a story and character guy mostly so if it has great action every now and then but im not invested it just looks like money wasted. Also the fact that they havent even hinted at why Subaru is in the world just pisses me of cause i feel like there should be a reason and whenever something interesting starts to happen or is hinted at the show completely ignores it (Subaru being pride but just being like nah). The villains are extremely weak, not threatening and not given as much screen time as they should have been so they can properly develop so when the characters are scared over the edge lord Betelguese you dont understand why cause he is kind of funny. Also due to semi cliched nature of the last third of the show you can just predict the final outcome. 

Sound was fine but nothing to memorable for me not gonna waste time on it.

By the end of the show when Subaru died i wish he stayed dead and the show would end, but i was not so lucky. This review is all over the place and not very formal but this is just me letting my unfiltered, not spell checked and formatted opinions out there. 

If you like Re:Zero thats fine, i know im in the minority but to me personally it represents what is wrong with not only the anime medium, fans and culture but basic story telling across all forms of entertainment"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Not Recommended,"Re:Zero is not one of those generic animes that almost anyone with a little bit of taste in the fantasy genre can enjoy, regardless of the things that keep bothering him such as excessive fan service or frustrating plot inconsistencies. No. Re:Zero is much, much worse than that. It’s a show that is aware of its own flaws but is surprisingly okay with them. It even points out several clichés and generic characters as they were mere facts. Re:Zero admits that it’s overwhelming and boring to use those elements again, and again, but uses them anyway and tries to hide them with violence and melodrama.

The
                  ...
show starts as a joke of almost every fantasy anime using the main character as the perfect parody tool, making him say satirical things like: “This must be the event where I cast my spell. Ha!”, “Where’s my protagonist status?” and “Where’s the cute girl who summoned me?” but then the story quickly settles down and becomes a serious matter. It’s like the writer wanted to tell us: “We get it. We know that you’re tired of this overused fantasy world, but we’re going to use it anyway”. We laugh because we know that they’re right, even though we feel like we’re giving them the permission to use it. After starting on a parodic tone, Re:Zero slowly becomes darker and darker throughout the episodes, using horror and drama as its main genres. It gives us this unusual feeling that it’s original and appealing unlike its siblings, by ending almost each episode with a dramatic cliffhanger (sudden death of a character for example). And the problem is, it takes advantage of it EVERY episode to shock the viewer by making the main character look miserable and pathetic to the point that it becomes repetitive and melodramatic. The writer has one rule: each episode MUST end with a cliffhanger whether it makes sense or not. Re:Zero hides under a carpet of clichés and uses drama as an excuse to get away with it. Many people don’t have a problem with this. They actually find it awesome and thrilling. But I don’t. I find it exaggerated and unnecessary. What we need is a real explanation of the story, but sadly there is none: the story is divided into small or long arcs so there is no “story line”. What we demand is a motive, a goal that our main character has to achieve, a reason why certain characters act the way they do, a character development or a background story and NOT a sudden character transformation into the “Good Guy”, nor a romance that’s going nowhere. Unfortunately, we get nothing. Nothing at all. There is no attractive story and the characters are badly written. The whole show is painful to watch and makes you want to break your screen.

Please note that some sections in this review contain some spoilers. Feel free to skip those sections indicated by a *.

Let’s start with the bad elements:

•STORY: It seems that nowadays, new animes are basically copy-pasting what’s popular (be it an idea, a set of characters, a setting…) and keep twisting it around until it becomes better. One of the major problems in Re:Zero is that it can’t decide what it wants to be so instead it becomes everything at the same time: parody, horror, mystery, slice of life, comedy, action… And you can’t just pile up all those elements and expect a good and comprehensible story. What is Re:Zero trying to be? That’s the question that I’ve been asking myself (and still is) the whole time. Because to me, the anime fails in every aspect: there is nothing mysterious that you have to find out. Instead, some elements are brought up once and then completely forgotten later (characters, plot elements…). The slice of life (the mansion arc) is unnecessary and repetitive: it doesn’t develop the relationship between the characters. It insults it because the time-travel resets everything. The comedy is also removable as it doesn’t relieve the tension, because there is no suspense to begin with. It’s a time-travel fantasy where the main character never dies and keeps respawning back in time to try again and again until he manages to save everyone. It’s like playing an arcade game where you have an unlimited amount of credits. You’ll win the game eventually. 

1) DRAMA: The drama fails due to a simple plot device that keeps the show going: time-travel. Many writers don’t take this sensitive element seriously in their Si-Fi’s and fantasies, and use it whenever and however they want to. But the real advantage in using time-travel in a fantasy is allowing the writer to tell the story in a different kind of narrative: use of different characters and scenarios, seeing the story in another character’s point of view… Time-travel can easily lead to a suspenseful and interesting story if used correctly. However, if it is triggered when the person holding the ability dies, it becomes a little bit more difficult to handle. The main character’s emotional state becomes crumbled with fears and traumas after each death, whereas from now on, each character who will die besides him will have absolutely no effect on us because we already know that anyone can come back from the dead by time-travel. So the point of this “Rewind by Death” is not to shock the viewer, but rather the character. And the sad part is that everyone thinks it’s the same thing. It’s not. You’re feeling sorry for the main character, and not the person who has just died in front of him. And why should you sympathize with a useless main character who doesn’t do a single thing during the whole show? Nevertheless, the drama is forced due to the vicious cycle of death-rewind. It lost its value when the writer made this poor choice of allowing the MC to reset the day when he dies. So stop trying to force it, it’s not working. 

2) CLICHÉS: I already mentioned this at the beginning, but Re:Zero is still full of clichés no matter how much you want to deny it. Think of it: knights, castles, elves, witches, “lizard people”, “ground dragons”, actual dragons, apples that look exactly like ones but are called “appas” (talk about originality), lolis, maids… The problem is that the show is aware of all of those lame and overused elements. For example, the MC refers the small and cute characters as “lolis” and barely use their actual name. So in the end, we can’t really say that the fantasy world in Re:Zero is original because the setting and characters are nothing we haven’t seen already. And changing the name of a known fruit is not going to help, sorry. Re:Zero is based on a whole bunch of clichés, and made this very clear to us. This seems ironic given that it’s a cliché and is trying so hard not to be. 

3) CLIFFHANGERS: The cliffhangers are poor. Some of them are too predictable, others are too unexpected and impossible to believe. Cliffhangers must make a little bit of sense and more importantly be relevant to the story but instead, they are used left and right for shock purposes. It’s not shocking if it’s not convincing, and it’s not convincing if it’s not provided with any proof. Even the MC doesn’t understand what’s going on anymore, so how can we? One or two cliffhangers are fine, but if you’re going to end each episode with one because you want more drama to your story then it’s not going to work. The viewer will eventually get bored after playing the long and famous game: “Who’s going to die next?” And the answer is too obvious: Subaru, and maybe another character that we don’t care about.

*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*

An example of a typical cliffhanger is the episode where we learn that one of the maids Rem killed the MC. Get this: a loyal maid trying to kill the totally-not-suspicious guest who tried to save her master more than once. This was way out-of-character. She didn’t even talk about her suspicions with anyone, and didn’t even provide any evidence. The only thing suspicious about Subaru was his witch scent, but everybody knew that and nobody really cared to bring that up again. 

How about the episode where our MC commits suicide, but then becomes too scared to die again and let the ""plot conveniences"" (some random monster you don’t know yet) take care of that? Why raise more questions when you can simply avoid them by letting him commit suicide again? And we're talking about a desperate and hopeless guy who wants to save EVERY SINGLE character he meets, even villains who tried to kill him once. And that’s definitely not going to work if he’s going to wait for something or someone to kill him so he can reset everything. He’s wasting his time, and ours.

There’s also an episode where Rem is brutally killed in front of Subaru because the killer wanted him to feel guilty and bad. That’s the reason why there are so many deaths in this show: to traumatize the main character, and not us. Because killing a character in this show is unbelievable and pathetic. It’s like faking death: we already know that whoever dies is not really dead and will come back by Rewind.

*END OF SPOILERS*

The endings are executed in a way to keep the suspense and thrill but in the end it’s just for a cheap shock value to keep you hanging and wanting more.

4) PLOT CONVENIENCES: The story doesn’t look appealing nor smart at all. Why? The plot conveniences are everywhere, not to mention too easy to spot. This makes the characters look manipulated instead of independent.

The first issue is that all the deaths are forced and used against the MC in order to traumatize him. 

*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*

In episode 14, Subaru arrives at the mansion only to find everyone dead. He then blindly walks into a suspicious ice room and suddenly freezes to death by some curse just after hearing someone whispering to him: “You’re too late”. That’s right: Subaru waits to be killed by the unknown because letting him commit suicide will be nuisance to the writer, since Subaru will take advantage of it every time and use it whenever something bad happens. Instead, the writer let him witness everything because he wants to traumatize him even more, kills him using someone/something we don’t know about, and later on tries to justify it. That’s not smart. That’s running away from a logical path that the character could have taken.

An episode later, Subaru gets his head chopped off by the same monster. His death is not only absurd, but confusing. After we learn the monster’s identity, we then come to the conclusion that killing Subaru in this way doesn’t feel right. It was not his fault. It never was. The monster could have prevented all of this, but didn’t because Subaru HAD to die. It’s almost as if he let him die on purpose. And the writer tries to justify his poor excuse of making this monster kill Subaru even if it doesn’t look compatible with the monster’s personality. 

Another issue is a very annoying plot armor: the inability to inform anyone about the Rewind ability, either by killing the person holding the ability or by killing the person listening about it. Subaru needs to suffer ALONE before transforming into a completely different person. If he ever tries to alert someone, he starts hallucinating and seeing a witch’s hand coming from the dark grabbing his heart. Let’s say for the sake of argument that this is part of the witch’s curse. Couldn’t he IMPLY that he has been there before or that this was a Deja-vu? Repeating a character’s line for example, predicting his actions and movements… Is it that hard? (like the MC in “All You Need is Kill” or its movie adaption “Edge of Tomorrow”). But of course that’s too much for Subaru. He can barely lift a sword, literally. What about the other characters? Are they like Subaru incompetent and indifferent? Just by observing a person’s behavior, you can tell that there is something wrong with him, or that he may have experienced this before. We get to see one of the characters who barely shows on-screen saying that there’s something off about Subaru’s eyes, and that he looks like he experienced many deaths and traumas, but keeps it to himself. It seems that no one really cares about Subaru or pay any attention to him, and I guess it’s normal given his personality.

The writer needs something that can emphasize the drama. Every episode, from 1 till 18, someone HAD to die or something bad HAD to happen so Subaru can feel guilty, because that’s all on him. He’s the only one who can prevent this using his ability but nobody can help him because they’re not allowed to. So this is really a cheap plot armor that is barely justified by the writer. It is used to traumatize the MC, and it takes way too long that the trauma eventually becomes impossible to erase or overcome. So how, in just one single episode, did Subaru magically overcome his trauma that began since the very first episode and turned into a completely different person? But we’ll get to that later.

After episode 18, the drama fades away, because it did what it had to do: make the MC suffer alone using a simple tool: time-travel, while preventing him from telling anyone about it, since it would hurt the show so badly it would end in 12 episodes instead.

The story is also riddled with plot holes. The writer doesn’t explain why Subaru is suddenly transported to another world and then cursed by a Witch who doesn’t show up in the end. He doesn’t explain how the “save point” works. One of the most obvious examples is the episode 23 where Subaru respawns back to the strategy meeting after the White Whale battle and says: “Wow. My save point was updated!”, which is the same as him implicitly saying “Thanks writer, even though I have no idea what happened!”.

5) FILLERS: The story doesn’t have a sense of continuity because it’s divided into small and unrelated stories. Some of them are short and acceptable, others are fillers to lengthen the drama and waste our time. I’m going to explain the real reason behind those removable parts of the show, so I’m most likely going to give examples.

*OBVIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD*

The Mansion and the Village Arc (Episode 4 to 12): This whole arc has one purpose based on an absurd claim: to strengthen the relationship between Subaru and Rem after she killed him several times because she thought he was a threat to the whole mansion. This is why it’s absurd: she’s JUST a maid so it’s not up to her to decide who lives and who dies. The fact that she’s even trying to kill a guy that has done nothing more than being nice to everyone and helping them because he’s in debt is beyond ridiculous. Subaru tries to convince her that he’s innocent but she doesn’t even listen to him. Beatrice act as his witness and tries to justify his innocence but fails. He blames himself for that and tries to figure things out because his life is at stake here, and not because he cares about Rem. So this arc is just another way for him to escape death by building a fake relationship between a maid so he can earn her trust. The writer makes Rem act irrational and out-of-character by accusing an innocent guy with no evidence whatsoever so he can give this arc a meaning. So if this isn’t filler, what is?

The Royal Selections (Episode 13): This episode has one goal: to get Subaru into a fight with Emilia. How? By making him look as ridiculous and pathetic as possible in front of everyone. The episode looks like a joke because not one single character in it takes the situation seriously. Subaru keeps screaming and shouting at anyone who insults Emilia. One of the council of elders is caring enough to ask him who he is and if he is done with his painful speech already instead of throwing him out instantly. Felt (one of the eligible candidates) also makes a scene screaming at Reinhard and asking him what she is doing here (I mean, isn’t it obvious?) but later on claims that she will kill everyone in this town if she ever becomes the queen, because to her that’s what a perfect ruler should do. Priscilla claims that she will become a tyrant and make everyone kneel before her, while Anastasia informs us that she’s too greedy and wants her own nation. Old Man Rom literally pops out from the ground to save the day and Emilia finally kicks Subaru out of the room after getting embarrassed in front of everyone. In other words, the introduction of the candidates which was supposed to be the whole point of the episode happened too fast and eventually turned out to be another cringe moment for the viewer.

The White Whale Arc (Episodes 19 to 21): the main objective of this arc is to make Subaru look smart and helpful, showing us a contrast between his old personality. This arc is no more than just a fight against a giant floating whale that takes up to 40 minutes when it could have ended instantly. Yes, the fight looks serious and cool, but what does it have to do with the story? Isn’t Subaru’s current objective to save Emilia, and not to waste his time running around a monster while teasing it? Wilhelm thanks him even before the fight because defeating this monster is avenging his dead wife, so it’s kind of a big deal for him. In other words, the writer makes the arc look serious and necessary to everyone so we don’t complain about it, and here I am trying to figure out the whole point of it. I think Subaru’s priority is to defeat the guys who killed Emilia in the first place (The Witch worshipers), and not a random monster who killed him once. 

*END OF OBVIOUS SPOILERS*

•CHARACTERS: If you thought the story was bad, just wait and see what’s even worse. 
The characters are too plain. They have up to 2 noticeable characteristics and once they do their job, they are thrown away into the garbage and completely erased from the show. Moreover, most of their lines and dialogues sound cheesy and messed up. Here are some examples:

“Do I look clever to you?” 

“You are still Emilia’s dog” 

“Explain this to Emilia and the loli”

“That was a vague order, but alright”

“Thank you for being defeated”

""Only I'm allowed to sniff Subaru""

“Love love love love love love love love love love love…”

“That was perfectly well-coordinated. Did you guys practice that for this meeting?”

""Will you be quiet? I'm trying to make myself look good.""

This is not a joke. Those are actual lines from the show that are applied to serious situations like fights, meetings, convincing a certain character about something, giving an order. In general, the characters are well-presented (art, animations, voice) but look dumb when they talk so it’s impossible for you to take them seriously. It’s like they don’t even care about their situation as much as we do. They talk because they NEED to, whether what they say makes any difference or not. They don’t have a mind of their own. They are just following the writer’s orders without thinking like a reasonable human being.

1) MAIN CHARACTER: To put it simply, Subaru is an 18-years old that acts as if he’s 12. He has a special ability that lets him rewind time by his own death but he barely takes advantage of it and doesn’t really explore its limitations. He thinks of it as a joke and doesn’t understand what he’s truly capable of. In the first episode, it took him 5 seconds to realize that he’s been transported into a fantasy world: “It's safe to assume that this is a fantasy world” (Episode 1, minute 3), but when he dies the first time and resets the day, it took him almost 2 episodes to understand that he can time-travel by death (did I mention that he’s a NEET who plays video games and watches movies all day?). And what’s worse is that when he goes back in time, he takes the same routes and doesn’t try out new ones. He goes to the same alley where he got mugged last time and screams to the thieves: “You again?”. This is a time-travel fantasy, shouldn’t you at least explore different paths, meet different characters, and for the love of God question yourself: “How did I get here?” or “How do I get out of this place?”

In other similar shows like SAO, GATE and KonoSuba, the main character voluntarily travels to a fantasy world, so he doesn’t need to find a way out of it since he knows what he’s doing. So why does Subaru who is suddenly transported to another world take the situation so lightly that he doesn’t even TRY to escape. He accepts everything that happens to him AND everyone that he meets without using his brain.
Instead of searching for a way out of this world or getting rid of the curse, he ends up hunting for waifus, from maids to princesses to cat girls, because to him that’s more important than safety. 

Subaru is one of those main characters who pretends to be the “know-it-all” but actually has zero intelligence. He doesn’t do anything in this show; it’s that simple. Instead, he just let the other characters do their job as he sits idly, claiming that he will save everyone. Hell, he even admits it later. There’s one sentence that could sum up his personality: “Go with the flow”. And by flow I mean plot. Subaru’s role is to blindly follow the plot without thinking twice. He repeats the same mistakes over and over again because he NEEDS to die so he can reset everything or wait for something “shocking” to happen in the end of the episode. In other words, he acts this way for the sake of the drama-cycle (so he can die, reset, then die again…)

Subaru’s second role is to over-dramatize the show, either by making an irrational decision, regretting it later and blaming himself for everything (even though it’s not his fault. He feels guilty because he knows he can do something about it but doesn’t) or becoming completely traumatized and unable to speak. One of the writer’s main objectives is to show us a development of his mental state (from best to worse) but it becomes exaggerated and too dramatic. There’s a whole episode where he doesn’t speak a single word because he witnessed another death: he has given up, but he hasn’t done anything AT ALL so how can he easily give up? Death is a serious matter, but not when you can reset it by time-travelling. It’s almost as if you’re taking advantage of it, since this will help you avoid it next time by exploring different possibilities. I don’t want to spoil another anime, but go watch Magical Girl Madoka and you’ll know what I mean. 

Subaru also changes his behavior every time the plot demands it. Sometimes, he makes a scene because the show needs more drama. Sometimes, he doesn’t and completely turns off his psychological scars by pretending nothing happened because the drama needs to cool off at some point. He saves a maid who killed him once while pretending that she didn’t. He ends up protecting a thief named Felt while pretending that she’s not the reason why he and Emilia died in the first place.

Subaru wants to feel like a main character even though he’s not, at least not to me. You can almost hear his screams “Notice me! I’m important too” when he throws a tantrum in the royal selections episode and gets mad at anyone who insults Emilia, even in the episode where a Knight simply kissed her hand showing his respect towards her. On the other hand, Subaru acts like an ex-boyfriend who’s still overprotective towards his supposed girlfriend. He claims that he’s a Knight that’s going to protect her in a room full of Imperial Knights while wearing a track suit and shouting like a complete idiot but that’s just too pathetic because he simply can’t. Everyone knows that. He knows that. Consequently, Subaru is beyond pathetic and cringe-worthy. He shouts that he’s going to save everyone and two minutes later he runs away begging for people to help him, to the point that he was willing to lick the foot of a princess. Yes, that’s how far he was going. 

After episode 18, Re:Zero becomes another “Find the missing Main Character” game (similar to Tokyo Ghoul Root A), where you have to question yourself: Who is the main character in this show? Is it Wilhelm, a Knight who suddenly becomes important to the plot and defeats the enemies in one swing of his sword? Is it Julius, a respectable spirit knight who acts as Subaru’s personal bodyguard? Or is it Subaru, the supposed main character who can only act as bait using his witch scent?

In episode 18, Subaru becomes self-aware and finally accepts his character: “What I am now is the result. All my powerlessness, all my incompetence, is the product of my rotten character (…) That’s right. I have no character”. If he was aware of his character the whole time, why didn’t he do anything about it? Why wait an endless 18 episodes to do so? And here’s the worse part: his character transformation is too sudden. After Rem’s speech, his personality makes a 180⁰: he becomes smart, patient and calm. This long speech barely seems convincing and powerful to completely turn a person’s personality upside down. It’s the personality that we’re talking about: it’s almost a built-in feature that you are born or raised with and it’s too difficult to change that quickly. It takes months, even years. And using Rem’s love confession is a weak excuse as it doesn’t suddenly make him a better person: it takes time.

There is no convincing character transformation, like the one we see in Tokyo Ghoul (where the MC was mistreated during the whole show and almost tortured to death before becoming a complete badass). Even though his character is written that way to make you hate him and then watch him overcome his flaws, it takes up to 18 episodes and in the end it doesn’t really succeed. After “Subaru’s second form”, he becomes a completely different person: calm, reasonable, smart... A true gentleman who admits his mistakes and forgives his enemies. It’s impossible to believe that 1 episode ago he was the same character. Subaru 2.0 still asks people for help because he can’t do anything on his own and acts as bait the whole time while others defeat the enemies. So what really changed in all of this? He made one good decision (a deal with a princess) and that was it. Then what’s the problem? He’s still weak and useless, but everyone accepts him as their hero and start helping him out for no reason: he gets his own army at his command, even though before no one knew about his existence and if they did they though he was a complete idiot. His character transformation is like night and day: one second he was irrational, stupid and thinks that he’s Rambo and then 1 episode later after one simple love confession everyone thinks of him as Napoleon executing the perfect plan or Gotham’s next Batman saving the entire city? I don’t buy this. 

Believe it or not, Re:Zero becomes another shonen after the MC’s “transformation”. Rem made it very clear to us when she kept insisting that Subaru is her Prince Charming. There are different factors involved. I’ve counted three so far: 

1) He informs the people about the whereabouts of the White Whale (a floating monster), because apparently nobody in this world can use their magic powers or a simple magic spell to track it down. 

2) In every single fight, he acts as bait using his witch scent while others defeat the enemy.

3) He risks his life by acting as bait again, and saves a random maid he barely knows by doing so. Not to mention that the risk is non-existent to him since he can reset time the moment he dies.

Doesn’t this seem a little bit insulting to other heroes out there, who try their best to defeat the enemy, using their different set of physical and mental skills? I’m not even convinced that Subaru is a main character, so how can I believe that he becomes a hero later?

Not to mention the overuse of soliloquy (a situation where the protagonist speaks his thoughts out loud so he can indirectly address himself to us). Subaru keeps screaming out loud ""OMG. I'm awesome!"", ""I look great!"" and ""I'm garbage"" so he can highlight his character. He points out clichés to tell us ""See? I'm aware of that, so it's not a cliché!"".

2) SECONDARY CHARACTERS: Well, let’s start will the main heroine Emilia. She is a kind and caring person but in reality she’s simply a cheap fan service element for a barely developed and non-reciprocal romance. She’s very naive as she welcomes Subaru into her home after knowing the guy for no more than 10 minutes and that he smelled like the Witch (a very despised figure in the show). In addition, Emilia’s character doesn’t get enough development and this seems crucial since the whole show is driven by the relationship between Subaru and Emilia. Think about it: if you remove her then everything else will lose its meaning: the maids, Subaru’s objective and decisions… Emilia can be considered as a plot engine, and some characters even admit it. Ram acknowledge Subaru as “Emilia’s dog” (actual line), not only because he acts as one (he barks at people he doesn’t like and defends his master without thinking) but also because the story wouldn’t have made any sense if his master was not in it. Isn’t this the plot device of the whole show: a relationship between a dog and his master? So why give more attention to side characters like Rem & Ram? Let’s analyze then each character so we can see for ourselves:

-Rem: a bipolar maid with no fixed personality. She starts as a kuudere, becomes a yandere and slaughters everyone, goes back to being cold to Subaru, goes completely insane, then becomes surprisingly kind, but later on turns into a typical tsuundere who can’t admit that she’s in love. So instead of creating more maids, the writer decided to mix all the possible personalities you can come up with into one bowl of a character, thinking that he created a character development instead. Rem acts as a supporting character as well as a fan service one. Try to remember what happened in episode 18: she falls in love with Subaru while telling us (and not him) a fantasy about them living together and having kids that we know will never happen so we can fantasize about it. And of course, she’s just another mindless puppet who makes the drama look even more dramatic by acting irrational all the time and getting herself killed. Her actions barely help the story and the MC. In fact, she once ran away from Subaru and went to the mansion all by herself only to be brutally killed. This was the only safe and logical decision she could think of. But in reality, she was just following the drama path: to shock and traumatize Subaru when he finds out that everyone is dead.

-Ram: Rem’s twin sister with a dull personality, unless you consider “cold and irrational” a type of personality. Her character design is almost the same as Rem’s (except for her hair color) but surprisingly she’s not giving any importance at all. She’s there because the writer needed a background story for Rem, then decided to throw her away since she did her job. In episode 23, she comes back, only this time to kill Subaru and his entire army because he left the mansion and ran away from his master: “So this is what it means to bite the hand that feeds you”. It was Emilia who asked Subaru to leave the mansion in the first place after they got into a fight and NOT him running away to a new master without telling anyone. It was a simple request, not a betrayal. So if she can’t even tell the difference, what can she really do?

3) SIDE CHARACTERS: Almost all the side characters seem completely static and hold no real meaning in the show. They are there because the story is not crowded enough and the writer needs some fillers.

-Wilhelm: His Sword training with Subaru doesn’t change anything. It’s just to show us that the MC is actually trying to do something for once, that he’s trying his best, but he fails in doing so and finally admits it. Wilhelm is suddenly giving more attention than primary characters when he got his own flashback about how he met his wife. He can almost be considered as a main character replacement for Subaru.

-Beatrice: a tsuundere loli who despises Subaru but ironically enjoys his company. She tries to help him by convincing Rem that he’s innocent but apparently that led to his suicide. 

-Reinhard: a.k.a “Mr. Nice Guy”. He’s an angel, a saint who helps Subaru out of the goodness of his heart but later on abducts a harmless child. Lolicon confirmed?

-Felt: too childish and ignorant. She blindly follows Reinhard without resisting and becomes one of the eligible candidates for becoming the ruler, only to ask him in a room full of princesses, Imperial Knights and people: “Why did you bring me here, and why am I dressed like that?” (most likely to relieve the tension). 

-Felis: your typical cat-girl who turns out to be a boy even though he acts, speaks, and looks like a girl. His job is to look cute and help others without interfering with the harem (like the one in Highschool DxD).

-Julius: a spirit knight who takes his role very seriously, until he becomes Subaru’s pet and obeys any order he gives him without complaining. 

-Roswaal Mathers: because the show needs another clown besides Subaru. He acts and speaks like a clown. That's his only unique trait.

- Betelgeuse (In English “Beetle Juice”): One of the 7 Sin-Archbishop representing Sloth. He reminds me of Nobuyuki Sugou: a one-dimensional, too-evil villain who becomes a joke in the show due to his funny way of speaking and acting.


Now for the good elements:

•ART & ANIMATION: The art looks really good and is actually nice to look at. The background scenes are noticeable enough and more detailed than usual. The choreographic scenes are fun to watch, others become repetitive but that’s fine. In conclusion, the art & animation is overall enjoyable.

•SOUND: The voice acting was acceptable except for some characters like Bettelgeuse: it was too high-pitched and was a pain to the ears. We get that he’s a villain but trying to make his voice as ugly and insane as he looks is just too much that he eventually becomes some sort of a joke in the show. We look at him and all we see is a Joker-wannabe but with a really annoying voice. Another voice acting that was supposed to be funny became extremely distracting and ruined the whole mood: Roswaal Mathers’ voice. It even makes you question his sexuality. 

Other voices are good, like Rem & Ram (same voice actress), Emilia, and most male characters.

The OP was also great. I never skipped it. Same thing for the ED, except I didn’t listen to it every time. I was too busy trying to figure out the ending.

•CONCLUSION: In a nutshell, Re:Zero is an obvious cliched fantasy that tries its best to appeal to the general public. What I mean by that is the typical “edgy” cliffhangers, the time-travel, the fantasy elements (cute maids, princesses, Knights… the usual), the horror elements (blood and gore… so it can look serious and addressed to adults), the melodrama (way too much), the harem... Now try imaging a show that has all of those elements and more. No wonder you’ll get a messy, scrambled anime that is not just confusing, but painful to watch. 
Re:Zero has a tendency to introduce certain characters but later on completely dispose of them as they were mere paper characters. Now the characters are one thing, but take a look at the story line: it’s not linear nor episodic. It’s lazy and filled with useless and boring arcs. It’s a whole bunch of stories, like a small book that you read to your child at night: it doesn’t make any sense but it’s a good way to make him fall asleep quickly. 

•ENJOYMENT:
I never enjoyed a single second in this show. Why should I? The story is divided into stories, the main character is pathetic, useless, and acts like an idiot but suddenly becomes the hero we all need by acting as bait the whole time. Some episodes were rushed, others were mere fillers and the cliffhangers are always there, whether they make sense or not. Fan service and forced drama win in the end, because that’s what people want nowadays.

Do I recommend this? Well, let’s see:

Do you like to watch a bunch of unrelated stories, each one in a different genre?

Do you enjoy watching a completely useless and static main character similar to a statue?

Do you have a problem with abusive drama and cliffhangers that don’t make any sense?

After you answer each question, you'll know what to do."

Ah, yes, Re:zero.

""Read the source, it explains everything!"" They said.

""Subaru totally grows and matures and is realistic!"" They said.

""You just hate him because you like Gary-stu!"" They said.

...
You know what, I read the WN even further than you LN fanboys so I can criticize Re:zero all I want. 

Story - 2

Re:zero starts with a boy named Subaru transported to another world then death, suffering and screaming happens. You see the fanboys like to pretend there is this cool mystery about why he got transported or who the witch of envy is and how the stake is totally high cause the world might end.

But it doesn't really matter, you see Re:zero uses the classic style of shitty mystery called ""making the character retarded and never ask the crucial questions"" such as Subaru never ask how he got transported or how his power works. 

""It is a deconstruction of Isekai work, huh dun dun, those characters never ask, huh dun dun"". Then you are not being realistic are you? score 1 for hypocrisy, just to rub salt in the world, a lot do ask. So Re:zero is merely deconstructing a straw man it created in its head.

Why does Subaru act like a hot-head moron? ""It deconstructs the shounen like protagonist, huh dun dun."" Ignoring that a lot of the shounen like protagonist actually fight pretty smart and knows what they are doing.

Why does the other characters never talks regularly? ""Because this is a deep mystery and there are conspiracy's and stuff, huh dun dun."" Which they immediately start explaining when the protagonist is about to loop, so Realistic.

Why does the evil witch cult characters act like rejected Danganropa characters? ""Cause that is what scary crazy villains act like, huh dun dun!"" So scary, guess that's why I was in tears laughing. I guess Hannibal lector, Yohan and all the other villains are total failures compared to the magnificent Re:zero.

And these pretty much is where Re:zero's plot fails, it tries to hide its generic ""girl world guy"" plot behind the excuse of ""deconstruction"" and ""mystery"" yet it fails to understand the very thing it is talking about. Isekai stories have a lot of varieties, everything Re:zero does had been done and made better in other places. On its own it is a shitty mystery, cause magic, there is no logic behind it, in fact if I sum up the answer to the mystery from even the later arcs it is summed up as ""The Witches did it!""

Character - 2

Subaru is the creation of an author who is up his own ass, about how he is amazing for going against the common flow. And this is true, you can actually find interviews or replies from the author anytime someone criticize him for creating an unlikable protagonist.

""No no, I meant to do that."" Yeah, you purposely created garbage, good job.

For all the fanboys defending Subaru is realistic or would grow, allow me to let you in on a little secret.

You know how he whines and push the blame onto everyone else, act like a prick, and never thinks before charging into something?

That never goes away, ever.

In fact he gets a character reset every arc, which goes, loop - bullshit happens - whine - loop - breakdown and scream at people helping him - loop - miraculously solve things because of luck - reset character arc.

So tell me, how can a man that never grows be realistic?

""You're just a hater, why you read/watch it if you hate it so much. You just don't understand.""

Beyond Subaru the amazingly emo MC, the other characters are not that good as well, since time loop, there is basically no consistent growth. Especially Emilia whose characteristics never moves past the ""nice lonely love interest"", I literally cannot think of another word to her personality, she is blank.

Rem and Ram have a bit of character, but Rem suffers from character rewrite as she is in love with the MC to an unbelievable extent. And they get toss on to a bus anyway.

Others doesn't matter, they appear, they leave, leaving no long lasting impact as the story doesn't revolve around them.

Art, Sound - wasted

Overall - 3
Garbage torture edgelord material, if Akame ga kill and stein's gate had a baby, this would be that. And on the quality side, this definitely approaches akame ga kill's horribleness more."

Re:Zero -The Aesthetic Appeal-

2016 has seen a good number of entertaining anime. Shows like ReLIFE, Food Wars The Second Plate, Kiznaiver, Planetarian, Erased, My Hero Academia, Hey! My Name is Sakumoto, And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online, Flying Witch, High School Fleet, Heavy Object, and a number of other anime that I'm not going to name right now. The point is, a lot of really entertaining anime have come out this year. Among those anime is Re:Zero Starting Life in Another World.

Re:Zero is an anime that exploded in popularity almost overnight, and I'm not saying this just
                  ...
because it's my favorite anime of 2016. I remember when I finished watching the first episode, which had been split into two parts, and then going onto facebook the next day and finding a facebook page already created. That in itself wouldn't have been shocking. However, this page already had over 30,000 likes. Since then, that page has expanded and now has around 160,000 likes. There are also two more pages that I follow, one of which has 155,000 likes and the other with around 60,000.

If that wasn't enough, then there's also the fact that this anime has received more votes on Crunchyroll per episode within the first few days than any other series. This anime has been so hyped that I'm pretty sure it's already beaten numerous other popular series in terms of how many fans it's gained within a short time frame.

The first aspect of the series that I want to talk about is the aesthetic appeal. Re:Zero is an anime that boasts some beautiful artwork and what I like to call animated cinematography. Throughout the series we're given numerous large, sweeping shots of cityscapes, landscapes, and various gorgeous locations all rendered in breathtaking detail. I was particularly impressed with the sunset shots, which seemed to be a favorite of this anime. There are many of them.

What I enjoyed about these shots wasn't just how pretty they were, but how they showed us the size of this world. The world of Re:Zero is massive. I remember watching the first episode when Subaru is first sent to this Lugnica. We're given a kind of close up of Natsuki Subaru, and then it pulls back before shifting into a wide view of the capital city of Lugnica. Just looking at how wide and sprawling that cityscape is as it mixes with the viridian of the forest, and then you have that interesting view of the castle in the far distance was incredible. It was scenes like this that made me really think about how utterly massive this world must be.

Another visual appeal of the series was how diverse Lugnica's people are. Throughout the series we're given more than just humans. There's lizardmen, dog people, cat people, and they're not just humans with cat ears. A fare few of them look legitimately like anthropomorphic animals. I even remember seeing one person who looked like an otter in priest robes and an alligator. Even the characters that you only see passing Subaru throughout various scenes gives the series a sense of their being a lot more to this world than the small story about Subaru and his misadventures.

And speaking of Subaru, can I just say that I really like his character design. First, he's got these sort of narrowed eyes and slicked back hair, which are generally associated with thugs in Japan. It actually doesn't necessarily fit the “otaku stereotype” and has often made me wonder if his looks might be part of the reason he became a NEET. I feel like there's a backstory behind his appearance and how people back in his world associated with them.

And, of course, we can't forget the tracksuit. The tracksuit is actually an Otaku stereotype in Japan. I don't know how true it is since I've never been to Japan, but I've read on several blogs that a lot people who fall under the Otaku/NEET/Hikkikomori stereotype wear tracksuits because it's easy to change into and out of, and these types of people generally never leave their house except to buy food. This is actually the reason I like seeing Subaru in the tracksuit. Thanks to how unique this anime is among other isekai anime, seeing this stereotype taken and used in a way that disregards most of what we expect from this genre makes his outfit stand out.

That being said, if we're talking about main characters, then there's no way I can forget the heroine. From the moment Emilia was introduced, I was in love with her character design. Her unique appearance practically screams main heroine in all caps. First, she's the only character with silver hair. Her eyes are purple, but the pupils are green, which is an interesting artistic touch and makes me wonder if this has something to do with her status as a half elf.

Speaking of half elf, Emilia really falls into that archetype with her short, pointed ears. They immediately stood out when I first noticed them, and there's a nice bit of asymmetry going with the added white rose that's asfixed to the right side of her hair, and the butterfly hair clip that's attached to her bangs on the other side. The flower is a lot more prominent, especially because the purple ribbon offsets the white rose, which is compliments her hair.

Following her face, Emilia's introduction has her wearing a white dress with purple accents and some gold thrown in for color. I don't think I need to mention this, but the outfit really flatters her. From the very first glance, the outfit is designed to make her stand out. Furthermore, this isn't the only outfit that we see her in. Because this anime is about Subaru. Emilia isn't always seen since she's usually busy learning how to become a ruler. To make up for her lack of screen time, the director has her change clothes numerous times as a way to make her stand out more. I know some people who will debate this point, but I think it does a good job of that. I can always notice Emilia the moment she's entered a scene, and my eyes tend to track her even when she's not necessarily the subject of the scene.

To top it off, Emilia is almost always seen with Puck, the cute mascot character who is actually likable. Puck is one of those characters who's cuteness as been maximized. He's like that adorable kitty you want to take home with you. In some ways, I might even call him a show stealer. What makes his aesthetic even more appealing is how he can transform into a huge ass monster that's anything but cute.

There are numerous other characters who've been given a design that enhances the visual appeal and makes the anime shine. Rem and Ram are two such characters. They're maids and twin sisters. Now, maids are sort of a staple in Japanese culture. Maids often appear in anime and manga because they symbolize what many Japanese consider to be appealing in women: attractive, subservient, and cute. Rem and Ram are the characters who I feel were designed to encapsulate the “moe” character archetype.

Unlike most anime, which have threadbare maid designs that are meant to be more sexually appealing, and are often worn on the character with the largest amount of cleavage, the designs on Rem and Ram are a bit more modest. They strike a decent balance between being sexy and being functional. I also like how they're contrasting Red and Blue hair and eyes make them stand out from each other.

I feel like there was no expense spared when producing this anime. I don't even want to think about what kind of budget this series had. Not only was the diverse world and myriad of characters gorgeous to look at from every angle, but the animation feels incredibly fluid from the first frame to the last. While I did notice a few fudge ups with some visual effects, overall, I feel like this anime had some of the best animation I've ever seen.

I think this sort of fluid animation can be seen best in the fight with Elsa. The magical effects actually looked real. When Emilia and Puck were shooting ice spikes at Elsa like fireworks at a festival, they looked like actual spears of ice being hurtled towards a target, and when they struck something, they actually created a freezing effect along the ground. Incidentally, this freezing effect was used to trap Elsa's foot.

My favorite part of this battle was actually when Rienhard appeared. I really loved how they made Elsa jump around and run along the walls. The way the animators blurred and stretched her body to make it look like she was moving at super human speeds was an interesting visual choice, and when we were given a first-person perspective of her crawling along the walls like a spider monkey, it was creepy as fuck.

Outside of the visuals, another key factor that I feel increased the aesthetic appeal of this anime was the music and how the directors used it. I'm not going to talk about the opening and ending themes yet, since I'll probably do those in a separate video. Instead, I'm going to talk about how this anime used music during its scenes to enhance the emotions that the director wanted you to feel.

This anime is filled to the brim with a number of interesting instrumental songs. Going back to the episode where Subaru fights Elsa, the episode starts off with an almost off-time tune that enhances the increases the tension between Emilia, Subaru, Rom, and Felt when they're having a stand off. As the stand off continues, more instruments join the music to thicken that feeling of the scene reaching a potentially fatal conclusion. However, the tension soon fades when Subaru spots the flower on Emilia's clothing, which was given to her by the girl they had rescued together in a previous timeline. The music fades at just the right time. A mere instant after the music dies, Subaru spots Elsa getting ready to attack Emilia.

The best example of how this anime used music was during the more psychologically damaging moments. I feel like the greatest example is in episode 18. Subaru wakes up after barely surviving against the White Wale. The music that's playing is an electric piano, and the tune has a melancholy feel, which contrasts with Ram's casual demeanor. However, this only serves to enhance Subaru's emotional distress, which you can see in his face. At one point, the instruments shift to what I believe is a violin orchestra, though don't quote me on that. At this point, Subaru tells Ram that Rem is dead and wallows in his own helplessness. At that moment, Ram asks Subaru, “Who is Rem.” The abrupt ceasing of music that happens here is almost jarring, and it really gives you this feeling where you can't help but wonder what's going on. This is especially true because the music starts a few seconds after this question, but the tone is different, darker, and it accompanies Subaru's increasingly desperate voice.


Natsuki Subaru -The Hero You Never Asked For-

Natsuki Subaru is the titular character of RE:Zero Starting Life in Another World, and he's one of those character who's very existence has sparked much debate within the anime community. Some people love him, claiming that he's realistic, while others hate him, perhaps for that very same reason.

I don't think there's any denying that Natsuki Subaru is a great character. The fact that he sparks so much debate among fans proves that. But what makes him work as a character that gets so much attention? Why does he, out of all the tracksuit wearing Otaku who've been sent to another world, receive such high praise and loathing in equal amounts?

Taking a look at the very start of the series, we immediately get a feel for what kind of person Subaru is. We watch him as he lazily, slothfully, reads a manga at a convenience store. We watch as his empty eyes flicker across the page and he mumbles to himself. Taking a look at him here, in his natural element, I feel like we have a clear view of Natsuki Subaru and what kind of person he is. What stood out the most to me during this sequence was how empty he seems. It's not the same emptiness as most light novel protagonists, who are no more than blank slates that are used as self-insert characters. He feels more like a soul who simply has nothing going for him, which is the general outlook that most Japanese people have of Otakus.

When Subaru is suddenly transported to another world, he instantly recognizes what happened. Rather than panic, as would be the natural response of most people, Subaru seems excited. This is shown in his cringe worthy dialogue and over the top actions. He's not freaked out in the least. In fact, he seems to think of this as his chance to shine as “the main protagonist.”

I've heard a lot of debate on the subject of Subaru's reaction, or lack there of, as some people have described it. Some people feel like Subaru's reaction was unrealistic because he didn't panic enough. However, I actually think Subaru's reaction is exactly what we should expect from someone like him. While it's not shown, from his general appearance, demeanor, and attitude, it's easy to see that Subaru is the kind of person who stayed at home watching anime and playing video games all day, only going out when he needed to buy something.

In many ways, Subaru is the by-product of the media that he's consumed. What's more, there are numerous isekai anime out there, which I feel lends credence to Subaru's reaction to his new predicament. He's consumed so much of this media where regular Otaku's are sent to another world that not only does he realize what's happened, but he's become disillusioned enough to believe that being sent to another world somehow makes him special, that he's become one of the chosen few, and that he was sent here for a reason, and that this reason is because he's going to be the hero of this world. What makes his actions more believable is how Otaku view themselves.

Everyone wants to be special. However, I feel like Otakus take this to another level. This is why so many anime that pander to Otakus feature tropes like overpowered main characters and harems. They're designed to empower and glorify Otaku culture.

What makes Subaru different is that his existence doesn't glorify Otaku culture. Everything this guy does throughout the series is cringe worthy. Near the beginning, he spouts atrocious and arrogant lines that made me want to slam my face into a wall, because a facepalm wouldn't be enough to deal with the cringiness. In some ways, in many ways, Natsuki Subaru is the exact opposite of a traditional light novel protagonist. Instead of glorifying Otaku culture, he does the opposite by showing all of the worst traits that are often associated with Otaku. It's sort of like staring into a mirror and only seeing the things about yourself that you hate the most.

Despite how cringe-inducing Subaru is, he does have some outstanding qualities, such as his desire and determination to help Emilia during the first arc. Even though his lines still made me facepalm, I really admired his determination and willingness to help, even though it was obvious that he was still afraid of Elsa. The fact that, in the end, he not only succeeded but also saved Emilia's life when Elsa tried to kill her with a surprise attack, has a much greater impact because it's something that I honestly didn't think he could do, unlike most light novel protagonists who only struggle when the plot demands it.

During the next arc, we see more of Subaru and his ridiculously meta dialogue and poorly veiled anime references. By this point, I actually felt like his dialogue was kind of charming. I thought his attempts at wooing Emilia, who doesn't even seem to realize that Subaru is completely crushing on her, were cute. It helps that he and Puck got along great. Puck's added cuteness does an amazing job of softening Subaru's thuggish appearance and terrible lines.

I almost feel like this arc served as a method of buffing Subaru's character up while also slowly breaking him down. In the beginning, Subaru works really hard to be useful and spends a lot of time with Emilia, even convincing her to go on a date with him. Then he dies. He goes to sleep and wakes up the next morning in the bed that he first woke up in, a bed that he hadn't slept in since the beginning of the arc, and the scars on his hands, which he gained from cutting himself while learning to cook, are all gone.

Subaru's emotional paradigm slowly shifts from light hearted to darker. At first he tries to do everything over again, going under the assumption that he can figure out what killed him if he retraces his steps. This doesn't actually help, though. On the fifth day, the day where he was killed last time, Subaru decides to stay up all night and ends up suffering instead of just dying in his sleep. First, he's hit by some kind of strange nausea, which we later learn was caused by a curse. Then, when he leaves his room to seek help, he is brutally attacked and murdered by someone, though he never saw who.

After this, Subaru decides to confront his attacker. This is the point where Subaru breaks. When he's killed and his life resets from his previous “save point”, Subaru decides that he doesn't want to be near anyone. He withdraws into himself and doesn't bother with all of the actions he took previously. He shuts himself away, convincing Beatrice to protect him. As a result of his actions, Rem is killed in his place, which makes Subaru realize that the person who cursed him wasn't Rem or Ram. Of course, at this stage, none of that matters because Subaru already irreversibly screwed up this time line.

Subaru undergoes another shift during this episode. At the end, he kills himself to reset time by willingly leaping off a cliff. I'm not sure if this is stupidity or what, but since he has his Return by Death ability, I can't argue with the results. Subaru returns back to his previous save point and decides that the first thing he needs to do is win the trust of his new companions. We then watch a desperate Subaru as he struggles to earn Rem and Ram's trust. I can practically feel his desperation during this time. The way he ramped up his cringe-y Otakuness in a vain effort to endear himself to them was so well-done. It contrasted with the “thought speaking” that we hear the longer this went on. It wasn't until Emilia, who was already pretty worried when she sees how he's acting, allows him to release all of his pent up frustration and sorrow.

This is the turning point in the arc, because the next few episodes are basically Subaru overcoming all of the obstacles that were presented to him. Thanks to Emilia, he earned Rem's trust, which enables him to find out what had cursed him. Then he earns Rem's affection by saving her in the last arc of this season.

All's well that ends well, right?

Wrong.

In most anime, this would be the point where Subaru becomes the hero that everyone wishes they could be. Instead, Subaru takes a different turn, a more realistic turn. He becomes arrogant. It's no surprise. After facing off against such hardships, overcoming such hurdles, any normal person would become drunk off their own sense of self-importance. In some ways, this arrogance is deserved. However, Subaru shows us the worst and ugliest side of humanity's arrogance during the next arc, and it's here where I feel Re:Zero differentiates itself from other anime of the isekai genre.

This arc introduces a new problem to the anime. We've already learned from Roswaal that Emilia is one of several candidates who are next in line for the throne. Subaru travels with Emilia under the pretense of thanking the people who helped him when he first arrived in Lugnica and having his magic gate, which he damaged during his fight with the Mabeast, healed.

We can see at the beginning how Subaru's arrogance has gotten the better of him when Julius kisses Emilia on the hand and he responds with jealousy. However, it's not until Subaru muscles his way into the meeting where all of the king candidates are that we can see how low he's fallen. This fact is further emphasized when he accepts Julius challenge and gets his ass handed to him, and now comes the clincher. After being beaten by Julius, he is confronted by Emilia. Before this, he had actually made several promises to Emilia: He would not do anything reckless and he would wait at the inn with Rem. When Emilia asks Subaru why he decided to fight Julius, his answer is that he did it all for her, because she saved him and he's repaying her.

The problem here is that Emilia doesn't remember saving him. The timeline in which Emilia rescued Subaru is already gone. The only one who remembers what happened is Subaru. Frustrated, drowning in self-importance and arrogance, Subaru goes off on Emilia, claiming that he's done so much for her, that she should be more grateful, that she should be indebted to him. Emilia agrees that she owes him a lot and decides to end things here.

What we see after this is Subaru going through a downward spiral of denial and despair. Each episode becomes more and more hopeless as the tragedies that he faces escalates. Halfway through this arc, Subaru's mind even breaks and he becomes a vegetable. And just when you thought Subaru could not get any lower, he surprises you by showing us just how scumy he can be. I feel like this arc is showing us how low humans can become when they're back is against the wall. All of Subaru's faults are thrown into his face by the king candidates who he tries to make help him. It isn't until episode 17, when Subaru confronts Emilia after miraculously making it to the Roswaal estate, that he realizes just how little he can do, and it's not until episode 18, when he is killed by Pack after killing Emilia, that he realizes how little everyone else expects out of him.

After being killed by Pack, Subaru is forced to confront all of the things that he ignored: his weakness, his inability to do anything, the fact that no one expected anything from him, and his own self-loating. I feel like this episode represents both the lowest and highest points of Subaru's evolution here. After having failed numerous times to become the main hero that he feels his owed to him in this world, he tries to convince Rem to run away with him. What makes this point so low is because Subaru doesn't love Rem. He loves Emilia. However, he's trying to convince Rem, a girl he doesn't love, to runaway with him as a consolation prize. Rem realizes this, of course, which is why she convinces him not to run away, but I'll get to that when I talk about Rem in another video.

I've mentioned this before, but in a lot of ways, Subaru is the kind of otaku/nerd that many of us don't want to be. Having watched many light novel anime in my time, I wasn't used to seeing a character like Subaru, who isn't the glorified otaku protagonist that's special from episode 1. And as much as I loved seeing Subaru when he actually succeeds when everyone expected him to fail, I loved seeing him when he realized that he was nothing even more. In some ways, I feel like Subaru is less of a protagonist and more like an non playable character from a video game who suddenly became the main protagonist. He oftentimes finds himself in over his head, but he pushes through and succeeds even while he's annoying the crap out of everyone around him with his genre-savvy awareness and self-importance. It's these massive flaws mixed in with the few good traits that shine through that make Subaru one of the best and worst characters that I've ever seen. He is, in many ways, the hero that you never asked for.


Emilia -Silver-haired Half-elf Heroines-

Emilia is the main heroine and love interest of Natsuki Subaru, and I don't think anyone can deny her visual appeal. From her silver hair and purple eyes, to her outstanding dress, Emilia stands out among heroines in terms of how aesthetically pleasing she is. But beneath the surface of her pretty face and pointy ears lies the real reason she's the main heroine of Re:Zero.

True to her role as the main heroine, Emilia embodies many of the traits that a lot of people find appealing. She's kind to everyone she meets, she goes out of her way to help people even when doing so wouldn't benefit her, and she has a forgiving attitude that makes her extremely likable. She's also socially awkward, has trouble expressing her feelings, and is incredibly naive, which makes her really cute. I feel like her very concept was made to epitomize the traits that people consider to be “main heroine” traits. In some ways, I actually feel like Emilia is more of a main character than Subaru, despite how this anime is about Subaru.

I'd like you all to imagine what this world would be like if Subaru never showed up. If no otaku from another world suddenly appeared in Lugnica, what do you think this anime would be about? Chances are it would be about Emilia. The reason is because of the lofty goals, position, and expectations that have been placed on her within the series. We learn from Roswaal in episode 5 that Emilia is one of several candidates for the throne of Lugnica. During the time when Subaru is learning how to be a good servant, we're given occasional glimpses of what Emilia is doing. The times when we see her sitting behind a desk, writing on something or reading something, are placed in here to reveal that she's learning how to become a proper ruler. If Subaru had never entered the picture, I'm positive that this story would have been about Emilia as she tries to ascend the throne.

But while this is certainly a lofty goal worthy of a main character, it's not everything that makes Emilia who she is, or what makes her shine despite getting so little screen time. Throughout the series we're given tiny glimpse of her personality. Whenever she's with Subaru and he's acting goofy, Emilia shows us a socially awkward side of her that, at first glance, seems like nothing more than a cute quirk. It isn't until much later that we learn that her inability to sometimes comprehend others or take their words at face value is because of a much darker reason.

One of the scenes I would like to highlight for you all is just before Subaru dies for the first time after coming to Roswaal's mansion. Subaru is telling Emilia about all the fun things he's been doing, and how he went into the village that day and had to deal with all the kids and a dog biting him. He asks Emilia if she wants to go with him, but Emilia turns her head. She states that “it's not that she doesn't want to go with him, but that she might cause trouble.”

This sort of scene continues throughout this arc. It doesn't seem like much at first. However, we were previously given a hint as to why she's so reticent to travel into the village with Subaru. It's at the end of part 2 episode 1 and the beginning of episode 2. In part 1 of the first episode, Emilia tells Subaru that her name is Satella, so naturally, Subaru calls her that when he catches up to her at the end of part 2. However, the time line from before has vanished, and so Emilia never gave him that name. He's shocked when she gets angry, but then she tells him not to call her by the name of the “jealous witch”. We learn later on that the “witch” is referring to a woman named Satella, who is one of the most feared and hated people in Lugnica's history. In episode 4, when Emilia confronts Subaru, Felt, and Rom, Felt is startled when she learns that Emilia is a half-elf. Her words in that episode point to another fact: Emilia looks exactly like Satella.

If there's one thing that's popular among shounen anime, it's that we love to see our heroes as the “underdog”. There's nothing greater than watching someone who is supposed to be weaker suddenly triumph. There's a reason anime like Naruto, and more recently, My Hero Academy, are so popular. Oddly enough, Emilia embodies this shounen trait more than Subaru does. For her entire life, she's had to live with the hatred that comes from being not only a half elf, but someone who resembles the most hated person in history. When looking at her during the meeting where they introduce the king candidates, we can see that she's the underdog. No one wants her to win. In fact, I'm pretty sure that many of these people would be happier if she dropped dead.

This is what makes her such an appealing main heroine. While Emilia is never given a whole lot of screen time, the bit of screen time that she's given is irreplaceable and does an excellent job of slowly revealing more about her and the hardships she has to face.

I think it's because she's had to constantly deal with the hatred of others that she comes to appreciate Subaru, and it is also what ultimately helped drive a wedge between them. During the last scene of episode 13, when Subaru tries to justify how he broke his promise to her, Emilia tells him that she thought he was going to be different, that he would treat her the same way he treats everyone else. I could almost feel Emilia's heart shattering with those words. When someone has been scorned their whole life, the only thing they want is to be treated the same as everyone else, especially if the circumstances for that scorn are beyond their control. However, it's this moment that reveals something else about Emilia's character.

Throughout this entire moment, I feel like everything Emilia did was for Subaru's sake instead of her own. Subaru kept pushing himself because of her, kept getting injured because of her. In the end, she decided that it would be better if she cut ties with him. If they were no longer associated with each other, then maybe Subaru would stop hurting himself for her sake. Of course, it's not as if Emilia is perfect. I'm sure that a part of her reason for pushing Subaru away was for her own sake. It's not easy seeing someone push themselves so hard for you when you can't understand why. At the same time, I feel like Emilia's kindness is almost at the level of a martyr, which partly caused by the fact that Emilia doesn't believe she deserves to be happy.

These two facts, the fact that Emilia is more concerned about Subaru than herself, and the fact that she doesn't believe she deserves happiness, are expanded upon later on. When Subaru returns to the Roswaal estate and tries to convince Emilia to leave with him, she doesn't understand and therefore won't go with him. Subaru then goes off on a rant. When he finishes, rather than getting upset, Emilia asks “Why are you crying, as if you're in such pain?” This tells me that she realizes Subaru is suffering, even if she doesn't understand why. Rather than just assuming that he was yelling at her, she recognizes that the person he was yelling at was, in reality, himself. That he was telling himself that nothing he did would make a difference. What makes this moment so impactful is how, even though Emilia is stressed from being a kind candidate, she still shows concern for Subaru.

One of the few things I didn't like about this series was how little screen time Emilia received. I would've liked to see more of what she was doing while Subaru was being traumatized and suffering. That said, the few glimpses we're given are enough for me to confirm that she's also been suffering in her own way. During the time where Subaru is gone, Emilia spends her days alone in the mansion or trying to convince the villagers that it's not safe and they should come up to her mansion where they will be protected. The villages scorn and refusal to listen, combined with the fact that Subaru is no longer there to keep her company, leaves Emilia depressed. For those of you who've watched the closing theme song of the second half, you'll see what I'm talking about. During the closing theme, we're shown a cartoonish version of what Emilia's life was like after cutting ties with Subaru. Later on, we're also given flashbacks that show the villagers turning her away when she tries to rescue them.

Of course, there is also the fact that everytime Subaru came to the mansion during episodes 14, 15, and 16, Emilia has been killed by a cult that wants her dead. Even if we didn't see her death, it's easy to realize that she likely suffered a great deal before dying.

The final point I'd like to make in this segment is how Emilia is a badass. We don't see this very often because she only fights twice, once against Elsa and once more when the Witch's Cult attacks, but she's actually pretty freaking strong. Sure, she's got Pack on her side, but Puck actually didn't do much outside of the beginning fights with Elsa, and he only gave Emilia a little bit of aid when she fought against one of Betelguease's fingers.

Whether you like Emilia or not, I don't think there are many people who will deny that she has all the makings of a main character.


Rem -The Maid Every Man Wants-

One of the greatest surprises in Re:Zero, for me at least, was the sudden popularity with Rem. Granted, it's not hard to understand why she became so popular, but when she was first introduced, Rem didn't have much of a presence. In fact, Ram had a lot more screen time than Rem did. It wasn't even until episode 7, where we learn that Rem was the mysterious person who killed Subaru in a previous episode, that she really rises to prominence.

To see why Rem is so popular, I believe the first thing we need to look at is just what Rem is. She's a maid. This might not seem like a good reason, but maids have become an exceedingly popular aspect of otaku culture, not just in Japan, but in the US as well. Maid cafes started to really explode in Japan during the early 2000s, and since then, the appeal of maids has gotten to the point where there are now several maid cafes in the United States.

What makes maids such a huge hit among fans depends on who it is. For women, I believe it's the cute outfit. Let's face it, the frills and fluff on a maid uniform is pretty darn adorable. There's a reason maid's symbolize Japan's love for moe. For the man, it's because maid's represent the ideal woman. They're supportive, they're loyal, and they're subservient. A maid basically lives for her master or mistress, and after Subaru saves her life in episode 11, Rem becomes what many men consider to be the ideal maid.

Another thing that must be considered is how much we learned about Rem during the last half of the second arc. Rem has a tragic backstory that appeals to people. It pulls at their heart strings and makes you want to root for her. I think the fact that she was originally seen as the lesser of the two sisters made her feel a bit more flawed. She wasn't this perfect maid right from the start, she didn't have this impeccable talent. She cultivated it after her village was burned down and her sister lost her horn.

In some ways, Rem becoming such a perfect maid was done in repentance for what happened to her sister. She believes it's her fault that Ram lost her horn and therefore her powers. To make up for this, she has strive to become as perfect as possible. I don't know if I could call this a form of self-punishment, but I can say that she's definitely beating herself up over this.

Of course, this actually brings up another point of appeal for Rem. She's a demon, and what's better than a cute demon maid who kicks ass? Rem not only has the maid appeal that everyone loves for one reason or another, but she's also really strong. Just watching as she demolished those mabeasts during episodes 10 and 11 was incredible. Seriously. What's not to like about a maid who can toss around a spiked ball and chain like it was a chew toy?

Beyond her general appeal, I feel what really made her so loved was how much screen time she got. Going through the anime after Subaru rescues her, it's easy to see that Rem is in almost every scene that Subaru is in. You always see her. Even when she's not the focal point of that particular scene, she's there in the background, as though her role was the silently support Subaru. This point about her supporting Subaru is also made clear during the many scenes in which Rem expresses her belief that Subaru is special. During the time when Subaru's mind had broken after seeing the villagers near the Roswaal manner slaughtered, Crusch asked Rem why she would give her life for a man like Subaru, and Rem's answer was “Because he is special.”

And that's probably the greatest appeal to Rem. At a time where Subaru was sinking into despair, Rem was the one holding him up. People like it when they have others support them. It's a part of human nature. Therefore, it's only natural that people would flock to Rem, who's willing to support Subaru regardless of the personal cost to herself. Her devotion towards Subaru is second to none. She literally gives her life for him several times throughout this series.

The most stunning example of Rem's devotion is shown during the same seen that probably caused a number of viewers to drop the series. It's during the time when Subaru tries to convince Rem to run away with him. Rem looks really happy that he would ask her this, but at the same time, she at the same time, I feel like she knows that Subaru wouldn't be happy because he's abandoning what made him seem so strong to her in the first place. Ultimately, it was her support that made him choose to stick around. Of course, it was Subaru's statement about loving Emilia that had many US Rem fans up in arms, but I'm not going to get into that.

It shouldn't come as a surprise. Rem's devotion has made her number 1 in the hearts of many—even if she still isn't number 1 in Subaru's heart."

I was preparing to be disappointed since I was hearing good things from random people I didn't know, rather than my friends. However, I got a very pleasant surprise when I started watching it.

Immediately you're thrown into a unique plot with great characters that makes you think a lot. It's extremely impressive how suspenseful even the first episode is, as well as each episode after that. The way the story is written and characters are developed was at a level I rarely
                  ...
ever get to see. Nearly every episode ends at a cliffhanger that just begs you to watch the next episode immediately. Usually I can bear the wait for an anime's next season, but this time I absolutely can't wait for the story to start up again.

Overall, I can say without question that this is one of the best, possibly even THE best anime I've ever seen. This is a must watch, and anyone who doesn't watch this is really missing out big time."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=4,Recommended,"And so we are finally at the finish line… [A sort of review of Re:Zero]

And so it has finally ended…
To be honest, I think 25 episodes was just the right amount. On one hand, one cour would not have been enough to really capture the story. Arc 3 was instrumental in showcasing that the novel does have world building and the story is much more grand than the first two arcs might have one believe. If we had finished on arc 2, it would have looked like the story was entirely focused only on Subaru, his suffering and that the rest of the world doesn’t
                  ...
really exist.
It got to a point where I was theorizing that the entire world of the show was just a product of Subaru’s mind. That nothing was real and it was all in his head. If there was no arc 3, I would have really believed this to be the case, but now it’s clear that the world of Re:Zero is, without a doubt, alive and full of storylines.
On the other hand, if we had more episodes, I feel like the show would start to get stale. The thing with Re:Zero is that, whilst the writing is REALLY good, it’s still fairly simplistic. It gives me very strong Kawahara vibes (author of SAO) in that he is an extremely skilled writer, but is creating a product for the general public to consume, not avid readers. It’s like a gourmet pizza. It’s gourmet alright, but it’s still just a pizza.
So if we had another cour or two, I feel like the hype of the show would start to go down towards the end. People would start to get slightly bored.
And so 25 episodes is just the right amount to perfectly get across what Re:Zero is and to hook people to go and read the light novels. Luckily, with all this hype around, a lot of people have taken up to translate so I expect many volumes to be done in a very short amount of time.
The people who REALLY got invested in the idea of Re:Zero, will now have an excellent LN to pick up, while anime fans will be able to end this show with a good impression.
It reminds me of Spice&Wolf, actually. Funnily enough, done by the same studio, that show also ended on a very good note to hook the viewer to try the LN without getting even slightly stale.
So with that said, on to some reviewing!
The best way I could describe this show, is a very, VERY long movie. Each arc felt VERY much like a separate movie with way more content than a movie would normally have.
The thing with most LNs and anime shows in general is that they’re made to have a slow plot progression. After every big plot checkmark, there will be a fairly long period of “settling down” on the new “level” within the story. There will always be a lot of time spent on increasing the depth of the characters or on building the world. These moments where any events that happen don’t really “mean” anything. They’re just there to help us develop our understanding and view of the characters.
I think Re:Zero is exactly about this concept and approaching it in an entirely different way.
It’s a show where character and world building happen while having huge plot developments and then using “Return by death” to reset said plot development, but keep our new understanding of the characters valid.
It’s pretty ingenious and VERY different from everything else that dealt with similar mechanics. 
It’s how I always envisioned time travel stories to play out. Using different timelines as a means to learn something to then use in the original timeline.
This parallel of an MC that is constantly changing due to the events that surround him and the cast that change only based on the events of the one timeline they’re in. The fact that towards the end of the show, White Fox managed to really make these characters feel “alive” is proof of their extreme competence as a studio and the brilliance of the author.

Another point that must not be missed is how this show managed to go so mainstream, while taking so many story risks. By this I mean that the story itself was not filled with fanservice and over-positive outcomes towards the main cast like in most other light novels. One of the greatest issues with a lot of current light novels that deal with world-transportation is that the MC ends up being invincible from the very start. There is always huge risk involved, but the MC always ends up winning and never suffers even a little bit.
Re:Zero throws this entire concept out of the window and tries to tell a realistic and gritty tale. A tale of what being stuck in another world could really mean. The constant helplessness, powerlessness and the feel of isolation. All these emotions are VERY difficult to stomach for a viewer and are generally avoided by these young new LN authors and anime studios. They try to tell a story which the viewer could self-insert into and feel better about themselves fantasizing about it.
Self-inserting in this context is really a plague of extremely boring and WORTHLESS story-telling where the viewer doesn’t learn anything. It’s just like watching fireworks. They look cool, sure, but do they have any value apart from looking cool? Almost none.
Good storytelling is managing to play with the viewers emotions, making him care for the characters within the story and to learn something along the way.
Re:Zero does this job perfectly. It’s taking the concept of “stuck in another world” and creating a story WORTH TELLING. A story that exists not just to make money, but to actually have artistic value in itself.
The word is really artistic value. Can anyone really say that the majority of these recent trope stories have any artistic value? That they make a person really think about things and feel more emotions than what a drug would give? 
Re:Zero is a slap to the face of this type of worthless storytelling. A wake up call for authors that it IS possible in this day and age to attract an audience towards a story that is not glorious, but actually gritty, brutal and can make the viewer feel sick to the bone.
I genuinely dropped the show for a while when Arc3 started because the pitifulness of Subaru felt like too much. I couldn’t handle watching him completely lose his sense of reality in front of everyone. It was a horrible experience.
However, I never, not even for a moment, think that I’m dropping this show because it’s bad. I did it because it was so good at showcasing something so horrid. I just wanted to wait till enough episodes came out to actually reach a conclusion and not be stuck on such a pitiful state. I basically binged the remaining 10 episodes in 2 sessions of 5 episodes each. 5 weeks apart.
Now, here’s the big question : is Re:Zero really that good?
No, It’s really not a masterpiece. As brave as this show was, it still let itself be restrained by the genre. It simply wasn’t a multi-layered show. It had the core ideas presented from the start of the show, but didn’t attempt to explore any concepts TOO brave, nor did the show feature very strong multi-layered personalities. They still felt like characters from a fantasy work and not people that one could write essay after essay about.
Re:Zero just wasn’t attempting to express ideas that people could talk about for years in the future.
The parallel to draw here would be shows like NGE, which manages to talk about real world problems at length  and make people really THINK about the problems surrounding our society. 
Re:Zero does not attempt to make use pose such questions. It simply has a tale it wants to tell. This means that, whilst within it’s own boundry, the show is absolutely amazing. The boundry itself is too small to really reach the epitome of what an anime or a story in general can be capable of.
I will rate the show a 9 out of 10, with the distribution being:
Adaptation quality : 10/10. White Fox keeps proving itself as one of, if not the greatest studio when it comes to really capturing a source material.	
Story : 10/10. A brilliant tale that felt like a movie from start to finish. At no point in time did it feel boring or slow. Everything had a meaning.
Characters : 9/10. Subaru will go down in history as one of the most realistic MCs we’ve had in anime in a long time. The rest of the cast have also shown a high level of complexity. However, the show didn’t have anyone of the level of truly masterful characters (ex Holo, Shinji).
Realization of it’s purpose: 10/10. The author had very clear ideas that he wanted to get across with this story and he did it flawlessly. 
At the end of the day, the purpose itself of the show just wasn’t grand enough to warrant a masterpiece status so a 9 is as high as I would go. 
Re:Zero should go down in history as a new addition to the “must watch” lists to NEW anime fans and viewers who want to really see the “stuck in another world” genre expressed in a truly artistic way with actual value.
It’s not a deconstruction of a genre, but it’s definitely a very valuable work that shows where the genre can be taken.
Now if a writer were to take this entire genre and the groundwork that Re:Zero has laid and then attempted to break the 4th wall of the genre (actually connecting the fantasy world with the real world). Making the story not about an MC who is basically an immigrant from reality, but a story about taking shelter in the fantasy world to escape the real world or to use it as a means to better himself, then we could find ourselves a masterpiece.
If we could just have a writer as competent as Tappei Nagatsuki(Re:Zero) write a story based on the ideas of Reki Kawahara(SAO) with the writing prowess of someone like Nisio Isin(Monogatari) then we could really see this genre taken to the absolute limit."

Now honestly I could very well be biased as I write this but, It just appears to me that people's reasons to dislike this series tend to be redundant. Unnecessary plot progression is the reason some of you have the attention span of a monkey on drugs...Some don't even comprehend using death as a plot device for character development and proceeds to dismiss it as ""groundhog day"". Now look i'm not bashing anyone's opinion, if anything I encourage people to be vocal about their opinion's. However I feel as though people are rating this series
                  ...
poorly mainly cause it was hyped up to a point where it didn't reach their expectations...

RANT OVER CONTINUE HERE

So after that rant let's get down to why you're really here. Re:Zero is proclaimed by many to be the best of it's season and even the best of the year. Re:Zero has also taken one of my spots of favorite anime. And I'm gonna give you a few reasons as to why that is.

Story(10)
The story is very simple and it's even been done before. A normal shut-in boy who is transported from his normal world to a fantasy like world. He is then given the power to return by death. A main complaint is there isn't much explanation to why he was transported there, or what his purpose for being there is. However I think that adds to the mystery and allows you to theory craft. This is why I believe people who want answers right away have the attention span of a monkey...
The story like i said isn't all that new, however it has a presentation that feels fresh. The execution makes you feel for the MC as he goes on his journey. It makes you think about how you would handle his situation, if you were in his shoes.

Art(10)
Now Re:Zero has an impressive Production value. The lighting, the art, and the sound animation come together to produce some of the most beautiful scenes this year. 

Sound(9)
The music served its purposed, however it does tend to go unnoticable...When the openings and endings did play they were great overall. Pleasant to the ear and matched the overall tone they were trying to achieve.

Character(10)
The MC is helpless, he's weak, he grows attached easily, he's flawed, and most of all he's developed. He grows as a character, something that series don't seem to know how to do. The way this Light Novel adaptation shits on its predecessors when it comes to the characters, amuses me. 
Natsuki Subaru: This man was put through the ringer, I'll tell you that much. Half the time he's trying not to die but once he made bonds with others, he attempts to keep those around him from dying.

Emilia: The heroine of the series (you'd hardly think that around episodes 13-20). Emilia is the first character that truly interacts with Subaru(Duh she's the heroine xD). She's a half elf that is discriminated against because of the Jealous witch named Satella(I will get to her in a sec). Emilia is a character that was overshadowed by another character that more screen: Rem

Rem: Rem was ""waifu material"" around episodes 15-20 then she took her leave after all the screen time she was given...Everything that she has done for Subaru will be set in stone and go on to cement her place as best female character of the year

Satella: Satella is the end game villain and it's very apparent that she is the reason for the MC being in this world in the first place. She has been mentioned in almost all the episodes atleast once. The subtle foreshadowing is also hard not to mention...We can only hope to see who Satella is and what her purpose is...

That's only if we receive a season 2

Enjoyment(10)
For me this series is going to be hard to beat. It really took thriller to a new level and at the end had me wishing for a season 2. The writing was above average, and as an adaptation it passes with flying colors. Objectively speaking this series is sound...Imo it's the best this year. As you can see by my rating I wrote purely out of my opinion xD  

Overall(10)
This series has become one of my favorites of all time...and I hope for a season 2 soon

This anime is just amazing. It features a very unique protagonist that in my opinion is way more realistic than most. The characters in the series each have their own zing and the ships/fights/sad moments hit really good and hard.

Every episode had me clenched to my seat the entire time. The joy of a new episode coming out after the dreadful week-long wait was amazing.

have ever seen, and i have watched animes for over 7 years. Like there is so much covered in this story that is impossible for me to think of it all right here right now. It has romance, cute scenes, not the stupid reactions of the male's side that is so common. You even have some complex love stuff, humour (but not the stupid jokes we have seen 1000x times but actual fun stuff) and many more! You can see the main has real love for real, and is a guy who chooses even to give up! Like thats not something you see in animes, you mostly see that the character has his no-give up believe from where he gets all his power... I dont say its a bad thing, but I have seen it wayy too much. To be honest i cant believe there is a 3 point review on the top. Thats like... cmon, that anime deserves 10/10 just because Betelgeuse!

Art? Well I dont think i need to explain. You just gotta see. The fight scenes, the sad scenes, its all beautiful and FABULOUS! The crazy and psycho scenes are also really well made! Just 10/10. 

Sound? About the sound... its not an exception. Like many other masterpieces, the sound connects with the plot and the characters so well and so good... Sometimes I dont even hear the sound. It connects that good, that you dont actually realise its there, you can experience the show fully. I believe the sound is like a huge part of an anime, and it can bring down the best stories. This one is of the good ones tho. 

Characters... Here I can basically write so much. It has love, it has hatred, it has all those natural human emotions you rarely see in animes... like shame and self hatred. To be honest this 3* review frustrated me... Like cmon, this guy watched for real a lot of tsunderes animes and is mixing up stuff. Rem is not even flat chested. We just have Emilia who is someone used to hatred and disrespect, so she is shocked when someone loves her. Although here you have none of the annoying blush ups and half kisses. Subaro is one of the best characters, he is down, then up again and then down again. Its really good one, and you dont see him believing in himself from the begining. You can actually see him changing in good and bad ways. To be honest I could describe everything with LOVE. This anime makes my brain TREMBLE!

Enjoyment - Made my brain tremble, and is still trembling!

Overall - 11/10. For real. If you are still reading and havent opened new tab searching for horrible subs or other place to watch it, what are you doing? Dont need to respect me for my review, go watch it and thank me later. DONT, i repear DONT listein this guy who rated it 3/10. This guy is crazy. He supposedly watched the anime in 2x. But hey, there is the saying that a negative person can find the best and purest love being rotten shit. So... if you are not a total pessimist, laden by life... dont watch it. Well actually, you can watch it, because SURPRISE SURPRISE you can find yourself in Subaru. 

PS: If you find something bad in the anime, and focus on it, and not on the overflowing masterpieceness, damn, why are you even watching animes? You wont like any of them."

It kills you, you kills yourself with it, you kill other people with it, it kills everyone you love, it kills your hopes and dreams, I think I’m off topic. Re:Zero -Starting life in another world- is an anime about a protagonist named Natsuki Subaru who is randomly teleported into another world where his life is saved by a girl named Satella. This is directly followed up by his discovery that he has the ability to reset to certain points of time upon his death, and so he has to figure out his survival in the world. Throughout
                  ...
the show there is the constant discussion of themes of hopelessness, stress, and depression. Although there is a contrast in its themes of happiness, love, and care. Additionally to even that, there is a dynamic interplay between these two subject matters.The light and dark balance in Re:Zero is shown throughout the series effortlessly by director Masaharu Watanabe and studio White Fox. These themes can be shown through several characters from the shows huge and extremely well utilized cast, through its repeated use of contrast, and finally its use of allegory to express both darkness and light within the characters emotions.

First off, it helps to define light and dark. Re:Zero approaches the darkness of Subaru’s character by showing him as an emotional time bomb. Like anyone, he has a breaking point, and releases it all in vents and fits of destructive rage. The light in him though is his drive, and his direct passion towards what he does. What stands out most about Subaru, is he has a truly defined personality, and a dynamic character. Each interaction leading to a deeper connection with his inner character and the ones he’s communicating with. He breaks, and builds himself back up again. This balance of light and dark character is very well linked to the first emotion I’d like to discuss.

Despair is a common theme throughout the show, although it may be more fitting to say depression and the general despair that comes along with it. Subaru is very deep rooted in apathy, and repressive of his emotions. This show does a great job of pacing his growth, and not giving the protagonist what he wants. It repeatedly kills him (literally) and each time you hate to see him die. The director expertly frames and times shots to make viewers feel each and every gnawing bite of the deaths. The feeling of going back to where you started and suffering so much along the way, makes the pay off so much more worth it. The show constantly keeps viewers on their toes with it’s use of thriller elements, making viewers worry about what’s out of frame than what’s in. Overall, it’s a very western approach to directing and film craft, and demonstrates a great strength on studio White Fox’s part. Though, the writing is what makes this shine. 

(SPOILERS BEGIN)

In episode 18 of this show (From Zero) which is nearly entirely dedicated to the interactions between two of the shows main characters, Subaru and Rem. Rem is very representative of simple happiness. Something short term, tempting, and fleeting. Something easy. Rem is set up through some admittedly hamfisted symbolism with stories about demons and flower pots, but it sets up for a character that understands regret and that clinging onto short term happiness and cruelness. Something she does not want to see Subaru suffer through, so despite her love for Subaru, denies him, knowing that he will feel the same regret. The regret and guilt that she would not wish upon anyone. Rem’s character seems to be a popular love interest among the community, but he fundamental existence is to reject Subaru, and promote his love for someone else. Someone whose selfishness has ruined her, leading her to a life of selflessness\These events lead to Subaru approaching a lighter view on life. Approaching hope, and overcoming his apathy and denial and fear. It’s showing him finally grasping at true happiness.

Another theme this show entangles with is love. Love is something that is shown through the shows main villain, and through Subaru, both in wildly different ways. Betelgeuse is a character who approaches love as a sort of obsession, thinking of love as a reward for work. He makes it his life to wound and destroy himself for the sake of a single love. Something that would be easy to compare to with Subaru, a character who suffers repeatedly being gored, beaten, starved, betrayed, and frozen to death, for the sake of a single girl. The difference spurs from why they do it. Betelgeuse approaches his love for the witch (who looks identical to Subaru’s love interest, seriously I cannot defend the in your face symbolism in this show) as a need. Something he must complete, like it is his destiny. He takes the pain like a heartbeat. Though Subaru approaches the pain with his own will, and desire. Going back to Rem, she is an easy way out and he denies it. Subaru makes his choices to put himself in that position, and it is all for one reason that he completely dedicates his ability to one girl.

The last emotion is happiness. The shows finale, titled ‘that’s all this story is about’, which basically inspired me to write this. The end of the show is a dialogue between Subaru and his love interest, Satella/Emilia. Emilia is Subaru’s goal for the whole show, because in Emilia, Subaru’s character sees happiness. He struggles through despair and depression to approach that happiness, that end goal. Not the false and easy happiness that Rem offers, not the hopeless and overly dedicated happiness that Betelgeuse wants to achieve with the witch, but true loving happiness. The show is a love story, that’s all this story is about, but there is so much to a love story. No romance goes without despair, or test, or suffering. Sometimes you have to go back to the beginning and try again and again, throwing yourself at the same wall over and over until you find a way around. True happiness isn’t something you can give up on. That’s what this story is all about. 

(SPOILERS END)

Though, Re:Zero is not perfect. From a production standpoint, the animation is choppy at best. A gratuitous use of CGI is upsetting, especially from White Fox’s visual beauty that is Akame Ga Kill (Not calling Akame Ga Kill a good show, just a pretty one). CGI is good in moderation, something that this show does not know how to use. Additionally in the area of moderation, the hamfisted symbolism mentioned above is very overused. It has a tendency to treat its audience like idiots, several times making me roll my eyes. It is messy in that regard, and a little upsetting. Even more than that though, it’ll resort to genre tropes like cherry blossoms and doves to almost insult a viewer with any semblance of a brain. The show does a very good job avoiding the harem anime that it could so easily become, but doesn’t hide the fact that being a harem anime was definitely on the table (hence why it is getting a visual novel.) Lastly, even though it isn’t awful, only one or two pieces of the soundtrack stood out. There isn’t enough there to really make a huge difference.

Overall, Re:Zero -starting life in another world- confronts themes in a clever way that amy not be on evangelion levels of symbolism and shakespearean scale, but it does set itself apart from the currently lackluster anime mainstream. The only major complaint is its use of open plotlines, setting up for season 2. The show does stand on its own two feet, with the removal of some of the Felt plot line, shaving down the big fight in the later episodes (you know the one if you’ve watched it), and even cutting out some character development scenes, this show could easily be 6-10ish hours long, instead of the monstrous 14 hours it does not have to be. Additionally it would stand on it’s own. Though, if the author has a story to tell, I would love to hear it.

TL;DR

Story - 8/10, though some of the symbolism is shoved down your throat, it’s smart enough to more than carry its own weight in an oversaturated genre.

Characters - 9/10, with very few unmemorable characters and almost every member of the cast holding some emotional weight, it is hard to watch this show without falling in love with all of them.

Art - 4/10, White Fox pls

Sound - 6/10, above average. Some memorable songs.

Enjoyment - 10/10, Way too much fun, between the suspense, the heart, and the action, I think this may be the show to get me back into my almost two year hiatus from anime. This is mostly personal though..."

Re:Zero's flawless execution, lovably unique characters, beautiful art, and good soundtrack leaves very little to be desired as it captures your heart and takes you on a unique psychological fantasy adventure. This is an anime that has become one of the many outstanding gems of the Anime genre like common fantasy/psychological favorites like Code Geass, Madoka Magica, Katanagatari, Shinsekai Yori and I want to say SAO but people give that so much hate for no good reason.

Story:10/10
Suddenly summoned from this world to another world, what should you do? Subaru answers these questions using his broad, grand otaku knowledge. He gets ambushed by some typical thugs and gets saved by the beautiful half-elf protagonist, Emilia thus beginning his happy-happy, lovey dove, overpowered fantasy world story. Unfortunately for him, that's the opposite of what actually happens. In a fantastic twist, he's your thrown into a series of gut-opening horrific tragedies that earn this anime the right to call itself a psychological anime. In this fantasy world, Subaru has only one power: the power to return to a certain point in the past by dying. He tries desperately to be the story's hero, but like many fantasy games will teach you playing hero can cause you tons of... well... Damage---See what I did there? ;) ;) ;)--- Subaru has many difficult obstacles to overcome, they're so difficult to overcome that they can actually cost a guy his life! He meets a large variety of outstanding characters, all of whom have depth to their personalities; there are almost no typical characters in sight. Pacing is outstanding, I feel the pacing is designed to make you feel the desperation and agony of the main character where even small actions can be event changing (butterfly effect).

The comedy is absolutely fantastic. The progression of events has a major degree of realism to it, contrary to many anime out there. Honestly, everything about the story is outstanding enough that I could talk any the series' premise and plot progression is for several paragraphs without any spoilers 

Characters 10/10
Nearly every character is memorable and unique! That's extremely difficult to achieve and ice only seen a few anime succeed at it.

Just to go over a few:

Starting with Rem: I won't say too much but know that Rem is a truly fearsome character. She's skillful at performing maid tasks and un-trusting, but she's also loveable to the point where she has won the heart of most Re:Zero watchers. In contrast to her red haired twin sister Ram who's laid back and relaxed, but trusting and less lovable.

Subaru: What makes Subaru special is that there's nothing special about him and he's actually pretty immature and dumb. Like really dumb. He's just an average guy that's kind and wants his happy fantasy life and the happiness of the people. No special powers). No superhuman reflexes. He is just like me and you. He does his ""best"" despite being faced with so many tragic events which are quite honorable. He's also one of my least favorite characters in the series, but hey! Still unique!

Emilia, a lonely introverted loving half-elf that's been mistreated and ostracized by the general public due to their fears of the legend of the witch. 

Everybody in the mansion, the Knights, the villagers, the villains, the princesses, all of them are outstanding.

A certain bae-tleguese will even reach out to you with open arms!

You may get a new favorite character from this series! 

Art: 9/10
The art makes you feel with the characters, the animation is fluid the facial expressions are believable, everything is top notch quality. Some scenes will make you cringe. The only reason I can't call it a 10 is because of Fate Unlimited Bladeworks and other similar quality anime or unique styled anime like Katanagatari. Character designs are beautiful and interesting. There are funny speaking magic clown lords, maids, catgirls, cat traps, queen-like characters, tomboy lolis, bae-tlegueses, this series has it all!

Sound: 8/10
Unfortunately, the sound is the weakest aspect of the anime. The sounds are really good, don't get me wrong. But imagine if the music was as unique and memorable as Kill la Kill, Madoka Magica, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece etc. I know I named the big three, but seriously their soundtracks are outstanding if you've ever paid attention to them. The battle effects are top notch. Voice actors and actresses are great. But the music contains some pretty mediocre cinematic music. Unlike a certain ""coffee soda toffee pasta."" (if you don't get it, it's from SAO gleam eyes fight by the lovely Yuki Kajiura)

Enjoyment:9/10
Only a few moments went by that I didn't think this anime was outstanding. I was hooked by episode 4. I'm an adult, but at certain scenes, I cringed so hard that I actually couldn't watch them. That has never happened to me in any anime that I've seen. Never once. This anime has earned its spot as rank 10 on my top 10 anime list. I really believe that you will enjoy it if you like psychological, fantasy, action, Mystery, Game, or any of the anime that I've mentioned so far.

Overall:9.5/10
It would be a full 10 if it had a better soundtrack, but the soundtrack thing really doesn't matter to me much since everything else is simply outstanding. I highly recommend that you put this one on your watchlist if you haven't already! ^.^b There will likely be a season two because of this anime's popularity worldwide so see you next time!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"Re:Zero started out amazing for the first four episodes, became average but still entertaining enough midway through, and then ultimately became a complete terrible farce in the last third. 

The characters are just downright awful.

The main character, Subaru, is a selfish entitled self-centred cunt. Which is fine at first because that's the way the he was written to be, and the story punishes his actions and attitude. But in the last third of the series, one by one all the characters start sucking the main character's cock. All of a sudden Subaru can do nothing wrong and everyone kisses his feet. He hasn't changed one
                  ...
bit, he's every bit the same cunt that he was at the start, but suddenly the show is rewarding him. 

Rem starts out pretty interesting, but in time becomes nothing but flatly-written waifu bait. There are multi-dimensional fascinating characters that would also happen to make a great waifu, and there are characters that exist for the sole reason of pandering to the viewers. Rem unfortunately is the latter. There's zero personality or thought behind any of her actions other than being in love with the main character. Her character development died the moment she fell for Subaru.

Emilia is your generic nice girl, and just when she starts showing the least bit of development, when she calls out Subaru for his bullshit and tells him to fuck off, she then gets shafted for the rest of the series. Subaru's so-called ""love"" for Emila is nothing but toxic possessiveness; at one point he even says ""you should have a greater debt to me than you could ever repay"".

The show is that it ends up being the complete opposite of what it set out to do. It ends up being nothing but a self-insert wish-fulfilment fantasy. I'll be the one to say it: Sword Art Online season 1 as whole is better than Re:Zero; at least it never tries to pretend that its anything more than the fulfilment fantasy it is.

The selection of candidates for the throne? All shifted aside to watch the main character playing hero. Why he was transported into this alternate dimension? Not explained. Why the main character can keep reviving time after time when he dies? Not explained. Why can he only revive at particular save points, which change throughout? Not explained. Why even bother? The writers can just throw anything they want into the story without any explanation.

Don't even get me started on the atrocious writing. Subaru's so-called PTSD magically appears and then goes away at random; whichever is more convenient for the plot at that point in time. His supposed turning point in the series goes something like this:

Subaru: I AM USELESS I HATE MYSELF
Rem: I LOVE YOU SUBARU
Subaru: OK, I AM FANTASTIC AND I LOVE EMILIA :D LoOoOL, HELP ME SAVE HER?
Rem: YES! :)))))))

Atrocious.

What does this show prove? Just add a bit of gore and deaths and edginess and everyone with circlejerk over it and go all ""2dark2deep4u"". If this show is supposedly the ""saviour of anime"", then the entire medium is beyond redemption. Just look at all the waifu wars amongst the show's fans, it shows you what kind of target audience is intended for the show. If not for the brilliant first four episodes I would rate the show even lower. Don't waste your time on this, its overrated, overhyped, utterly pretentious, and not worth watching."

He gets transported to a fantasy world. he has no idea how he got there, but is amazed of what happens. he meets an elf named Satella(?), and helps here retrieve something stolen from her as thanks for helping him out. they make it to the thieves hide out, and Subaru and Satella die, as Suburu closes his eyes one last time, they suddenly reopen and he finds himself back at where he started. he finds out he can time reset after death and that's where the story starts kinda. 
sounds like a cool
                  ...
premise,huh, but here is why it isn't.

Animation-The animation for the anime is above average, the character designs are good, the fights look awesome and have impact, and the setting looks beautiful at times. however you can see where they cut corners. the background characters in large areas are CGI it's not hard to notice but it's there and it is bothersome. despite me saying they have good character design most of them feel underwhelming. 7/10

Sound- Is forgettable, that's it really. it's there and fits, but doesn't stand out. the voice acting is OK, when it comes to screaming pains of agony. 5/10

Story- From the summary what I told you sounds like an interesting premise, right? but that's really it an interesting premise. Subaru suffering shows how bad an idea someone surviving a fantasy world can be, but because of time resets there are very little consequences. the time reset itself is more than plot armor, but one giant plot convenience that keeps the story going in circles until Subaru gets it right. what do you know everything turns out all right in the end, hur fukin ray! very little world building, very little stakes and motivation, and very little interesting characters. 2/10

Character- not much to say they're mostly all two dimensional characters. they just react to the situation without really growing, and any changes just revert back to zero (get it!). However rem is best girl because she has more depth and growth than any other character in the show, even with the resets(blue haired girl). 3/10

Enjoyment-From all the episodes there are only three that kept my interest, which where the action ones. the final assassin fight and the white. whale subjugation. The only reason is because it's only where animation shines the most,and the story can be forgotten for a while. 3/25 episodes

Summary- Good animation,OK sound and voice acting, bad story and character, and didn't enjoy it that much. Anything impressive only lasted a while and in retrospect where quite lackluster. 4/10"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"Re:Zero is one of those shows that can completely alter the way you look at anime. After all, it is a popular adage that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. And yet, that is exactly what I did when I first looked upon its PV’s and early impressions. At the time, it looked to me like a weird Sword Art Online clone and could thus, be safely ignored. But as the summer season rolled on, the show continued to hold its high aggregate score and the hype and forum buzz was only getting stronger and stronger. Like a moth drawn to a flame,
                  ...
I decided, against my better judgement, to follow the crowd and give this Re:Zero thing a try. To my dismay, what I found may not have been quite Sword Art Online, but it certainly wasn’t much better…

Story:

	Despite this show’s many problems that I will be discussing, the story is without a doubt one of the weakest parts of Re:Zero. It begins with our main protagonist Natsuki Subaru, a loser NEET who has nothing in life besides video games and radio calisthenics, being randomly transported into a fantasy world. Only a little confused, but mostly pants-shittingly excited, our hero proceeds to run into an alley and get mugged by the anime three-stooges. To his luck he is saved by a half-elven girl named Emilia and proceeds to follow her around as she chases after a loli thief girl that stole her precious insignia. As this subplot plods along, Subaru discovers three things: 1) when he dies, he is sent back into a random/convenient place in time, reminiscent of a video game checkpoint. 2) He really sucks at staying alive. And 3) for reasons unknown, he is really into this Emilia chick.

For what it’s worth, Re:Zero’s plot has a lot going on and it would be difficult and very spoilery to sit here and summarize much more of it. But what the plot has in quantity, it certainly doesn’t hold any weight in the quality department. The show will have you scratching your head from the very beginning as Subaru is transported into this fantasy world for seemingly no reason and without any process. He doesn’t fall through a worm hole, doesn’t get cursed by a roadside fortune teller, and he didn’t purchase a VR headset at his local convenience store. He simply walks outside, blinks, and he’s in it. Even if you are desperate to have your modern Japanese hero have his adventure in a fantasy world, the least you can do as a writer is try to explain it, and this is never touched upon again in the series.

	The other big problem with Re:Zero’s plot is that there is no overarching goal that is presented for our protagonist and his “friends” to work towards. He seems perfectly happy to be stuck in this world, so it’s not like there is any sort of desire to leave. He certainly never even bothers to accurately convey where he is from to any of the characters, instead insisting that he is from the Eastern most country of this fantasy world, despite already being in the eastern most country of this fantasy world. Nobody ever really questions him on this or finds it suspicious, either. There is something about the Demi Human War, but that’s never touched upon again despite the implications that humans hold a secret, racist prejudice towards these Demi Humans. In fact, aside from Emilia and her half-elven roots, no other Demi Human seems to be persecuted in any way, no matter how bad their CG models are. There are also no other elves for some reason, but I guess that’s not important. There is talk of a powerful Dragon and a mystical Evil Witch, but even that is given little context besides “Evil Witch bad, must not be named until next season is confirmed!” 

        No, Subaru’s seemingly only goal in this universe is to get into Emilia’s pants as he instantly clings to her as his sole reason for living and follows her around from subplot to subplot like a clingy puppy desperate for affection. This gives the plot a meandering feeling as Subaru and friends jump around from one contrived predicament to another, regardless of how loosely they are connected and how little they contribute to the world as a whole. They start with a little subplot about a loli thief stealing an insignia that is coveted by both Emilia and some psycho assassin lady with huge boobs. Once that is resolved, those characters are recycled as Subaru and Emilia go hang out in a mansion. There, they find new characters and a subplot about how Subaru must find a way to contrive his new, slice-of-life/romcom life with Emilia, all while learning how to be a subpar butler and avoiding being brutally murdered every night by evil stuff. Once the hilariously random identity of the killer is revealed and the subplot finds its way to its cringey, happy ending, THESE characters all get recycled as Subaru and Emilia head back to the city to have a subplot about some political election. 

         This goes on and on and on and on. From political election to bad love triangle, from bad love triangle to random killer whale, from random killer whale to evil witch cult, all the way to a stunningly underwhelming conclusion where nothing is really accomplished, but everything is setup for future seasons of the show. That’s right, the show isn’t over. And, considering how many characters and subplots Re:Zero has managed to introduce in such a short time, the show could conceivably last another two or three seasons depending on how badly the author decides to stretch it out. 

Characters:

 	As bad as they all are to me, I think it is safe to say that the characters are a rather mixed bag. This is, at least, true for everyone except for Subaru. It is my belief that entire college theses, if not books and novels, can be written on just what an awful protagonist Natsuki Subaru is. In many ways, he is a monstrous amalgamation of all of the worst traits of the protagonists that have come before him. The most obvious trait would be his ADHD hyper activeness that could give Naruto and One Piece’s Luffy a run for their money.  Get ready to cringe as Subaru disco poses his way into every scene, regardless of how brutally he was murdered just a second ago, all while spouting meta dialogue/commentary about anything and everything that just happened, giving all the characters stupid and embarrassing nicknames, making anime (Evangelion, primarily) and video game references, and desperately trying to flirt with a thick girl in ways that would make even the most clueless of shut-ins and guys who flirt with Wal-Mart cashiers want to kill themselves. 

           From the book of Emiya Shirou, Subaru borrows the unshakable belief that he is born to be a hero of justice and must therefore, chauvinistically, defend everything with a vagina from the forces of evil, despite the fact that the people he is protecting are far more capable than he. At the very least Shirou eventually learns how to fight, whilst Subaru’s greatest strengths end up his uncanny abilities to run away, scream, cry, and be bait while other characters do all of the work that he then takes credit for. Also Shirou’s chauvinism is born of a naïve, goody two-shoes personality, while Subaru’s is born of, according to episode 13, a personality that is selfish and egotistical in nature. Lastly, he totally stole Shirou’s track suit jacket from Unlimited Blade Works, but that’s not nearly as egregious. Amongst many other traits, there is Ikari Shinji’s pension for running away and crying like a bitch, Makoto Itou’s uncanny ability to treat the women closest to him like garbage, and Kirito’s overall blandness. There is a small part towards the middle where Subaru shows off a little self-awareness of just what an awful piece of shit he really is, but it’s short, by then the damage is done, and he pivots back into being an annoying, unlikable, duffus immediately afterwards, so it’s kinda wasted.

            We then have the two Asuna’s of the show, Emilia and Rem, who appropriately start off as seemingly strong, independent characters, before they are robbed of their spines and forced to serve as ego boosts for our infamous protagonist. Coincidentally, these two are mainly remarkable because of their involvement in the love triangle of the series. First there’s Emilia, whose design of white hair, white clothes, and white accessories perfectly alludes to her character, as she has the blandness of milk and the “special” status of a snowflake. What starts off as a strong and confident (if shy) character who isn’t afraid to frown or squint, quickly turns into a moéblob of sweetness and innocence once Subaru “saves” her and establishes his superiority. After a while, she can’t even be upset with Subaru without seeming apologetic for it, and that’s before the show relegates her to be a damsel in distress who conveniently forgets she has ice magic and a furry guardian spirit capable of turning into a giant wolf-bear monster that can freeze anything in a 100 mile radius. Clearly that’s not good enough, so best to just sit in a wagon/castle and let useless Subaru fumble his way through everything.

          Second there’s Rem, whose sexy maid outfit perfectly foreshadows her degeneration from a badass killing machine to a blushing doormat. Rem, and by extension her sister Ram, is one of the few characters in this show that has an actual backstory. Even our protagonist isn’t blessed with such a miracle, so when you see a backstory told in this show, it actually stands out. Rem’s is, fortunately, good and this makes her a rather interesting character with at least an ounce of depth. Combine that with her giant flail and Unit-01-esque “Berserker” mode, and you have an early favorite for a lot of viewers, me included. This, too, goes away once Subaru “saves” her from bad, CG wolf monsters. From that point on, Rem is relegated to walk around in Subaru’s shadow as she showers him with love and ensures him that he isn’t a total piece of shit. Her status as a doormat comes to fruition in an infamous scene where, after being rejected by our idiot protagonist, Rem happily accepts his offer to be a cuckold as she puts her life on the line to help Subaru get into Emilia’s pants. I found this turn of events pretty disgusting, and I wasn’t even shipping these two.

           None of the other characters are particularly remarkable. The previously mentioned loli thief is turned into a one-dimensional anarchist. The show then introduces some bitchy, overconfident election rivals for Emilia, who I presume will actually be touched upon in future installments of the show. Crusch, the one we actually get to spend any time with, felt lacking besides the “Storm Ruler” that she clearly knicked from Demon’s Souls. In her service, we have Ferris, a crossdressing catboy who is incredibly annoying, and Sir Wilhelm, an overpowered butler knight who honestly feels like he fell out of a different anime altogether and whose backstory is so cliché that you’ll wish the author just didn’t even bother. It’s not like you NEED to rip off Moby Dick to justify killing a never before mentioned giant whale monster that terrorizes the country side. There’s also a red haired and a purple haired knight, but they are just muscle for Subaru to lean on in each half of the series. Back at the mansion we have a pedophile clown who owns the premises, but fucks off before anything interesting could actually happen to him. There is also Beatrice, who seemingly only exists to be the second coming of Suiseiseki as she tries to turn ‘Kashira’ into the modern version of the ‘Desu’ Meme. Quite possibly the best character of the show is Ram, Rem’s older sister and possible sexual victim of the predatory clown man. Not only does she have a legitimately interesting backstory, but her personality and dialogue are more than tolerable and she becomes completely ignored long before Re:Zero has a chance to somehow drive her character into the ground. This is certainly more than I can say for the unimaginative psycho that is Betelgeuse, quite possible the worst villain I have ever seen. His array of abilities include invisible tentacle hands, somehow worse dialogue than Subaru, and a penchant for chewing soo much of the scenery that I’m amazed the show doesn’t end with a Sopranos-esque random cut to black.

Presentation:

	I’ll keep this section short, because if there is one thing this show does right, it’s the art, animation, and music. Produced by White Fox, whose resume includes beautiful works like Steins;Gate and Katanagatari, it is no surprise to me that Re:Zero, at the very least, manages to look good. Great care is especially put into scenes of extreme, gory violence, which grab your attention even if you don’t particularly care for the characters. Likewise, White Fox does a great job with Re:Zero’s more touching moments, as the way girls like Rem and Emilia smile will send your heart straight to moé heaven, even if the girls aren’t very heavenly themselves. The fight scenes also tend to look nice, especially when Wilhelm of Astrea is on the screen, tearing foes to pieces in a display of lightning fast flashes of blood smears. I also really liked the detail that went into the eyes of characters like Emilia and Beatrice, as it stood out in a rather charming way. My main nitpick would be with some of the uses of CG, as the Demi Humans and Ground Dragons rendered in CG looked and moved with that familiar CG awkwardness that is only emphasized by the drawn, 2D characters present in the same scenes.

	On the music end, I enjoyed both the OP’s and ED’s for both halves of the season, with the first set being superior in typical anime tradition. Because I enjoyed them, though, it is kind of a shame that Re:Zero has a penchant for skipping them every other episode or so. Since there is nothing particularly remarkable musically within the actual show, it makes the exclusion of the OP’s and ED’s really stand out. What does stand out in the show is a track simply titled “Creepy Sound”. True to its title, any time anything “creepy” happens in Re:Zero, a gaggle of Asian women hack out a high-pitched wail that makes my ears bleed and instantly robs the scene of any tension that it might have been trying to build up. Could have done without that, personally.

Overall:

	Re:Zero’s biggest crime is that it is unbearably and unbelievably boring. Re:Zero is the type of show that is soo damn proud of itself, that it garishly reveals its hand within the first few episodes and expects the viewer to revel in its genius as it plays the same hand over and over and over again. The show expects you to care about Subaru’s death and suffering long before it establishes him as anything more than a generator of silly poses and pop culture references. It expects you to believe in an unshakable romance long before Subaru and Emilia have had any meaningful, romantic interactions together. The reason why superior shows like Steins;Gate and Higurashi managed to make this similar setup work is because they spend time on character growth and interaction before letting the shit hit the fan. They show the viewer all of the reasons for why they should care about these characters long before they are actually expected to.  

          In between the few flashes of brilliance that the show actually has, are long stretches of what feels like filler as the show tries to space itself out with awkward dialogue, random subplots, and a seemingly endless reservoir of characters that it hopes will stick to the viewer long enough to get them through the slog. Despite all the allusions to Sword Art Online, Re:Zero is very clearly not a clone of said show. Despite failing miserably, it is clear that it is at least trying to be some kind of serious subversion/deconstruction of tropes with a Groundhog’s Day premise that has an actual chance of being interesting further down the line. Sadly, my goodwill for this show has already been depleted by this “prologue” and I do not see myself returning for any more adventures with Subaru and friends. Just like our protagonist, I have suffered through this mind-numbing mess of an anime and I shall suffer it no more."

Re: Zero is one of the best anime recently released. The protagonist, Natsuki                    Subaruis high school student sent to another world. He is a shut in NEET who presumably plays rpgs and has watched a few animes containing the boy sent to another world trope.(somewhat affecting his attitude and actions) 

CHARACTERS: 9/10
 What really ties this series
                  ...
together are the characters specifically the main character Natsuki Subaru. Subaru while mostly powerless in this new world, cannot die. Whenever Subaru dies, he returns to a specific point in time. The conditions and limits of this power are mostly unexplained(Not going to give too much away there). Subaru's interactions with other characters are never the same in each time line because his death changes his perspective with each time. This allows us to see multiple sides of the same characters. Subaru's interactions with characters don't even necessarily improve with every reincarnation. Subaru's character development is not on a straight line. He is a realistic protagonist in that his actions frequently won't be liked by the viewer. There are other characters central to the plot but a lot of their emotional development spoils the plot. 

SOUND: 10/10
 The soundtrack always fits the mood of the show and it has a nice therapeutic feel. And the openings and endings... Holy duck, masterpieces.

ANIMATION: 7/10
 Well, this is where the show falters a bit. The CGI backgrounds and background characters feel somewhat out of place sometimes but there can be some truly beautifully animated scenes despite this.(Don't worry even the bad parts aren't new Berzerk bad or even worse.... Food Fight..... (shudders)).

PLOT: 10/10
 The show really does a great job with the plot for every alternate timeline it makes. There are some truly dark ways the story plays out depending on Subaru's actions or lack there of. There are usually emotional moments regardless of the timeline. It may be kind of weird at the beggining, but as the episodes go by, it goes getting better and better, and when you think it could not get any better, they prove you wrong."

First of all, the characters are unique. I love Subaru, who is a leading character, because he is similar to me. Perhaps some people dislike him because he had a bad personality and manner. However, such a person is common in our society, so I can sympathize with him.

Secondly, this story attracts me, especially the last parts. I could not wait for the next ones. To be honest, I am not satisfied with the final episode because some parts are unclear, for instance, Rem.

Overall, this anime is definitely categorized as one of the
                  ...
best Animes in this year and I would like to recommend this to my friends."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"I have no doubt that RE:Zero is probably one of worst anime of the decade, and one of the worst i've seen in my life, how can a piece of work that only has 25 episodes be so incredible bad and mediocre? How is it possible this anime fails at every single thing it tries to incorporate in such a terrible way?

What is RE:Zero? what is what this anime tries to be? at the start of episode 1 i got the feeling this anime was a parody, it's clearly conscious of the Isekai genre clichés yet this anime ends up doing later exactly what it
                  ...
just mentioned moments ago, i don't understand, am i supposed to find that funny? am i supposed to find the retarded behavior of the MC funny? people find characters with chameleonic personality are considered cool these days? you can feel your brain cells dying at an incredible speed while watching this anime and their characters interacting.

But that's ok, Re:zero is not a parody or a comedy anime, that's fine, is this a romance anime then? No, the special ability our main character has leaves no room to the development of the other characters or their relationships ergo the character chemistry is terrible and inorganic, only a retarded teenager who has no idea how real human relationships work will think this romance is well done.

But that's ok? This is not a parody or a romance anime, is this some senseless action series then, like Gurren Lagann or Kill la Kill? Nope, this series takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously, it's way too edgy, it's impossible to say this anime is just pure and senseless action, so it fails again here, if this is not enough for you then let me mention that the battle sequences doesn't make any sense at all either, i want this review to be spoiler free but if i have to put an example i'd say watch ep. 3 if you have more than 4 completely functional brain cells you'll notice what i'm talking about.

So ok, this is not a parody, a romance anime or an action series, is this a psychological thriller then? all the characters are extremely simple, as generic as they can be, in this wonderful anime you'll find: the maid lolis, generic waifus who love our beta MC for no good reason, traps, furries, drill lolis, that other thing... you know that thing with the green hair, the uni-dimensional psycho, etc.

The audiovisuals are not even good either, the colour palette is a extremely poor choice, the music is ok but it's forgettable and character design is as generic as the personality of the characters.

We have another pathetic and generic Isekai anime, just another Konosuba, Overlord, Mondaiji-tachi, SAO, No Game No Life, etc.... don't waste even 20 seconds of your time in this insult to the humankind."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Re:Zero is an amazing anime, one of the best I've seen to date. I've felt a plethora of emotions while watching every episode, ranging from sadness, joy, anger, etc. I was hooked since the first episode and often, the wait until next week's episode would be unbearable. It was extremely difficult not to read spoilers, the web novel, or the light novels after finishing an episode. I loved that within a single episode, there would be silly moments that made me laugh and smile and on the other side of the spectrum, moments to which I would be on the edge of my seat and
                  ...
my mind racing. I have to say, the author is truly skilled at manipulating the hearts and emotions of the audience.
As for the characters, I loved all of most of the characters and their own unique personalities. Subaru, for example, really seems like a normal person, instead of the typical protagonists with barely any faults. He smiles, laughs, cries, gets angry, and breaks down when he's put under hard circumstances that are difficult to overcome. With this, it was easy for me to relate to this character and replicate his emotions. 
The voice actors and actresses did an amazing job, capturing the emotions of the characters with every word, as well as the opening, ending, and soundtrack adding more on to this incredible anime. 
I hope that the second season of Re:Zero comes out soon because I can't wait to see what's in store for Subaru, Emilia, Rem, and the rest!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"First of all, this is going to be a long review so if you have the time then read all the details (contains some minor spoilers). ReZero has become one of the successful light novel fantasy adaption of not just last decade but in history of anime ever. 

Plot: A normal/regular guy named Natsuki Subaru unexpectedly enters into a fantasy world full of animal like warriors, assassins, knights, witches, magic users and so on. While the story hasn’t fully explained why he entered into the fantasy world in the first place, I am hoping all those explanations would come sometime at the end of the
                  ...
story. Now about the story, the settings looked cliché because travelling into a fantasy world was not uncommon thing in Anime series. So, just like many people I also thought that “O well, this is going to be another cliché fantasy anime” turns out not to be and I got those findings at the end of the first episode. So, why did I think of that? Simply because the protagonist actually dies in the first episode! So, it seemed to be but he was revived after he was killed by an assassin along with the female protagonist. As the plot progresses, it was found out that Subaru has the power that’s called “Returned by Death” (simple explanation he has the power to revive if he dies). So, as the plot progress we are introduced by new characters but before that we get to introduced to female protagonist, a half elf named “Emilia” whom Subaru falls for in first sight (though she called herself Satella which is refereed to jealous witch’s name and there was no explanation why she told that in first place). The series sole motivation was to Subaru protecting Emilia. As the plot progresses, Subaru keeps dying and keeps reviving with occurring many events and trigger points (that’s all I can say to keep the spoilers at minimum, the rest was for the viewers to find out).in terms of saying how much explainable the plot is very difficult because the plot itself was very complex.  All I can say the plot starts to thickness as it goes forward. 

Characters: This section was one of the most highlighted factors of the series. There are lots of characters introduced in the series and each of those characters played their part just fine. I will focus on two factors here. Number one, Natsuki Subaru and Number two, Rem and Emilia. 

So, how is Natsuki Subaru as a protagonist?

1) He is just basically a common guy who might be an otaku/neet himself with no coolness about him whatsoever and have a Meta dialogue system of talking. (At first glances)
2) Became an absolutely annoying, stupid, horrible, bullshit type of character that you want to punch in the face. (In mid stage) 
3) Realizing his stupidity, changes his attitudes and thinks with a brain and later become a master strategist with help of his power Return by Death (3rd Phase)

So, what can be said about Subaru as overall protagonist?

In my view he is not your cool type protagonist as you expect in a fantasy series. He is not the best protagonist either but he is exactly a character which doesn’t goes with the flow and overall he is just like everyone of us, filled with smartness and stupidity which makes him a more humane protagonist and one of the best well written character in recent years. 

Section number 2, who is the main female lead, Emilia or Rem?

I would say Rem for a particular time given she has more screen time than the half elf princess but in overall I would say Emilia given she is the center of everything for Subaru. While these two characters have their own role to play, the character development was a major success. 
And finally we also have a guy whom we want to punch to death (Romanée-Conti, Betelgeuse). To be honest, this is that one guy whom has gone to my all time hated character list. There’s that one thing that I also noticed about re zero is that all the middle or minor side character has impact on the story which is very rare these days and those characters are much more involved in the story. 

Music/OST’s: Putting right kind of music in right scene is something always important for anime series to make viewers involving in it more and ReZero has certainly done it. Not to mention Myth & Roid has done great to opening and endings. Also, there were some unprecedented things that I have seen in this series and one of that is I have hardly seen any anime skip openings/endings to give much more content to the viewers. 

Overall: So, in the end in my view ReZero has become one of the successful series in not just this year but probably in last decade. There are some specific reasons as to why it has- 

1) In a directional point of view, it has been one heck of a series and kudos to director Watanabe, Masaharu who has worked in series like Zankyou no Terror, Air, Akame Ga Kill, Inuyasha but this is his first series where he directed the whole series and it was excellent. 
2) The script was excellent and to add that we have got some well written character which gave us love and hate at the same time and almost 60% of characters are popular for their personality (don’t know when the last time it has happened in a fantasy series) 
3) This series has got so much trigger point and to strong at that. Some moments gave the viewers hope and some despair. The rotations of those moments are excellent. We get to see episodes full of actions, while we also get to see episode purely based on dialogues.
4) And finally, Logic and strategy never has gone with this series at the first place. So, overall the series has delivered perfectly with emotional drives in almost every episode. 

That was a long review but these explanations aren’t enough to judge the series. I haven’t felt the amount of intensity for a long time while watching the series. Off course ReZero needs more seasons because there are tons of content in the Light Novel out there but even if there will no seasons for ReZero, it will go down as one of the top anime in fantasy genre ever in the history of anime. So, right now I can only finger crossed for more season!"
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Recommended,"Watching Re:Zero was like a rollercoaster ride for me. At times, it made me laugh. At times, it made me cry. At times, it left me shocked and at times, the show made my brain tremble but the show was still a really fun and enjoyable ride from start till the end. The show is, by no means, a flawless show but I'll explain somewhere down below why I gave this show a score of 10. (9.7, to be more specific, but who cares)

(My review will contain some SPOILERS) 

[Story]: (8/10)
When this anime was announced during the end of Winter of 2016, I had no
                  ...
expectations in this series whatsoever. I thought that Re:Zero was going to be another generic harem light novel adaptation. I still decided to give this series a shot though because why not? Episode 1A was just your typical ""MC has now been transported into the fantasy world and that's where his harem adventure begins"" crap. Oh, how wrong I was. Episode 1B completely surprised the shit out of me and it's the episode that got my complete attention. Although, it wasn't until Episode 2 or 3 where I got completely hooked with the show. This series turned out to be the opposite of what I had expected. Basically, Re:Zero is like a mixture of KonoSuba and ERASED but injected with tons of suffering and despair

The show's main character ""Subaru"" has this special ability called ""Return to Death"". The ability does what you expect it to do. Once Subaru dies, he gets revived in a designated checkpoint. Like a RPG, if you will. I'm sure you're going to ask questions like ""Where's the tension if he gets revived anyways?"" or ""Who cares if he dies? He's going to be revived anyways"". Oho, for the most part, you're wrong. The ability may look like a deus-ex machina for Subaru but trust me, it's not. The ability is more like a useful ability for Subaru's character growth but at the same time, it's like a cursed ability for him. A few months ago, when CR was advertising Re:Zero, they used a quote which I thought was really clever. It says: 

""Dying over and over is a fate worse than death"". 
I couldn't agree more. Dying is basically an easy way out and not being able to take the easy way out and being forced to relive the terrible situation that you just faced will leave you a mental scar. Just thinking of death alone will make, even the strongest person, to break down. That's why I said it's like a cursed ability for him. Subaru, has the advantage, of going back into a designated checkpoint and yet, he avoids using the ability as much as possible because the psychological and physical pain that comes with death is overbearing for him. We see that the more Subaru dies, the more mentally fucked up he gets. I really love how Subaru's way of thinking is realistic. Not something that I usually get in an anime but I welcome it. Anyways, Subaru's mental breakdown will be evident in the 2nd and 3rd Arc of the series.  

What makes the ability more complicated for him is the fact that he can't tell anyone about his ability. If he tries then Subaru suffers the consequences. When he dies and resets to a new timeline, he can only rely on himself to use his knowledge that he gained from the previous timeline into the new timeline to solve whatever is going on. Plus, he has to repeat almost everything that he did in the previous timeline. Not something that I'd want to go through after all the hard work that I did. This is the kind of the character growth that I'm talking about which was the aspect that I loved about Re:Zero. He doesn't physically get strong but mentally, he does. By using his profound knowledge to deal with the situation. Though, this doesn't work all the time for him but that's all I'll have to say.   

The show has 3 arcs. The 1st arc is the ""A Day in the Capital"" arc. It's basically an introduction arc and this arc proves us that Re:Zero is not what we think it is when we first watched the show. 
The 2nd arc is the ""Mansion"" arc. The 2nd arc lasted a lot longer than the 1st arc. At first, I thought it was being dragged out but I couldn't be more wrong. This arc is now starting to set-up the story and introduces us to a bunch of characters like the two cute maids, a loli and the head of the mansion. This arc is also where the deconstruction of a LN genre begins. For example, those two maids aren't just a couple of simple maids and there's actually more to them than just ""simple maids"". Usually, the maids in the LN anime adaptation that I've watched are just a bunch of useless nobodies who's just in there for fanservice but in here, they're not. It actually felt like they were part of the show and actually contributed to the show's progression. My opinions on this arc are very slow story progression but amazing character development for several characters. The story only progressed for like a week but this arc lasted for 8 episodes. I was watching this show weekly so I had to watch this arc for 8 weeks. I'm actually not going to complain much about the story progression because the character development is phenomenal. We see Rem's character development, Ram's character, Subaru's character development and etc. Man, the amount of time that they spent developing these characters is shocking and brilliant at the same time. 

The 3rd arc is the ""Truth of Zero"" arc. This arc is, by far, the longest arc in the series (not counting the future arcs) which spanned for 13 episodes. Before the 3rd arc started, several Re:Zero LN/WN readers have warned anime-only viewers (which also includes me) that the 3rd arc's tone will be more darker than the previous arcs and Subaru will suffer more than he did in the previous arcs. They said that this arc will be unbearable for some and not everyone will be able to handle this arc. At first, I took their words with a grain of salt because I was like ""How darker could this series possibly get? If I can handle Arc 2, then I sure as hell can handle Arc 3"". Oh, how wrong I was. If I were to personally summarize my feelings for this arc, I would have to say, it was like a rollercoaster ride. In other words, my review opener relates heavily on what I felt about the 3rd arc. While the story progression of this arc was, yet again, very slow and didn't really focus that much on the Elections right after the fight occurred between Emilia and Subaru, the character development in this arc was god-tier amazing. Words just can't express how amazing and how much I love the character development in Arc 3. Just watching Subaru's character growth and Rem's character development in this arc was unbelievable and just.....Gah!, Amazing! In my years of watching other mediums and also anime, this comes out on the Top 3. Even rivaling one of my favourite TV shows of all time, Game of Thrones. I just love how much of a human Subaru is. If you're going to try and argue with me on this then please bring a Psychology student along with you because I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who doesn't understand complex human emotions. Otherwise, just don't bother. 

Now that I'm done talking about all of the arcs, I can finally talk about the other aspects of the show. For starters, the pacing. The pacing of the show was decent. It wasn't great but I don't think it was bad either. The show, most notably on the start of Arc 3, sometimes suffers from poor pacing by rushing things through. I really don't mind the slow pacing of the show because I'm the kind of person who prefers slow pacing but not those very slow paced show. Secondly, plot holes. If you look at Re:Zero's Web Novel, the story is fucking ginormous. The WN is at the 6th arc and it's only about halfway through. Since the anime only adapted the first 3 arcs, it's no surprise that the show would contain plot holes. The source material eventually fills the plot holes but I just can ignore the anime's plot holes. Plot holes like ""How Subaru was transported into the fantasy world?"", ""Who the hell is Satella and what does she want with him?"" and etc.  

Thirdly, the dramatic aspect of the show was very well-done. There are some melodramatic scenes in the anime but it's only a few and the melodrama was bearable. For the most part, Re:Zero has just the right amount of drama, whether it's the confession scene between Rem and Subaru in Ep.18 or Subaru using Emilia as his lap pillow and just letting all his emotions out.  They worked because I actually feel for the characters, especially Subaru and all the shit that he has gone through. For example, when Subaru let all his emotions out while using Emilia's lap as a pillow, I knew what he felt. He was doing everything in his power to solve the mystery that was plaguing him in the mansion but he realized it was too hard for him. 

Even though the show has flaws, whether that may be minor or major flaws (plot holes, lack of character development for some characters and etc.), I still gave this show a score of 10. I even gave Madoka Magica Movie 3: Rebellion a score of 10 despite its flaws and it's the same case for Re:Zero. Phenomenal Character Development, Mostly-Well Done Dramatic Scenes, ,Realistic and Flawed Main Protagonist, and scenes from Ep. 8, 11, 15, 23 and especially Episode 18 are the leading factors that made me decide to give this show a score of 10. In fact, if I were to rate the 18th Episode alone, I would immediately give it a 10/10, no debates. It was an episode that mostly consisted of dialogue scenes but it was just as fucking great as the Monogatari Series' dialogue scenes. 
______________________________________________________________
[Art/Animation]: (9/10)
I still think Steins;Gate (Studio White Fox) is the studio's best work in terms of art and visuals but White Fox still managed to get the job well done in terms of Animation. The visuals are amazing. They managed to create a world with a fantasy-feel to it. The character designs looks good, in my opinion, but it looks like your typical light novel harem fantasy anime adaptations. There's cute girls, maids, traps and etc. Not like I have any problem with it. The character expressions though. They are really outstanding, especially Subaru's expression in the 3rd Arc. 

The animation was mostly good but when it came to the fighting scenes, I think that's where White Fox suffered. The fighting scenes in the 1st Arc and some parts of the 2nd Arc looked good but as the show progressed, the animation quality kind-of dipped. The fighting scenes in the 3rd Arc felt so-and-so. Especially the battle with the Flying Whale and The Final battle with Betelgeuse. 
______________________________________________________________
[Sound]: (9.5/10)
Re:Zero has a wide variety of soundtracks that are exceptionally well-done. From OSTs that sounds like something that you'd hear when you're playing a RPG to OSTs that sounds batshit scary (I.e, OST that plays when Subaru time-resets or when Satella ""shows"" up), it was unbelievably good. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)

The OP theme songs are ""Redo"" by Konomi Suzuki and ""Paradisus-Paradoxum"" by MYTH & ROID. The 1st OP sounded decent and the only thing that stood out to me was how the OP gave me a Steins;Gate vibe and a clever start and ending point that made it look like the OP was literally in a loop. The 2nd OP is where its at though. The tone and the atmosphere of the song was like a message from White Fox telling us that ""Playtime is over"". Also, because of this song, MYTH and ROID is/are now one of my favourite Japanese bands of all-time. They sounded really great. 
The ED theme songs are  ""STYX HELIX"" by MYTH & ROID and ""Stay Alive"" by Emilia's VA. MYTH and ROID just did an outstanding job with the 1st ED. Everything about the song sounds really, really great. The 2nd ED, on the other hand, felt a bit underwhelming, compared to the badass 1st ED, but it was still a good song and I pretty much love how the 2nd ED is basically a story about Emilia's life after the fight occurred between her and Subaru. It's like they didn't want to give her screentime in the 3rd Arc so they just told a ""how she's doing"" story in the form of a song. 

I don't usually review Japanese voice actors because I'm not Japanese and they all sound the same to me anyways but I really want to talk about the brilliance of voice acting in Re:Zero. The voice actors in this show did a hell of a great job when it comes to voice acting. Especially Subaru, Rem, Betelguese and his fingers (not literally his fingers :/). In all honestly, they all deserve a pay raise. They all did an outstanding job expressing the characters emotions. Subaru's VA Yuusuke Kobayashi did a great job expressing Subaru's suffering, despair, fear, and his acts of greed and selfishness. Rem's VA Inori Minase did a great job expressing Rem's emotions and her loyal personality. At first,  I couldn't believe that Rem's VA was the same VA as Chino from a slice of life series that was also created by White Fox. Betelgeuse's VA Yoshitsugu Matsuoka did a great job expressing Betelgeuse's over-the-top insanity. He made it really convincing that Betelgeuse's insanity was on a whole another level.

[Characters]: (10/10)
The characters....The characters and their character development are the REASON why I'm giving this show a score of 10. Like I said earlier in my reviews, the show may have flaws but because of the outstanding and phenomenal Character Development, I just decided to give this show a 10. So why do I love these characters?...Let's find out. 

First, we have Subaru Natsuki. An 18 year-old NEET who suddenly got transported into a fantasy world and has an ability called ""Return by Death"". Subaru is an unusual MC. He's not like one of those typical shounen protagonist who is dense, has a harem and has an ass-pull powers that makes said typical shounen protagonist so overpowered. He has an ability, sure, but his ability is like a gift and curse at the same time.  He tries not to use his ability too much because of the physical and psychological pain that comes along with dying. What's more unusual about him is you don't see a character like Subaru every so often in anime. In other words, you don't see a mostly realistic character like him all the time. He has a flawed personality  , just like every other human being on this planet, that will make you dislike him and some of his actions will make you cringe or question what in the fuck he's doing? However, I don't mean those statements in a bad way. Just put yourself in his shoes and think of how much shit he's gone through. Mental trauma can mess with your logical thinking and can cause you to do questionable actions like Subaru. 

If you disliked/hate Subaru after the start of the 3rd Arc then the author has done his job. He's not supposed to be a stereotypical perfect MC and you're not supposed to side with him all the time. That was the author's intentions. Every human being has a flawed and shitty personality that other people hate. Some of us are hypocrites, some of us are a bunch of great liars or some of us look down on people for what they look like. What's his? He's a selfish prick who thinks that he should be rewarded for doing good deeds, hence the reason why the fight between him and Emilia even happened. Though, he did acknowledged all his actions and later redeemed himself. 

Next up is Emilia, a silver haired half-elf girl. She is a kind, good-natured girl who likes to help others but she faces discrimination from other people just because she looks like a Witch. Honestly, I don't have much to say about her because she was gone for most of the 3rd Arc and her character development was extremely lacking, making it hard for me to give a crap about her as opposed to Rem. I would have question the staff's motives because she's supposed to the be the heroine of the series and yet, she didn't get that much character development. Except she will, in the 2nd Season (if the series gets one). I read the 4th arc of the series and the 4th arc will definitely quiet down those people who are complaining that Emilia didn't get that much character development. Emilia is still one of my favourite characters though BUT the top spot goes to Rem. 

Since there's no way in hell I'm going to be talking about every characters in the series, I'm going to skip right to my favourite character of the series, Rem. When Rem was first introduced, I didn't give a shit about her. I thought she was going to be a side character since, you know, she's just a maid. This show surprised the hell out of me though. Not only did she get a screentime and character development in Arc 2, she turned out to be the best character in the series during Arc 3. In Arc 2, we learn about who she is and her background but in Arc 3, she showed everyone that she's clearly the BEST girl. She gained feelings for Subaru and turns out, that she's a badass and a loyal female character who's going to do everything to save Subaru, even if it kills her. She sacrificed herself countless times (In multiples timelines) just to save poor Subaru. It was pretty sad what happened to her during Ep. 18 but since I'm both a fan of Emilia and Rem, I really don't mind.  
______________________________________________________________
[Enjoyment]: (10/10)
I've been following this show since the very 1st episode and I just want to say that watching Re:Zero has been one of the most enjoyable 25 weeks of my life. Sunday was blessed day for me and now that the show is over, Sunday won't ever feel the same again.
______________________________________________________________
[VERDICT]
At first, Re:Zero felt like a stereotypical light novel anime adaptation but it turned out to be something different. Something that surprised the living hell out of me. Re:Zero may not be a masterpiece but it is one of the best shows this year and maybe in the past 5 years. Re:Zero's ""Psychological"" aspect was executed perfectly and is not something that should be taken lightly, the emotional scenes are impressive and mostly well-done but with some melodrama issues here and there. The characters are lovable, especially Rem, but when it comes to Subaru, he's not going to be beloved by many. Re:Zero's strongest element is its Outstanding Character Development. White Fox did an impressive job with how they handled the characters and their development in the series. Though, not all characters are developed but since I've read parts of Arc 4, I know that the author did not toss those characters aside. It just wasn't their time. Ugh, Sundays won't ever feel the same for me. 

Now I have one more request for White Fox. Please, Please make Season 2! (Once there's enough LN material)


[OVERALL]: (9.7/10)


Pros:
+Good Story
+The ""Psychological"" element of the show was executed perfectly plus effective use of its cliffhanger
+Powerful Ep. 8, 11, 15, 23, and especially Episode 18 with outstanding 20 min. dialogue scene and outstanding cinematography
+Amazing Soundtrack plus the Insert Songs
+Amazing Voice Actors
+Great OP and ED theme songs
+Great Pacing, for the most part
+Re:Zero's number 1 strength is its Character Development and some emotional scenes
+Great cast of characters plus Subaru is one of the most realistic character in anime. 

Cons:
-Show suffers from pacing issues at times
-Fighting Scene Animation was so-and-so in the 3rd Arc
-Some characters in the show, like Emilia and Beatrice, didn't get that much focus, screentime or character development in the 3rd Arc"

Opera is a very hard medium to get into, and I have never been able to breach the gap into it. Half of this is probably because I’m unable to link the words themselves to the music going on since I don’t exactly know languages like German or Italian. When I look at it from a God’s eye view – the plots are extremely and ridiculously melodramatic. Because I am unable to link the music properly to the lyrics, I cannot jump across into the realm of heightened and overexcessive emotion that it requires. On the other hand,
                  ...
I’m able to do so for English musicals like any of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stuff.

A plot that does not make logical or psychological sense must, at the very least, make emotional sense. No matter how ridiculous the events are – I am perfectly okay with it as long as it is able to hold that excessive operatic tenor which focuses the raw experience itself. This is why one of my favorite movies is Zulawski’s Possession – a movie that throws out any semblance of a proper narrative for a bizarre sense of overstimulation.

ReZero does not make much logical sense. It presumes that a hikikomori protagonist who self-trains will have great strength (logical) as well as the spatial awareness to manage a wide variety of combat scenarios (illogical). Oldboy has the same premise, but in there it takes the protagonist 16 years – and although that prospect is still quite shifty, it’s a lot less shifty than ReZero. The Oldboy movie is able to counterbalance this by having its fight scenes (especially the hallway one) be raw enough to show that he’s merely pushing his way through by the skin of his teeth. Not so in ReZero.

It also makes little logical sense as to why the heroines would attach themselves so swiftly to the protagonist in such a short time frame. I will not dwell on this point since many people out there have probably analyzed this aspect of the plot excessively.

I was initially intrigued with ReZero given that the first 4 episodes or so were logical in their development, if you can accept the axioms of Subaru being the type of character with the capabilities he has, and Emilia being the type of person she is. The time loop aspect was utilized very well in how it would provide multiple perspectives with regards to a small scenario to create a sense of mystery despite it being merely a simple encounter. The reveals were fair and adequate – he explores every possibility and we get a whole idea of what has to be done. How the conclusion of that arc unfolded utilized a deus ex machina, but it was one fitting within the realm of what ReZero was trying to convey – Subaru’s powerlessness in a world he doesn’t understand.

The mansion arc was where it started slipping, given that they were not as fair with the plot. In the first four episodes, most of the components of the crisis were revealed to us. In the entire mansion portion, it extensively relied on late and sudden reveals usually coming from the ‘know-it-all-but-does-nothing’ character of Beatrice. Furthermore it spent too much time on grating slice-of-life and irritatingly long psychological exposition that bases itself on that kind of ‘fish-out-of-the-water’ story for the character of Rem. The visual novel Shinju no Yakata has a route involving Twins with almost similar plot aspects – but it is done in a completely different manner.

But with all of the above flaws mentioned – does it make emotional sense? This is where the entire power of White Fox as an animation studio comes in. Their animation is crisp and it can create that sense of a fantasy town with a slightly darker feel. A problem is this – for the emotional heights, with regards to characters, they rely too much on the most conventional methods of emotional resonance. A girl standing in the middle of glowing lights. A girl basking in sunlight. A fluttering of doves. Abuse of dusk lighting. Dutch Angles to show unease, mixed with creepy vocal choirs. All of these abused with complete sincerity, without any counterbalance, and without any greater kind of beautiful spin on it. When you combine this with the already unreal characterization, you get a simultaneous sense of emotional resonance and plain manipulativeness. Possession, on the other hand is a film where the camera gets right into the actor’s and actresses’ faces, with sickly backgrounds and a focus on their body contortions and movements.

It took a full 13 episodes before White Fox began to show dignity in their abilities. ReZero is able to pull off a scale even greater than a work like Attack on Titan at times. One of the most operatically overwrought and beautiful moments is the ‘blizzard ending’ of episode 14 or the caravan chase. As the plot builds up, it really mimics that feeling of a world vastly vastly greater than any of its inhabitants – massive beasts, mad cultists in dark dungeons, regal proceedings etc… This is where the aesthetics most match the emotional tone of whatever is happening within the plot – moreso than any other moment. 

Some people have characterized this as a non-stop tirade of violence and suffering for the sake of sheer manipulation. That is true, but that is only in the realm of content – but what makes a work like ReZero different (at times, although a lot of it is true blue misery porn) from a lot of other misery porn is that White Fox’s usage of scale allows the plot to orient away, at times, from the smallness of the character’s feelings. These moments, few as they are, creates that kind of perspective that person like Lovecraft was fond of exploring. The cosmic horror and insignificance perspective.

Yet, unlike a work like Evangelion, the problem is that while the animation helps to pull the plot out – the plot is always there to dive back inside the fray a thousandfold – back to those melodramatic moments without any sense of aesthetics or any new take. The widely favored episode 18 is merely a recapitulation of a Shinji type awakening. The difference is that Anno limited the actual Congratulations moment to the last few minutes, and spent most of it in internal doubt and rumination. On the other hand, Re Zero is quick to show that Subaru will be able to get his cathartic moment, and he will get immediate reprieve for it, and then he falls back into his catharsis, and gets reprieve. This is like an entire 15-20 minutes of Shinji being hugged and kissed by the plot. It is also done in a kind of ridiculously stale way full of sunlight and flying white birds. It is excessive in a bad way, and not an operatic way. Think about how the impact would have been if the scene had been shot with no focus on the character’s faces or expressions at all, but only on various different camera angles or body parts – only giving a direct view of Rem at the last moment. Compared to the stretch that came before it, I do not think particularly highly of this episode – even though it provides a just realization to the protagonist and is the most psychologically direct scene in the whole show.

On a personal level, I give this show a 9 – purely due to schadenfreude. I hope this success will mean that White Fox will get to adapt weird things like Katanagatari again."
Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu/reviews?spoiler=on&p=5,Not Recommended,"This review contains massive spoilers. I've decided to write it in a way that I am not holding anything back and thus spoilers are unavoidable. 

Re:Zero. Possibly the most popular anime in 2016, everyone is talking about it. Its rating on MAL was pretty high that I recalled it reaching 8.80+ during its peak. For an average anime fan like myself, it'd be hard to not catch up with the latest anime trends and find out what's all the buzz about... eh?

To put it simply, after finishing this show, I could not comprehend the praise surrounding it. Perhaps it's not my type, as they say,
                  ...
tastes differ from one another. But rating it a 3? It's fair to say that I am one of those who joined in the hate bandwagon of Re:Zero, which I would not deny, for I do hate the show to a point that I was dragging myself to finish it.

The purpose of this review is to point out what I disliked about the show, I do not expect everyone to agree with me, that's for sure, but I felt compelled to write this whole thing, most of it is to satisfy my own amusement.

STORY:

My biggest critique on this part, is how the show lacked two very vital things: Identity and atmosphere. 

Let's start with identity. What is Re:Zero supposed to portray? Our protagonist Subaru got transported into a fantasy world with no reason explained whatsoever in the entirety of the show. Okay so at the very least it ticked the ""fantasy"" genre, I will give it that.

Moving on, the time travel genre was one of the most hip thing in 2016. Erased had it, ReLife had it, Orange had it, and Re:Zero also had it. Our friend Subaru apparently has the ability to perform time loops! But how does he activate it? By dying. He knows! What does this remind you of? That's right, a video game! He has the ability to load his previous data in predetermined save points! But it is way too farfetched to categorize this into the ""game"" genre just because of this, seeing this is merely my own made up point in how I see the entire time looping gimmick is presented in the show. Subaru didn't exactly enter a game, he entered a realistic fantasy world where to him, everything is real.

So what's the point of Subaru dying? To solve mysteries! To solve problems! His beloved Emilia is in danger, his friends are in danger, the entire village is in danger, the entire kingdom is in danger! He must save them all! For he is the only one blessed with such a powerful power that he was allowed multiple chances to undo the calamity and save the world! No worries if he fails, he can simply die and retry! Due to this, whatever mystery is only a matter of time for Subaru to solve. There is no time limit, which effectively eliminates every tension of the show. Oh there is suspense, it's to see how Subaru solves this heroically, having to wait week in and week out for that as it airs, I can imagine the suspense among the viewers. As such, trying to catch up with this anime and marathon it, like I did, is truly a bad idea. This is a show where buying the DVDs and Blu-Rays loses its appeal and suspense since you can just marathon the whole thing and see how Subaru pulled everything together. ""Mystery"" I'd also slash out from the genre.

Next up, ""dark"", oh the thing that captures the hearts of many fans of Re:Zero. The blood splatters! The severing of limbs! The removal of head, squashing it! Ooh! A must watch for every fans of gore and violence! While everything I mentioned in the past statement did indeed occur at some point of the show, the problem lies in how they were presented. Due to the fact that Subaru has the power to reset time, every bad outcome that was inflicted onto his friends could easily be undone simply by having him die. Where is the shock value in that? Oh Rem died, Emilia died, everyone died, so what? They will be back soon, Subaru will definitely die to make them come back. Due to this, I find it hard to feel any sadness nor pity onto our perpetually dying friends of Re:Zero, and I felt better laughing off at their ridiculous dying manner, like how I used to watch Another. 

There doesn't seem to be a limit to Subaru's ability as well, other than he will suffer some mental stress, and a sinister feeling that something is grabbing his very heart, threatening to crush it whenever he tries to reveal his time looping ability. This so-called sinister feeling is supposedly the Witch's curse which was placed onto him and granted him the time to loop time, and he can't tell anyone for he felt he's gonna die if he spilled the beans, but towards the end he was able to abuse this and never seem to have any dire consequences aside from minor panting and yelling ""I MADE IT OUT!"". No tension, no suspense. 

""Psychological"", the genre threw in mostly because of Subaru's personal issues he must tackle because of this overwhelming power he had. He is the only one with the ability to undergo character development, for there is no reason for the others to develop, seeing they might get reseted anytime soon. At one point Subaru was intoxicated by the shock of seeing many of his friends dying and he was totally in a slump for a while, but then, with no other choice to move the plot forward, he was immediately cured of this psychological shock with barely nothing to explain the cure behind it. It's standard shounen stuff, main dude is good, until he goes down and turns emo, then come back up even stronger. It's not necessarily bad writing, but the way Subaru regains his self simply by witnessing Rem dying for the nth time is pretty hard to digest on. Is the genre well explored here? Nay. 

""Comedy"", the thing that ruined the entire dark atmosphere that Re:Zero was emphasizing for 2/3 of the show. For the comedy to work in a dark show, it must not hinder the overall atmosphere that hangs around the show. If you went overboard with them, I do not know what to feel about the show anymore, am I supposed to immerse myself into the brooding nature of the show? Or am I supposed to relax myself and let the comedy soothe me? Which is it? With everyone dying all over the place, suddenly we have a cat-eared trap who wears a sexy dress and purring nyaa nyaa all over the place. When Subaru was mercilessly captured by Peltugese and has his hands chained and his emotions temporarily scarred, we see our evil villain dancing around like a clown, grabbing his poor head as he shakes with excitement ""MY HEAD TREMBLES!!!""... err what? So is this supposed to be a tragedy... or a comedy? Another anime that comes to mind which suffers the exact same issue is Akame ga Kill, in which Bulat, one of the allies of the main dude, tells him how miserable it is to be one of them, ""we must kill in order to survive in this cruel world"", right that's deep and dark indeed, but then the next scene he strips down to show his muscles and said ""I AM ALSO GAYYYY""... err what? Indeed. Comedy must be used appropriately, if it's a comedy-driven show, then let it flaunt itself be. If it's a dark show where comedy is used to lighten up the mood a little, then it must not be excessive and overshadow the dominant dark mood, good examples of how it's done well would be Rurouni Kenshin, Hellsing Ultimate, FMA:B or the more recent ERASED.

What about ""romance"" and ""harem""? Almost non-existent. Yes, most of the driving force that pushes Subaru to do most of the things he does in the show was motivated by his unwavering love for Emilia, who just happens to be the first one to help him, then after that his target is fixed and no other girl matters. Poor Rem had no chance despite dedicated an entire episode telling how much she loves Subaru, only for him to reject her with the infamous ""But I love Emilia."" Oh too bad, Rem. 

Then again, what makes Rem so popular? She had been appearing everywhere in anime sites and fan arts are multiplying faster than mushrooms. After watching the show, I finally knew. There's no competition at all! Her screen time was at least 5 times more than any other female character, which really makes me question the reason why Emilia was listed as a main character while Rem the supporting cast in the MAL page of this show. She was the one that Subaru will first see whenever he revives (during the third and longest arc), giving her tons of screentime to endear fans with. Harem? No competition at all, Subaru loves Emilia. Romance? But Emilia hardly appears in the show! What romance?

So now we have come down to this, what identity does Re:Zero has? Is it dark? Not really due to the heavy comedic tones. A comedy then? Nope too miserable with many people dying. A mystery? Just wait for Subaru to die enough times, there's no rush. A psychological thriller? Hardly justified. Time travel? Mostly a gimmick. Romance and harem? No thanks. If anything, only ""fantasy"" qualifies as the only identity of Re:Zero. And the atmosphere? Like I said earlier, it's neither dark nor comedic, it's wishy-washy and does not know what it wants to be. 

Hell, even in the end, I could argue and say that there is no plot in the show. After 25 episodes of suffering and restarting and solving mysteries, everything seems unchanged. Some say there are currently 12 volumes of LN and the anime only adapted the first three. But if you failed to tell us the point of the story in 25 episodes, it's a failure.

PRESENTATION (ART & SOUND):

The show is colorful when it's peaceful, gloomy when shit happens. It's okay here. The fight scenes are fine, but nothing extraordinary. I liked the quick camera shifts during the fight between Reinhard and Elsa, but after that nothing like it returns, which is a shame.

The voices are indeed done well, the seiyuus putting their best effort to the characters they voice. OST wise it's pretty okay too. 

CHARACTERS:

We have Subaru, whose name I often joked myself for a car, is a self-proclaimed otaku, a NEET who spends most of his time at home. Yet he has a grip strength of 70kg, claims to do sufficient exercises in his room that I won't be surprised if he can take down a Taekwondo black belt, and his reflexes are much above average. Had it not be the other characters in this fantasy world being too powerful, he would be among one of the candidates participating in the Olympics, I won't be too surprised. 

While his knowledge of the otaku culture was pretty justified and highlighted several times in the show, beyond that he is more of a Gary Stu, minus combat abilities. He is a smooth talker, every girl he meets will like him at some point, he is good with kids, he is brave and fearless, he'd die to save his loved ones, he is able to discuss political issues with the supposed candidates of the throne, to a point they had no objections and followed all of his suggestions, he is able to boost the morale of troops with actions alone, he is truly the perfect man many could dream about. Oh sure, he is flawed, he is often beaten to a pulp, he always suffer psychologically because of his time looping power, he further suffers so because no one would understand why he would know many information that others don't, simply because he could experience it, die, and live to tell the tale. And yes, at times, he had the plot armor simply because it's not the time for him to die yet, most notably during the Moby Dick sequence, everyone dies except him whereas he was the one charging first into it. What? Subaru is at best, a totally fictional character that doesn't have a shred of realism in him.

Next we have Emilia, for unknown reasons yet revealed to us, she is one of the two half-elves of the show, the other one being Satella the Jealous Witch which everybody in the world of Re:Zero hates on. Since she looks so similar to Satella, her hair, her ear, everything looks so similar, she is hated by the public, but for mad reasons only Roswaal knows, she is also one of the candidates to be the ruler of the kingdom. Gawd, please leave the poor girl alone, everyone knows she stands no chance in democracy. Beyond that, she is immeasurably sweet, her kindness knows no bounds, despite her super important emblem which gives her the right to be a candidate of the next ruler being stolen, she wouldn't mind waiting for hours beside a stranger (Subaru) whom she had just met to recover and wake up. She is also a beauty, with perfect body proportions, and she also knows magic and fights well. The perfect waifu material. Does it remind you of someone? Yes it does. Asuna from Sword Art Online. She is the embodiment of the main girl that has to be created so perfectly so that the fans have a new waifu to worship on. 

But fans of Re:Zero don't really worship Emilia, it's Rem!! How so?? Like I mentioned earlier, Rem had no competition in the show, as she had at least 5 times more screentime than any other female character of the show, probably more. What is Rem? She's a petite cute little maid, who has a twin (Ram) who is pitifully no chance to rival her twin sister's popularity. She is great at chores, and she is strong! For she is an oni! Ooh! And her boobs are pretty big! Double ooh!! The even more perfect waifu! And they gave her a tragic backstory to boot!! Triple ooh!!! It is mandatory to worship her as the new anime goddess, or the mob of Re:Zero fans will swallow you whole. Come on, it's painfully obvious that the showmakers are also getting high at Rem, that she was continuously allowed to shine no matter what. Ugh.

I had to point out this character for I had the biggest problems on him throughout the show. Felix Argail. For heaven's sake, what's the reasoning behind his creation? He is a brilliant healer, the best we know, and it's a good thing, for whenever everyone's liable to die everywhere easily, we do need someone to heal effectively and quickly to ease the suffering of people. Here's the problem, his design. Allow me to put it simply. He is a male, who has a feminine look, a feminine voice, speaks like a female, and dresses like a female, and has cat ears, and speaks nyaa nyaa every time!! What is that? More stuff to satisfy the otaku fetishes? We already had Gary Stu, perfect waifu, even perfect maido, and now nyaa trap?? Oh lord, what is becoming of our world now? A trap doesn't have to act like one, like how Nagisa in Assassination Classroom doesn't actively seek out female dresses to wear and actually acts like a boy, as we know there exists of feminine looking guys in the real world. But... but... Felix is... beyond my comprehension, truly.

Next up is the other obnoxious character I could not tolerate in the show. It's our main villain of the season, Peltugese!! Do you know the phrase ""evil for the sake of being evil""? He is one evil bastard alright, and to make him stand out, he has various quirks, let's see... ""MY HEAD TREMBLESSSSSS"", while dancing and with the most noxious of voices he repeated preaches about how sinful Subaru is for being slothful and doing nothing (while being chained), as well as not saving Rem when she was being slaughtered (he was still being chained), blablabla. SUBARASHIIIIIIII oh gawd no, please stop and die already, thanks. A good villain has to be someone who does enough to credit him/her to be a villain everyone hates, for Game of Thrones viewers, they should be familiar, as how the villains there got numerous accolades for best villain awards. Or to look closer in the anime world, Griffith of Berserk. But Peltugese? My head trembles every time he tries so hard to justify his evilness by preaching how someone can be slothful (for whatever reason, even looking at him in the eye, he will say ""oh those slothful eyes!!!"") and dancing like a maniac, as well as having no bones and ligaments that his body parts can twist around like rubberman. What?

The comical designs of the characters in the show makes it difficult to take things seriously. Roswaal truly looks like a clown, the same manner why I detested Mephisto in Blue Exorcist. Beatrice, although probably the only good character in the show that I liked, is a kuu-yandere loli magician. The two beast howlers that assist Subaru by emitting powerful howling waves, are wolf riding loli twins. Rem is a petite maid with big boobs, reminiscent of someone? That's right, Hestia, minus the maid part. 

ENJOYMENT:

If you made it all the way here, I thank you, for this is truly one of the longest reviews (and ranting) that I've ever wrote. It should be obvious at this point now how much I detested the show. Truly sorry, but Re:Zero was not the show for me. I was constantly annoyed by the way the story was told, was constantly annoyed by the ridiculous characters, and was constantly annoyed by the incomprehensible rave behind the show. 

An opinion is an opinion. I tried my best to wrote one, and this is what it became. If anything, I must praise Re:Zero for making me writing such a lengthy rant. 

OVERALL: 3/10 Poor."

happened, Nothing was even logical or made any sense, if any of us got dumped there we would be trying to find a way to get back but not Subaru, never gave that a thought. Then he decides to be in charge of the damn place and he decided to save everyone and gets obsessed with this girl called Satella. 

Then without reason he started to get killed over and over again and come back to life at a time skip point because why not. Then in the second half of the anime he stops dying and he spends his time rejecting a loli who fell in love with him, killing whale sharks because apparently they are dangerous and chasing that crazy green-haired psychopath. 

The whole anime was all over the place and does not making any logical sense. I watched this because it had the psychological genre and instead I get an overrated, overhyped loli-filled piece of shit of an anime. If you like watching trainwrecks and have an obsession with cliches then this show is for you."

this an excellent anime.It has a perfect balance of darkness,comedy,sadness and at some parts this anime comes across to be extremely beautiful and even romantic.Its one of those rare animes that you would want to watch over and over again and never get bored!

Re:Zero rocked the anime world in 2016 and was named the new king of the Isekai genre. Re:Zero took the crown from Overlord Season 1, which had usurped Log Horizon, which had overthrown Sword Art Online in the famous coup d'état led by Digibro. The scramble for supremacy continues in anime's shittiest genre. Yes, I hate Isekai even more than I hate harem anime. However, I'm not just writing this review to rehash my opinion that anime would be better off if .Hack had been The Last Isekai back in 2002. 

Plot:

Re:Zero is about a gamer geek named Subaru who closes his eyes and wakes
                  ...
up in another world. This is of course a fantasy world that operates similar to JRPGS. Subaru is rather thrilled by this and immediately tests to see if he has any powers. It turns out he has the awesome power to reverse time by a few hours or days. However, this power only triggers when he dies. While Subaru is effectively immortal, this means he has to go through a LOT of suffering to get a happy ending.

This plot, combined with the jarring tone shifts between goofy comedy and brutal violence, means that comparisions to Higurashi are inevitable. I was told by one of my offline friends that if I loved Higurashi, I would of course love Re:Zero. Well...I wanted to love Re:Zero. However, I find it comes up very short against Higurashi. Allow me to compare and contrast for a moment.

(Spoilers if you haven't seen Higurashi.)

Rika and Subaru both have essentially the same ability. However, there are some key differences. Subaru just needs to survive one major event and then he gets a new ""Savepoint"". His first task is to not get killed by 3 thugs in an alley and not get killed that night by an assassin. If he lives to the next day, he never has to relive the first day. Rika needs to save an entire village from an evil organization. If she dies, there are no checkpoints and she has to relive the same 3-5 months! Subaru gets to remember how he died and all details about his last life. Rika isn't allowed to remember who killed her or key information from previous timelines. She has to solve it all in 1 perfect go. Subaru immediatly stumbles into super OP allies to help him survive. Rika's only allies are a buch of punk kids with no powers or special abilities. Subaru at most has to retry 3-5 times to reach the next checkpoint. Rika spent over 100 years suffering to achieve her victory. When Rika FINALLY pulls off the upset and defeats Takano and her forces, it's one of the greatest feel good moments in anime. When Subaru wins in Re:Zero...meh.

Art:

I'm going to be honest in the fact I don't like the studio White Fox. I find their CGI very intrusive and shoddy. The character art is...fine. It's not a hideous looking anime by any means, but nothing blew me away either.

Overall:

I didn't actually hate Re:Zero, but I did find it very disappointing. Perhaps I went into it with my hopes WAY too high. It was probably just a victim of overhype, but I can't say I enjoyed this one very much. I also didn't feel it went anywhere that other anime haven't explored far better. Re:Zero is just pure average, white bread. It's fine, but completely unremarkable in every aspect."

                                      (13/25 eps)","Let's not waste any time : this show is shit.  But why is it shit?  When i was watching, i thought that it could be one of two possibilities :

1. Not unlike Apple with the iphone7, the creators were seeing just how bad of a product they could intentionally make, and still have people fall for it.
2. The show was written by somebody no older than 15 who was trying really hard to look way smarter than he actually is.

So what's wrong with it?  I want to say everything, because there is no facet of this series that is well-executed.  The
                  ...
episodes follow a predictable structure : 20 minutes of slice of life, and then a CRAZY PLOT TWIST during the last two minutes.  This is because the protagonist goes back in time after dying.  So the idea is that he dies at the end in a very ""surprising"" way, and then you get to re-watch the same time period as he tries to change things in order to survive.  The concept isn't bad, there is potential here. But the execution is bad.  Bad.  In the lead-up to Subaru dying, it is just so tremendously boring. The amount of rambling and forced attempts at humor fall short of delivering any kind of entertainment what-so-ever.

But sometimes, during the non-twist part of the show, you get a break from the bad comedy and you get an action scene.  This is where it really tests your patience, because it's profoundly annoying, not just bad.  Whenever there's a combat scene, you get maybe 5 seconds of action, and then the characters pause to talk shit to each other, probably for a good minute.  Can you imagine a battle in medieval times, and after a few sword blows traded, both armies pause and start talking smack?  Sounds retarded?  It is.  

The characters, you've guessed it, are another huge problem.  There are a few of them that are decent and somewhat entertaining (Betty and Roswal), but the rest are abominations.  
The protagonist never shuts up with his ""epic one liners"" that only a 13 year old could think are cool.  Emilia is a pure plot device whose personality entirely depends on the requirements of the current scene.  The maids are the most annoying though.  Rem goes from killing the protag in one timeline, to practically falling in love with him in the next, with just about no motivation for the change.  Protag went back in time about 3 days and through small changes in his actions, changed her actions completely!  Isn't that convenient.  B-but but the butterfly effect!  Nah.  This writing is so bad that it makes the latest season of Game Of Thrones look like pure brilliance.  Seriously, only a teenager could come up with this and think it's good.

Probably the biggest offender in the show is the sheer quantity of cliches.  It's not a few here and there.  It's everything.  Everything.  like 80% of it is copy-pasted from various other sources. 

""push you out of the way of a car/stampede and get hit myself"" check
""you pretend to do it for me but you're just selfish!"" check
""protag says some deep line and girl starts smiling and tearing up as wind starts to blow in her hair"" check

Nothing in this show is genuine.  Nothing. 

So now you'll ask me how in the world i made it to episode 13.  There is one thing that this show does well, and it's hook you with little doubts, cliffhangers, etc.  It really makes you believe that in the end there will be some sort of complexity to this story, if you hang-on long enough.  I never expected it to become good, but it's more like morbid curiosity.  ""How can they possibly explain this stupid thing, or will they just hope we forget about it?"".  The other thing that kept me going
is the prospect of writing a really bad review for it.  I wanted more material to complain about.  Now that i wrote it, i feel pretty good.  Was it worth it?  No.  

Bottom line is, if you've finished high school, don't even try watching this.  You might think you can watch it on 3-4 layers of irony (that's mostly what i did) and get some enjoyment out of it, but you probably won't."

To long, Didn't read Version: Watch this Anime! It's worth your time investment, that's a promise. 

So people, I'm ashamed and ecstatic to say that I started and finished this show in 2 days (with no sleep). From the first episode it had me hooked and wouldn't let go. The premis at first seemed like your run-of-the-mill mmo ""transported to another world"" style Anime. But then I noticed that this one didn't use the cliche' nerve gear or ""this was gods doing"" entry point. +1 for originality right there dude. Anyways here goes.

Story-10
You've all probably seen this genre of
                  ...
Anime before. With shows like Konosuba, Log Horizon, and the infamous Sword Art Online. Fortunately, Re:Zero isn't just another copy and paste. Without spoiling anything, the transition from our MCs' world to his new fantasy world was quick! They didn't waste any time with explanations (which may be a good or bad thing) or even the whole ""lost and confused"" cliche'. Instead our protagonist acknowledges that he has indeed been transported to a new world (with all the Cat-Girls you could want) and sets off on what he believes is his own personal adventure (Little does he know that the world does not revolve around him, instead he just become a cog in a much, much larger machine) 

Art-7
Art is not my field of expertise, but, I can recognize the difference between Your Name and Berserk 2016. With that I can tell you that this Anime is ""OK"" in the art department. For instance, The first thing I noticed when our MC was swept away and placed in a town square, is that all of the back ground characters have really weird walking animations. That stays persistent throughout the show. The fight scenes are OK. Besides that it's really just average at best. 

Sound-9
To be honest, I couldn't care less about the opening. For me you have to make a great first impression and if it doesn't catch me immediately then I'll skip past it for the rest of the series. That was the case with Re:Zero. Now on the other hand, that ending song! 
When the singer sang the first two lines she had me. I can honestly say that it takes a lot of epic ness to give me goosebumps, and that's what this did. Along with the soundtrack, it's definitely a 9/10 for me. 

Character-7 
Okay so the good first. Rem, what'd you think? In all honesty, this is the best female character in any anime I've ever seen. At first you'll be angry with her, then you'll be happy, then sad, and next thing you know your happy-crying like a baby. Rem sent me on a roller coster of emotions and I enjoyed every second of it. 

Now for the bad. The MC is great in the beginning (even though he isn't bothered with learning anything about this new world). I genuinely enjoyed watching his encounters and how his optimistic attitude helped him solve the small problems he came across. 
But about half way through I noticed that he was pretty stupid. Once I noticed this it's like the show wanted to show you exactly how dumb he really is. I mean, we're talking about a guy with barley any common sense. It's like everything is always new to him. By that I mean no matter how many times he runs into the same type of problem, he acts like it's his first time dealing with it. This guy couldn't come up with the simplest solution if it was written down for him (and it basically is). As a viewer, I don't enjoy watching a idiot try and deal with problems. If I wanted that I'd watch jersey shore. 

The other characters are alright. They might even be good but I can't tell when they are in the same anime as Rem.

Enjoyment-9
I mean it's great dude. What are you waiting for? Mommy to tell you it's Okay? I promise you won't be disappointed. 



P.S. There's definitely a lot more that I can say about how great this one is and how you should watch it immediately. But hopefully if you read this post then your convinced. Anyways, thanks for reading and HF!"
